The background attribute is used to specify the background color of the view, which in this case is bgColor.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":13547561,"reputation":3338,"user_id":9773423,"display_name":"Taki"},"score":0,"creation_date":1681325273,"post_id":75994012,"comment_id":134039866,"body_markdown":"Thank you mate , i appreciate it , it did actually work , one thing is that those cut corners , can i set their color to transparent , i mainly need only area within white stroke to be black , but those corners outside the white stroke should be transaparent , can i set this within the custom class ?","body":"Thank you mate , i appreciate it , it did actually work , one thing is that those cut corners , can i set their color to transparent , i mainly need only area within white stroke to be black , but those corners outside the white stroke should be transaparent , can i set this within the custom class ?"},{"owner":{"account_id":27874078,"reputation":36,"user_id":21283922,"display_name":"Nguyễn Văn Huy"},"score":0,"creation_date":1681879342,"post_id":75994012,"comment_id":134126154,"body_markdown":"Yes, you can.

Let&#39;s see an example,\r\n\r\n**Step#1**:  You need to have a `main` method to execute the code as java program not as junit test. \r\n\r\n    import org.junit.internal.TextListener;\r\n    import org.junit.runner.JUnitCore;\r\n    \r\n    public class Main {\r\n    \tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    \t\tSystem.setProperty(&quot;cucumber.options&quot;, &quot;--tags @Login&quot;); //You can use the tag what you are reading from excel here.\r\n    \t\tJUnitCore junit = new JUnitCore();\r\n    \t\tjunit.addListener(new TextListener(System.out));\r\n    \t\tjunit.run(Runner.class);\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Step#2**: Remove `tags` option from `Runner` class.\r\n\r\n    @RunWith(Cucumber.class)\r\n    @CucumberOptions(features = &quot;src\\\\test\\\\resources\\\\Features&quot;, glue = { &quot;code&quot; })\r\n    public class Runner {\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Step#3**: Run your `main` method.\r\n\r\n**Feature file**:\r\n\r\n    Feature: Application\r\n    \r\n      @Login\r\n      Scenario: Login\r\n        Given Login to the application\r\n    \r\n      @Logout\r\n      Scenario: Login\r\n        Given Logout from the application\r\n\r\n**Step definition**:\r\n\r\n    public class StepDefs {\r\n    \r\n    \t@Given(&quot;^Login to the application$&quot;)\r\n    \tpublic void login() {\r\n    \t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Logged into the application&quot;);\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \t@Given(&quot;^Logout from the application$&quot;)\r\n    \tpublic void logout() {\r\n    \t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Logged out from the application&quot;);\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Output**:\r\n\r\n    Logged into the application\r\n    \r\n    1 Scenarios (\u001B[32m1 passed\u001B[0m)\r\n    1 Steps (\u001B[32m1 passed\u001B[0m)\r\n    0m0.477s","title":"Fetching Tag from excel sheet and trying to pass the same tag in cucumber options in cucumber framework","body":"<p>You cannot pass the tags directly to the <code>runner</code> class.

But the compiler wouldn&#39;t allow you to add elements to `yList` because it can&#39;t be sure the elements match the original generic boundary of the list.\r\n\r\nTo summarize:\r\n\r\n    //defining exact boundaries\r\n    List&lt;X&gt; xList = getXList(); //works as you get a List&lt;X&gt;\r\n    List&lt;X&gt; yList = getYList();  //doesn&#39;t work as the generic boundaries don&#39;t match\r\n\r\n    //defining upper bounds, i.e. X or any subclass\r\n    List&lt;? extends X&gt; atLeastXList = getYList();  //works, as the boundaries state X or subclasses\r\n    X first = atLeastXList.get(0); //works, as the boundaries state elements are at least of type X\r\n    Y second = atLeastXList.get(1); //doesn&#39;t work as the compiler only knows the elements have at least type X\r\n   \r\n    atLeastXList.add(new X()); //doesn&#39;t work as the compiler can&#39;t be sure this would be allowed (it wouldn&#39;t as the list would actually be a List&lt;Y&gt; in your case)\r\n\r\n    //defining lower bounds, i.e. X or any super class\r\n    List&lt;? super X&gt; atMostXList = getXList();  //works, as X is the lower boundary\r\n    List&lt;? super X&gt; brokenAtLeastXList = getYList();  //doesn&#39;t work as Y is not a super class of X \r\n   \r\n    atMostXList.add(new X()); //works as any matching list will allow instances off X (e.g. it could actually be a List&lt;Object&gt; which be fine too)\r\n    atMostXList.add(new Y()); //works as Y extends X\r\n    atMostXList.add(new Object()); //doesn&#39;t work as the list could actually require only X instances to be added\r\n\r\nFor more information, look up the [PECS rule](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2723397/what-is-pecs-producer-extends-consumer-super)","title":"Why can&#39;t I set a List&lt;Y&gt; to a variable of type List&lt;X&gt; where the Y extends X in Java?","body":"<p>You should read up more on generics.

But why should I do that and leave it like that, knowing that a hacker can, just like me, execute this command and get actual value:\r\n\r\nHe can do this, and he has everything he needs - he can read both &quot;**u7uKa3B9Xfey+zZ46tOmag==**&quot; and &quot;**pass**&quot; from my code:\r\ndecrypt: \r\n\r\n    mvn jasypt:decrypt-value -Djasypt.plugin.value=&quot;u7uKa3B9Xfey+zZ46tOmag==&quot; -Djasypt.encryptor.password=&quot;pass&quot; -Djasypt.encryptor.algorithm=&quot;PBEWithMD5AndDES&quot; -Djasypt.encryptor.key-obtention-iterations=1000 -Djasypt.encryptor.pool-size=1 -Djasypt.encryptor.provider-name=&quot;SunJCE&quot; -Djasypt.encryptor.salt-generator-classname=&quot;org.jasypt.salt.RandomSaltGenerator&quot; -Djasypt.encryptor.iv-generator-classname=&quot;org.jasypt.iv.NoIvGenerator&quot; -Djasypt.encryptor.string-output-type=&quot;base64&quot;\r\n\r\nHe just needs to read this ENC(**u7uKa3B9Xfey+zZ46tOmag==**) (which he can, from yml file, and &quot;**pass**&quot; also from yml file (he can do this also). And there it is, he can get original value back. I don&#39;t see any security in this. Hacker only needs to know how to execute mvn decrypt command (I&#39;ve managed to do it here in this example, why someone wouldn&#39;t manage to do it also), and it&#39;s basically same as encrypt.\r\n\r\nSomeone might argue, &#39;well, you can pass your password (&quot;pass&quot;) through environment variable&#39;. Doesn&#39;t work for me. Because both files for Gitlab and Dockerfile, I have both in project, and if I set those variables there, still hacker can read it and it get actual value in a matter of seconds. They are bind to my project. Also, providing actual passwords like environmental variables on systems like Gitlab or Kubernetes seems very risky to me. Hacker, if he is very advanced, can read those values also. So why expose them. And seems that is only solution from Jasypt, to set variables like APP_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD.\r\n\r\n**My question is can you somehow disable Jasypt decrypt, in order not to get actual value back, so hacker can&#39;t also get to it? That seems to be safest option to me. Or some similar solution to solve my problem? Provide an example if you can, please.**  It would be good that Jasypt can somehow generate password on the fly, just like it generates salt, but how. I know, then person should dynamically populate yml file and that is not possible. I really can&#39;t see how is this with Jasypt secure if I only need password and encrypted value to decrypt original value back. Both those hacker can read in source code and that seems very bad security in my opinion. And then, what is the purpose of masking database passoword in yml file. If everything can be unpacked in matter of seconds. This seem very weak security to me. Please inform me how can I make it more secure than the way it is now.","title":"How to make safe encryption with Jasypt?","body":"<p>On jasypt.org regarding question &quot;<strong>Can I decrypt an encrypted password?</strong>&quot; it says here  <a href=\"http://www.jasypt.org/faq.html#does-jasypt-implement-algorithms\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.jasypt.org/faq.html#does-jasypt-implement-algorithms</a> :\n&quot;If you have encrypted it using a message digesting technique, which is precisely what you should have done (by using a PasswordEncryptor implementation, StandardStringDigester or similar...), <strong>you cannot</strong>.&quot;</p>\n<p>I must say I've tried in various ways, but it seems to me I always have same problem.\nI am not aware why Jasypt makes it possible for everyone to decrypt to original value.

Hacker only needs to know how to execute mvn decrypt command (I've managed to do it here in this example, why someone wouldn't manage to do it also), and it's basically same as encrypt.</p>\n<p>Someone might argue, 'well, you can pass your password (&quot;pass&quot;) through environment variable'. Doesn't work for me. Because both files for Gitlab and Dockerfile, I have both in project, and if I set those variables there, still hacker can read it and it get actual value in a matter of seconds. They are bind to my project. Also, providing actual passwords like environmental variables on systems like Gitlab or Kubernetes seems very risky to me. Hacker, if he is very advanced, can read those values also. So why expose them. And seems that is only solution from Jasypt, to set variables like APP_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD.</p>\n<p><strong>My question is can you somehow disable Jasypt decrypt, in order not to get actual value back, so hacker can't also get to it? That seems to be safest option to me. Or some similar solution to solve my problem? Provide an example if you can, please.</strong>  It would be good that Jasypt can somehow generate password on the fly, just like it generates salt, but how. I know, then person should dynamically populate yml file and that is not possible. I really can't see how is this with Jasypt secure if I only need password and encrypted value to decrypt original value back. Both those hacker can read in source code and that seems very bad security in my opinion. And then, what is the purpose of masking database passoword in yml file. If everything can be unpacked in matter of seconds. This seem very weak security to me. Please inform me how can I make it more secure than the way it is now.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","netty","socks"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":14915903,"reputation":39,"user_id":10769727,"display_name":"Nplt2333"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1598539292,"creation_date":1598539292,"answer_id":63618468,"question_id":61979894,"body_markdown":"    Bootstrap bootstrap = new Bootstrap();\r\n    bootstrap.resolver(NoopAddressResolverGroup.INSTANCE);\r\n\r\nis OK.","title":"Netty how to resolve dns on socks proxy?","body":"<pre><code>Bootstrap bootstrap = new Bootstrap();\nbootstrap.resolver(NoopAddressResolverGroup.INSTANCE);\n</code></pre>\n<p>is OK.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":10253730,"reputation":11,"user_id":7567122,"display_name":"baiyang"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1681284838,"creation_date":1681284838,"answer_id":75992993,"question_id":61979894,"body_markdown":"see https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7487\r\n\r\n```java\r\nBootstrap bootstrap = new Bootstrap();\r\nbootstrap.resolver(NoopAddressResolverGroup.INSTANCE);\r\n```\r\nthis works for me.","title":"Netty how to resolve dns on socks proxy?","body":"<p>see <a href=\"https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7487\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/7487</a></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>Bootstrap bootstrap = new Bootstrap();\nbootstrap.resolver(NoopAddressResolverGroup.INSTANCE);\n</code></pre>\n<p>this works for me.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":11444338,"reputation":45,"user_id":12998115,"display_name":"KopeMorta"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":758,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1681284838,"creation_date":1590276915,"question_id":61979894,"body_markdown":"How to resolve host name remote when i use SocksProxy ?\r\nAs i can see ```Socks5ProxyHandler``` (4 ty) allow this.\r\n```java\r\nif (raddr.isUnresolved()) {\r\n    addrType = Socks5AddressType.DOMAIN;\r\n    rhost = raddr.getHostString();\r\n} else {\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut netty always resolve dns on call ```connect()```.

The `Date#toString` method lies to you.\r\n\r\nIf handed a legacy `java.util.Date` object, immediately convert to `java.time.Instant`.\r\n\r\n    Instant instant = myJavaUtilDate.toInstant() ;\r\n\r\nThen apply your desired time zone.\r\n\r\n    ZonedDateTime zdt = instant.atZone( ZoneId.of( &quot;Asia/Dubai&quot; ) ) ;\r\n\r\n# Use only *java.time*\r\n\r\nYour date-time handling should involve **only the *java.time* classes**. \r\n\r\nThe date-time classes outside that package are now legacy, terribly flawed in poor design. The legacy classes were supplanted by *java.time* in JSR 310, implemented in Java 8+.\r\n\r\nYou said:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// initailize date object\r\nDate date = new Date();\r\n```\r\n\r\nDid you mean `java.util.Date` or `java.sql.Date`? Both are legacy. \r\n\r\n - The first was replaced by `java.time.Instant`. Both the legacy and modern classes represent a moment as seen with an offset from UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds.\r\n - The second was replaced by `java.time.LocalDate`. The legacy class *pretends* to represent a date-only, but because of faulty design it actually contains a time-of-day and an assumption of an offset of zero. In contrast, the modern class truly represents a date-only, without time-of-day, and without time zone or offset.\r\n\r\nInstead use this code:\r\n\r\n    Instant instant = Instant.now() ;  // Capture the current moment as seen in UTC (zero offset).\r\n\r\nYou said:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// get time zone\r\nZoneId zoneId = ZoneId.of(&quot;Asia/Dubai&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nGood. A `ZoneId` is the modern way to represent a time zone.
