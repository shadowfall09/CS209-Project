Again, <code>Future</code> is a one-shot.</p>\n<p>Instead, use a <code>Runnable</code> with the appropriate fixed rate or fixed delay API. Do whatever you want to do with the &quot;result&quot; inside your task itself. The task could offer something like a callback to decouple consumption of the &quot;result&quot; from its production, which is implemented currently in your <code>Callable</code>.</p>\n<p>Here's a rough example:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>final class Task&lt;V&gt; implements Runnable {\n\n    private final Supplier&lt;? extends V&gt; producer;\n    private final Consumer&lt;? super V&gt; consumer;\n\n    Task(Supplier&lt;? extends V&gt; producer, Consumer&lt;? super V&gt; consumer) {\n        this.producer = Objects.requireNonNull(producer);\n        this.consumer = Objects.requireNonNull(consumer);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        V result = producer.get();\n        consumer.accept(result);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String... arg) {\n        Runnable task = new Task&lt;&gt;(() -&gt; &quot;Hello, World!&quot;, System.out::println);\n        ScheduledExecutorService worker = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();\n        Future&lt;?&gt; cancellable = worker.scheduleWithFixedDelay(task, 1L, 1L, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\n        TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(8L);\n        cancellable.cancel(false);\n        System.out.println(&quot;Canceled&quot;);\n        worker.shutdown();\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You might choose to handle errors from the producer, consumer, or both. An additional callback could be added for that. Implementations might log, alert, stop the task, etc. (In that case, you might use <code>Callable</code> in place of <code>Supplier</code>.)</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":24248720,"reputation":1,"user_id":18200041,"display_name":"Danaby"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":203,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1646181708,"creation_date":1646000348,"question_id":71288890,"body_markdown":"I am using a `ScheduledExecutorService` to execute callables after a given delay, I want to make these repeatable so i created the following class\r\n\r\n    class ReschedulableCallable&lt;V&gt; implements Callable&lt;V&gt; {\r\n       private final ScheduledExecutorService executorService;\r\n       private final Callable&lt;V&gt; callable;\r\n\r\n       public ReschedulableCallable(\r\n        ScheduledExecutorService executorService, Callable&lt;V&gt; callable) {\r\n        this.executorService = executorService;\r\n        this.callable = callable;\r\n        executorService.schedule(this, 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       @Override\r\n       public V call() throws Exception {\r\n          try {\r\n             return callable.call();\r\n          } finally {\r\n             executorService.schedule(this, 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nbut the callable is only executable once not repeated like i need, even i am initializing it after is called, also please dont say use `ScheduledExecutorService.scheduleAtFixedRate` or `ScheduledExecutorService.scheduleWithFixedDelay` as i want it to return with generic type, so why is this?","title":"Reschedulable Callable","body":"<p>I am using a <code>ScheduledExecutorService</code> to execute callables after a given delay, I want to make these repeatable so i created the following class</p>\n<pre><code>class ReschedulableCallable&lt;V&gt; implements Callable&lt;V&gt; {\n   private final ScheduledExecutorService executorService;\n   private final Callable&lt;V&gt; callable;\n\n   public ReschedulableCallable(\n    ScheduledExecutorService executorService, Callable&lt;V&gt; callable) {\n    this.executorService = executorService;\n    this.callable = callable;\n    executorService.schedule(this, 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\n   }\n\n   @Override\n   public V call() throws Exception {\n      try {\n         return callable.call();\n      } finally {\n         executorService.schedule(this, 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\n     }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>but the callable is only executable once not repeated like i need, even i am initializing it after is called, also please dont say use <code>ScheduledExecutorService.scheduleAtFixedRate</code> or <code>ScheduledExecutorService.scheduleWithFixedDelay</code> as i want it to return with generic type, so why is this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","mongodb","minecraft"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":15178500,"reputation":4190,"user_id":10952503,"display_name":"Elikill58"},"score":0,"creation_date":1636324861,"post_id":69876602,"comment_id":123519933,"body_markdown":"Have you check that the Mongodb code was well on the given jar ?

When the program runs, it should do the following:\n\n *   Ask the user to enter the amount of money she wants to insert into the slot machine.\n *   Instead of displaying images, the program will randomly select a word from the following list: Cherries, Oranges, Plums, Bells, Melons, Bars. \n     The program will select and display a word from this list three times (like the three columns in a real slot machine).\n *   If none of the randomly selected words match, the program will inform the user that she has won $0. \n *   If two of the words match, the program will inform the user that she has won twice the amount wagered in the first step. \n *   If all three of the words match, the program will inform the user that she has won three times the amount entered.\n *   The program will ask whether the user wants to play again. \n      If so, these steps are repeated. \n      If not, the program displays the total amount of money entered into the slot machine and the total amount won.\n*/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is revised code with the compiler errors commented out next tot the line number for which they appeat    </p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.util.Scanner;\nimport java.util.Random;\n\npublic class SlotMachineHWCH6\n{\n\n   public static void Main(String[] args)\n   {\n      //declarations\n      Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);  //for user input\n      //string slotMachine;   //don't know if will be used\n      //double initialPlayerBet;  //first bet\n      double playerBet = 0;  //subsequent bets\n      //double totalPlayerBets; //total amount user spent in the slot machine\n      double totalWinnings = 0;   //total amount won\n      double tripleWin = 0;   //amount won when all 3 match\n      double doubleWin = 0;   //amount won when 2 match\n\n      String spin, spin1, spin2, spin3;    \n      int i;                       //counter variable\n      String no;\n      String yes;       \n      boolean keepPlaying;  //response to prompt to continue playing\n\n      System.out.println(\"Slot machine payout: 3 items match - win triple your bet. 2 items match = win double your bet.
