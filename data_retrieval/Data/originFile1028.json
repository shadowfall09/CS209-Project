So when it comes to Kotlin, one of the best features in my opinion is represented by the <a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kotlin Coroutines</a>.</p>\n<p>For simple Firestore reads I recommend you read the following resource:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.com/firebase-tips-tricks/how-to-read-data-from-cloud-firestore-using-get-bf03b6ee4953\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">How to read data from Cloud Firestore using get()?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>When it comes to updating millions of documents, doing that in your Android application's code, doesn't sound like a good solution. The best option that you have, in my opinion, is to use <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cloud Functions for Firebase</a>. So you'll be able to create a query using multiple <code>whereEqualTo()</code> calls, and everything will be performed on the server.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":26090846,"reputation":113,"user_id":19787762,"display_name":"Vince Yba&#241;ez"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":174,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":73761869,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1663497962,"creation_date":1663489589,"question_id":73761176,"body_markdown":"I have an app that contains millions of documents per Collection. \r\nMy app is created using Android Java with Firestore Database. \r\nThe problem is that Firestore&#39;s batched write can only update up to 500 documents.

As the rules for US calendars have not been spec&#39;ed out clearly as a standard (like ISO8601) the most common rule seems to be that Jan 1st defined the first calendar week (based on weeks starting on Sunday and ending on Saturday). Note that many publicly available US calendars found on a well-known search engine contain incorrect week indices because of incorrectly determined first calender weeks.\r\n\r\nI wrote a small (unpolished) programm to calculate the weeks based on this:\r\n\r\n````\r\nimport java.util.HashMap;\r\nimport java.util.Map;\r\n\r\nimport org.joda.time.LocalDate;\r\nimport org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormat;\r\nimport org.joda.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;\r\n\r\nimport junit.framework.TestCase;\r\n\r\npublic class GenerateCWs_TestCase extends TestCase {\r\n\r\n\tpublic void test_generate() {\r\n\r\n\t\tint startYear = 2015;\r\n\t\tint EndYear = 2028;\r\n\r\n\t\tMap&lt;Integer, LocalDate&gt; cw1StartDates = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n\t\tDateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormat.forPattern(&quot;yyyyMMdd&quot;);\r\n\r\n\t\tfor (int year = startYear; year &lt;= EndYear + 1; year++) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\tLocalDate firstDayInYear = formatter.parseLocalDate(year + &quot;0101&quot;);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Jan 1st. &quot; + year + &quot; -&gt; day of week: &quot; + firstDayInYear.getDayOfWeek());\r\n\r\n\t\t\tLocalDate sundayOfFirstWeek = firstDayInYear.getDayOfWeek() != 7\r\n\t\t\t\t\t? firstDayInYear.minusDays(firstDayInYear.getDayOfWeek() - 1 + 1)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t: firstDayInYear;\r\n\r\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;CW1 starts on: &quot; + formatter.print(sundayOfFirstWeek));\r\n\r\n\t\t\tcw1StartDates.put(year, sundayOfFirstWeek);\r\n\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tfor (int year = startYear; year &lt;= EndYear; year++) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\tLocalDate sundayDateOfWeek = cw1StartDates.get(year);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tint weekIndex = 1;\r\n\r\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(String.format(&quot;CW %02d/%d - Sunday of Week: %s&quot;, weekIndex, year,\r\n\t\t\t\t\tformatter.print(sundayDateOfWeek)));\r\n\r\n\t\t\twhile (sundayDateOfWeek.plusWeeks(1).isBefore(cw1StartDates.get(year + 1))) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tsundayDateOfWeek = sundayDateOfWeek.plusWeeks(1);\r\n\t\t\t\tweekIndex++;\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tif (weekIndex &lt;= 2 || weekIndex &gt;= 51)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSystem.out.println(String.format(&quot;CW %02d/%d - Sunday of Week: %s&quot;, weekIndex, year,\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tformatter.print(sundayDateOfWeek)));\r\n\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println();\r\n\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nwhich outputs:\r\n\r\n````\r\nCW 01/2015 - Sunday of Week: 20141228\r\nCW 02/2015 - Sunday of Week: 20150104\r\nCW 51/2015 - Sunday of Week: 20151213\r\nCW 52/2015 - Sunday of Week: 20151220\r\nCW 01/2016 - Sunday of Week: 20151227\r\nCW 02/2016 - Sunday of Week: 20160103\r\nCW 51/2016 - Sunday of Week: 20161211\r\nCW 52/2016 - Sunday of Week: 20161218\r\nCW 53/2016 - Sunday of Week: 20161225\r\nCW 01/2017 - Sunday of Week: 20170101\r\nCW 02/2017 - Sunday of Week: 20170108\r\nCW 51/2017 - Sunday of Week: 20171217\r\nCW 52/2017 - Sunday of Week: 20171224\r\nCW 01/2018 - Sunday of Week: 20171231\r\nCW 02/2018 - Sunday of Week: 20180107\r\nCW 51/2018 - Sunday of Week: 20181216\r\nCW 52/2018 - Sunday of Week: 20181223\r\nCW 01/2019 - Sunday of Week: 20181230\r\nCW 02/2019 - Sunday of Week: 20190106\r\nCW 51/2019 - Sunday of Week: 20191215\r\nCW 52/2019 - Sunday of Week: 20191222\r\nCW 01/2020 - Sunday of Week: 20191229\r\nCW 02/2020 - Sunday of Week: 20200105\r\nCW 51/2020 - Sunday of Week: 20201213\r\nCW 52/2020 - Sunday of Week: 20201220\r\nCW 01/2021 - Sunday of Week: 20201227\r\nCW 02/2021 - Sunday of Week: 20210103\r\nCW 51/2021 - Sunday of Week: 20211212\r\nCW 52/2021 - Sunday of Week: 20211219\r\nCW 01/2022 - Sunday of Week: 20211226\r\nCW 02/2022 - Sunday of Week: 20220102\r\nCW 51/2022 - Sunday of Week: 20221211\r\nCW 52/2022 - Sunday of Week: 20221218\r\nCW 53/2022 - Sunday of Week: 20221225\r\nCW 01/2023 - Sunday of Week: 20230101\r\nCW 02/2023 - Sunday of Week: 20230108\r\nCW 51/2023 - Sunday of Week: 20231217\r\nCW 52/2023 - Sunday of Week: 20231224\r\nCW 01/2024 - Sunday of Week: 20231231\r\nCW 02/2024 - Sunday of Week: 20240107\r\nCW 51/2024 - Sunday of Week: 20241215\r\nCW 52/2024 - Sunday of Week: 20241222\r\nCW 01/2025 - Sunday of Week: 20241229\r\nCW 02/2025 - Sunday of Week: 20250105\r\nCW 51/2025 - Sunday of Week: 20251214\r\nCW 52/2025 - Sunday of Week: 20251221\r\nCW 01/2026 - Sunday of Week: 20251228\r\nCW 02/2026 - Sunday of Week: 20260104\r\nCW 51/2026 - Sunday of Week: 20261213\r\nCW 52/2026 - Sunday of Week: 20261220\r\nCW 01/2027 - Sunday of Week: 20261227\r\nCW 02/2027 - Sunday of Week: 20270103\r\nCW 51/2027 - Sunday of Week: 20271212\r\nCW 52/2027 - Sunday of Week: 20271219\r\nCW 01/2028 - Sunday of Week: 20271226\r\nCW 02/2028 - Sunday of Week: 20280102\r\nCW 51/2028 - Sunday of Week: 20281210\r\nCW 52/2028 - Sunday of Week: 20281217\r\nCW 53/2028 - Sunday of Week: 20281224\r\n````\r\n\r\nSo year 2022 has a calendar week 53 in the US calendar.

Programs not aware of this would silently continue processing with the returned calendar date from week 52 although the input was calendar week 53.\r\n\r\nThe use of ResolverStyle.STRICT *does not* make any difference in this case.\r\n\r\nThe only protection possible is to calculate a calendar date for a given year+week and then add an additional check by reversing the calculation. If input week and output week are mismatching then the described misbehaviour occurred and special handling in client code is required.\r\n\r\nOle was so kind to report a bug: [JDK-8293146 : Strict DateTimeFormatter fails to report an invalid week 53 in the Oracle Java Bug Database][2].

Programs not aware of this would silently continue processing with the returned calendar date from week 52 although the input was calendar week 53.</p>\n<p>The use of ResolverStyle.STRICT <em>does not</em> make any difference in this case.</p>\n<p>The only protection possible is to calculate a calendar date for a given year+week and then add an additional check by reversing the calculation. If input week and output week are mismatching then the described misbehaviour occurred and special handling in client code is required.</p>\n<p>Ole was so kind to report a bug: <a href=\"https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8293146\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JDK-8293146 : Strict DateTimeFormatter fails to report an invalid week 53 in the Oracle Java Bug Database</a>.

milliseconds) / 1000) != 10) {\r\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;1&quot;);\r\n\t\t\tif ((int) ((System.currentTimeMillis() - milliseconds) / 1000) == 10) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.remove(hitButton);\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.add(finishedHitCount);\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.add(finishedMissCount);\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.add(hitMissRatio);\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.add(hitTimeRatio);\r\n\t\t\t\tvalidate();\r\n\t\t\t\trepaint();\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\nThe while loop is working fine, the issue I&#39;m having is that the code before it that removes stuff isn&#39;t working, almost like it&#39;s skipping that snippet of code.\r\n\r\nFull Code (Might not be necessary but if you want it):\r\n```\r\npackage TrainingButtons;\r\n\r\nimport java.awt.Color;\r\nimport java.awt.Font;\r\nimport java.awt.Toolkit;\r\nimport java.awt.event.ActionEvent;\r\nimport java.awt.event.ActionListener;\r\nimport java.awt.event.MouseEvent;\r\nimport java.awt.event.MouseListener;\r\nimport java.text.DecimalFormat;\r\nimport java.util.Random;\r\n\r\nimport javax.swing.JButton;\r\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\r\nimport javax.swing.JLabel;\r\nimport javax.swing.SwingConstants;\r\n\r\npublic class GameFrame extends JFrame implements ActionListener, MouseListener{\r\n\t\r\n\tJButton hitButton;\r\n\tJButton endButton;\r\n\tJButton startButton;\r\n\tJButton startSixty;\r\n\tRandom random;\r\n\tJLabel finishedHitCount;\r\n\tJLabel finishedMissCount;\r\n\tJLabel hitMissRatio;\r\n\tJLabel totalTime;\r\n\tJLabel hitTimeRatio;\r\n\tJLabel beginning;\r\n\tJLabel startText;\r\n\tdouble hits;\r\n\tdouble misses;\r\n\tdouble milliseconds;\r\n\tdouble endTime;\r\n\tboolean found = true;\r\n\tMain main;\r\n\r\n\tGameFrame() {\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\trandom = new Random();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tthis.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\r\n\t\tthis.setSize(Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize());\r\n\t\tthis.setLayout(null);\r\n\t\tthis.setResizable(true);\r\n\t\taddMouseListener(this);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t//startText Design\r\n\t\tstartText = new JLabel(&quot;Quinn&#39;s Aim Trainer&quot;, SwingConstants.CENTER);\r\n\t\tstartText.setSize(getWidth(), 100);\r\n\t\tstartText.setFont(new Font(&quot;Apple Chancery&quot;, Font.BOLD, 75));\r\n\t\tstartText.setLocation(0, 75);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t//beginning Design\r\n\t\tbeginning = new JLabel(&quot;Press Start To Begin&quot;, SwingConstants.CENTER);\r\n\t\tbeginning.setSize(getWidth(), 100);\r\n\t\tbeginning.setFont(new Font(&quot;Copperplate&quot;, Font.BOLD, 75));\r\n\t\tbeginning.setLocation(0, 225);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t//startSixty Design\r\n\t\tstartSixty = new JButton();\r\n\t\tstartSixty.setSize(350, 100);\r\n\t\tstartSixty.setText(&quot;60 Second Round?&quot;);\r\n\t\tstartSixty.setFont(new Font(&quot;Copperplate&quot;, Font.BOLD, 30));\r\n\t\tstartSixty.setLocation((getWidth() -

The &quot;perfect&quot; value for that would probably be 10^x where `u.sqrt()` is between `0.5 * 10^x` and `5 * 10^x` (for radix 10). However such a calculation would be highly inefficient.\r\n\r\n(Maybe the factors 0.5 and 5 are not ideal - maybe they should be 0.316 and 3.16 so that 100 is choosen for values from 1000 to 100000 - but as this approach is not used the exact values don&#39;t matter.)\r\n\r\nInstead the code approximates that &quot;perfect&quot; value by using a value from the sequence radix^1, radix^2, radix^4 because these radix^(2^x) values are easy to calculate and still give good enough results.\r\n\r\nLets see how that calculation works for a `BigInteger` with a bitlength of 1024 (which has a string representation of length 308 to 309 characters).\r\n\r\nThe expression `(int) Math.round(Math.log(b * LOG_TWO / logCache[radix]) / LOG_TWO - 1.0)` is two calculations wrapped into one expression:\r\n\r\n- `b * LOG_TWO / logCache[radix]` calculates the approximate number of digits to represent the `BigInteger` value as string in radix `radix`\r\n\r\n   Note that `logCache[radix]` is initialized with `Math.log(radix)` and `LOG_TWO` is `Math.log(2)`, so the full expression is `b * Math.log(2) / Math.log(radix)`\r\n\r\n   For a `bitlength` of 1024 this calculation gives 308.2547 (rounded to 4 digits).\r\n\r\n   Lets name this intermediate result `num_digits`\r\n- The second calculation is then `(int) Math.round(Math.log(num_digits) / Math.log(2) - 1.0)`. For `num_digits` of 308.2547 this gives 7.\r\n\r\n   Therefore in our example the code will pick `10^(2^7)` (which is 10^128) as divisor to split the original number.\r\n\r\n**Why does it use `Math.round(x-1)` instead of `Math.floor(x)`?**\r\n\r\n*Note that this example uses a very small `bitlength` just to prove the point. Effectively this calculation is never done with so small values*\r\n\r\nIt gives a better value for `n`.\r\n\r\nTake for example a bitlength of 14 (the `BigInteger` value is between 8192 and 16383).\r\n\r\nUsing `Math.round(Math.log(b * LOG_TWO / logCache[radix]) / LOG_TWO - 1.0)` gives n=1, which means the code will choose `10^(2^1)` (which is 100) to split the `BigInteger`.\r\n\r\nUsing `Math.floor(Math.log(b * LOG_TWO / logCache[radix]) / LOG_TWO)` gives n =2, which would mean that the code would choose `10^(2^2)` (which is 10000) to split the `BigInteger` - but for a `BigInteger` value of 8192 that would mean it would not split it at all.\r\n\r\n*Using `Math.floor()` breaks down at several places:*\r\n\r\n- for the values 64 - 127 (bitlength = 7) using `Math.floor()` results in n=1 and u=100 and therefore cannot split values 64-99\r\n- for the values 8&#39;192 - 16&#39;383 (bitlength = 14) using `Math.floor()` results in in=2 and u=10&#39;000 and therefore cannot split values 8&#39;192 - 9&#39;999\r\n- for the values 67&#39;108&#39;864 - 134&#39;217&#39;727 (bitlength = 27) using `Math.floor()` results in in=3 and u=100&#39;000&#39;000 and therefore cannot split values 67&#39;108&#39;864 - 99&#39;999&#39;999\r\n- for the values 9&#39;007&#39;199&#39;254&#39;740&#39;992 - 18&#39;014&#39;398&#39;509&#39;481&#39;983 (bitlength = 54) using `Math.floor()` results in in=3 and u=10&#39;000&#39;000&#39;000&#39;000&#39;000 and therefore cannot split values 9&#39;007&#39;199&#39;254&#39;740&#39;992 - 9&#39;999&#39;999&#39;999&#39;999&#39;999\r\n\r\nFor those ranges (and there exist other ranges at larger bitlength values) you would need special handling after the split: if the upper part is BigInteger.ZERO then do some special handling. But any kind of special handling makes the algorithm more complex, more error prone and slower.\r\n\r\n*For other ranges using `Math.floor()` doesn&#39;t really give better results than using `Math.round()`:*\r\n\r\n- for the values 16&#39;384 - 99&#39;999 (bitlengths from 15 to 17) using `Math.floor()` results in in=2 and u=10&#39;000 and therefore the values are split into 1 digit and 4 digits.\r\n\r\n   Using `Math.round()` for these values results in n=1 and u=100 and therefore the values are split into 3 digits and 2 digits which to me seems more equally split.\r\n\r\n- for the values 100&#39;000 - 262&#39;143 (bitlengths from 17 to 18) using `Math.floor()` results in in=2 and u=10&#39;000 and therefore the values are split into 2 digits and 4 digits.\r\n    Using `Math.round()` for these values results in n=1 and u=100 and therefore the values are split into 4 digits and 2 digits.\r\n\r\n    For this range both approaches are on an equal level - either way you have a 4 digit number that you need to split further.\r\n\r\n**Why is that special case handling such a problem**\r\n\r\nLets try to convert the number 659&#39;876 into a decimal string.\r\n\r\nBoth approaches (using Math.floor() and using Math.round()) agree that we should use n=2 and u=10&#39;000 in the first step.\r\n\r\nUsing the calculation with Math.floor():\r\n\r\n- in the first step 659&#39;876 is split into 65 and 9&#39;876\r\n  - recursion 1: 65 - is a special case, needs additional work to split it into 6 and 5\r\n  - recursion 2: 9&#39;876 - is a special case, needs additional work to split it into 98 and 76\r\n    - recursion 2.1: 98 - is a special case, needs additional work to split it into 9 and 7\r\n    - recursion 2.2: 76 - is a special case, needs additional work to split it into 7 and 6\r\n\r\n(the last recursive step that appends the single digit values to the StringBuilder has been left out).\r\n\r\nUsing the calculation with Math.round():\r\n\r\n- in the first step 659&#39;876 is split into 65 and 9&#39;876\r\n  - recursion 1: 65 is split into 6 and 5\r\n  - recursion 2: 9&#39;876 is split into 98 and 76\r\n    - recursion 2.1: 98 is split into 9 and 7\r\n    - recursion 2.2: 76 is split into 7 and 6\r\n\r\n**Example using 16&#39;383**\r\n\r\nOne of your comments claims that 16&#39;383 cannot be handled using Math.round(), so lets take this as additional example.\r\n\r\nUsing the calculation with Math.floor():\r\n\r\n- in the first step 16&#39;383 is split into 1 and 6&#39;383\r\n  - recursion 1: 1 is appended to the StringBuilder\r\n  - recursion 2: 6&#39;383 is split into 63 and 84\r\n    - recursion 2.1: 63 is split into 6 and 3\r\n    - recursion 2.2: 83 - is a special case, needs additional work to split it into 8 and 3\r\n\r\n(the last recursive step that appends the single digit values to the StringBuilder has been mostly left out).\r\n\r\nUsing the calculation with Math.round():\r\n\r\n- in the first step 16&#39;383 is split into 163 and 83\r\n  - recursion 1: 163 is split into 16 and 3\r\n    - recursion 1.1: 16 is split into 1 and 6\r\n  - recursion 2: 83 is split into 8 and 3\r\n\r\nAs you can see even when using `Math.round()` its no problem to convert 16&#39;384 into a decimal string.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\r\nUsing `Math.floor()` doesn&#39;t work for all cases (i.e. requires additional logic to detect those cases and then needs to do additional work). IMHO this observation is enough to reject that approach.\r\n\r\nNote that you could &quot;fix&quot; the algorithm using `Math.floor()` by subtracting a small value from the `num_digits` intermediate result. But then, `Math.floor(xx-0.5)` gives for most values of xx the same result as `Math.round(xx-1.0)`.\r\n\r\nHooray, we found a way that we could use `Math.floor()` without needing a special case handling! :)\r\n\r\n**Additional note**\r\n\r\nThis calculation doesn&#39;t work for very small values of bitlength.\r\n\r\nIn the case of radix 10 it doesn&#39;t work for bitlength less than 4 - but bitlength values from 1 to 3 mean that the actual value in the `BigInteger` is in the range from 1 to 7 - and for so small values the algorithm doesn&#39;t make sense (because the result is confined to a single digit).","title":"Question about Java&#39;s BigInteger&#39;s toString","body":"<p><strong>What is the purpose of that code?</strong></p>\n<p>The purpose is to find a <code>BigInteger v</code> that has the form <code>radix^x</code> that divides the <code>BigInteger u</code> into two parts that have a string representation of roughly the same length.

For <code>num_digits</code> of 308.2547 this gives 7.</p>\n<p>Therefore in our example the code will pick <code>10^(2^7)</code> (which is 10^128) as divisor to split the original number.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why does it use <code>Math.round(x-1)</code> instead of <code>Math.floor(x)</code>?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Note that this example uses a very small <code>bitlength</code> just to prove the point. Effectively this calculation is never done with so small values</em></p>\n<p>It gives a better value for <code>n</code>.</p>\n<p>Take for example a bitlength of 14 (the <code>BigInteger</code> value is between 8192 and 16383).</p>\n<p>Using <code>Math.round(Math.log(b * LOG_TWO / logCache[radix]) / LOG_TWO - 1.0)</code> gives n=1, which means the code will choose <code>10^(2^1)</code> (which is 100) to split the <code>BigInteger</code>.</p>\n<p>Using <code>Math.floor(Math.log(b * LOG_TWO / logCache[radix]) / LOG_TWO)</code> gives n =2, which would mean that the code would choose <code>10^(2^2)</code> (which is 10000) to split the <code>BigInteger</code> - but for a <code>BigInteger</code> value of 8192 that would mean it would not split it at all.</p>\n<p><em>Using <code>Math.floor()</code> breaks down at several places:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>for the values 64 - 127 (bitlength = 7) using <code>Math.floor()</code> results in n=1 and u=100 and therefore cannot split values 64-99</li>\n<li>for the values 8'192 - 16'383 (bitlength = 14) using <code>Math.floor()</code> results in in=2 and u=10'000 and therefore cannot split values 8'192 - 9'999</li>\n<li>for the values 67'108'864 - 134'217'727 (bitlength = 27) using <code>Math.floor()</code> results in in=3 and u=100'000'000 and therefore cannot split values 67'108'864 - 99'999'999</li>\n<li>for the values 9'007'199'254'740'992 - 18'014'398'509'481'983 (bitlength = 54) using <code>Math.floor()</code> results in in=3 and u=10'000'000'000'000'000 and therefore cannot split values 9'007'199'254'740'992 - 9'999'999'999'999'999</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For those ranges (and there exist other ranges at larger bitlength values) you would need special handling after the split: if the upper part is BigInteger.ZERO then do some special handling. But any kind of special handling makes the algorithm more complex, more error prone and slower.</p>\n<p><em>For other ranges using <code>Math.floor()</code> doesn't really give better results than using <code>Math.round()</code>:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>for the values 16'384 - 99'999 (bitlengths from 15 to 17) using <code>Math.floor()</code> results in in=2 and u=10'000 and therefore the values are split into 1 digit and 4 digits.</p>\n<p>Using <code>Math.round()</code> for these values results in n=1 and u=100 and therefore the values are split into 3 digits and 2 digits which to me seems more equally split.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>for the values 100'000 - 262'143 (bitlengths from 17 to 18) using <code>Math.floor()</code> results in in=2 and u=10'000 and therefore the values are split into 2 digits and 4 digits.\nUsing <code>Math.round()</code> for these values results in n=1 and u=100 and therefore the values are split into 4 digits and 2 digits.</p>\n<p>For this range both approaches are on an equal level - either way you have a 4 digit number that you need to split further.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why is that special case handling such a problem</strong></p>\n<p>Lets try to convert the number 659'876 into a decimal string.</p>\n<p>Both approaches (using Math.floor() and using Math.round()) agree that we should use n=2 and u=10'000 in the first step.</p>\n<p>Using the calculation with Math.floor():</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in the first step 659'876 is split into 65 and 9'876\n<ul>\n<li>recursion 1: 65 - is a special case, needs additional work to split it into 6 and 5</li>\n<li>recursion 2: 9'876 - is a special case, needs additional work to split it into 98 and 76\n<ul>\n<li>recursion 2.1: 98 - is a special case, needs additional work to split it into 9 and 7</li>\n<li>recursion 2.2: 76 - is a special case, needs additional work to split it into 7 and 6</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(the last recursive step that appends the single digit values to the StringBuilder has been left out).</p>\n<p>Using the calculation with Math.round():</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in the first step 659'876 is split into 65 and 9'876\n<ul>\n<li>recursion 1: 65 is split into 6 and 5</li>\n<li>recursion 2: 9'876 is split into 98 and 76\n<ul>\n<li>recursion 2.1: 98 is split into 9 and 7</li>\n<li>recursion 2.2: 76 is split into 7 and 6</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example using 16'383</strong></p>\n<p>One of your comments claims that 16'383 cannot be handled using Math.round(), so lets take this as additional example.</p>\n<p>Using the calculation with Math.floor():</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in the first step 16'383 is split into 1 and 6'383\n<ul>\n<li>recursion 1: 1 is appended to the StringBuilder</li>\n<li>recursion 2: 6'383 is split into 63 and 84\n<ul>\n<li>recursion 2.1: 63 is split into 6 and 3</li>\n<li>recursion 2.2: 83 - is a special case, needs additional work to split it into 8 and 3</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(the last recursive step that appends the single digit values to the StringBuilder has been mostly left out).</p>\n<p>Using the calculation with Math.round():</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in the first step 16'383 is split into 163 and 83\n<ul>\n<li>recursion 1: 163 is split into 16 and 3\n<ul>\n<li>recursion 1.1: 16 is split into 1 and 6</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>recursion 2: 83 is split into 8 and 3</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see even when using <code>Math.round()</code> its no problem to convert 16'384 into a decimal string.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Using <code>Math.floor()</code> doesn't work for all cases (i.e. requires additional logic to detect those cases and then needs to do additional work).

Then, since all controllers and other repositories are in sub-packages, they will be discovered by the framework. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Option 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>Use <code>@ComponentScan</code> annotation with <code>basePackages</code> argument, along with the <code>@SpringBootApplication</code> in your <code>Application</code> class like below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>@SpringBootApplication\n@ComponentScan(basePackages=\"com.nomad.dubbed\")\npublic class Application  {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args){\n        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":17836587,"reputation":171,"user_id":12955452,"display_name":"Ankita Chaturvedi"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":12,"is_accepted":false,"score":12,"last_activity_date":1628764522,"creation_date":1585510660,"answer_id":60919761,"question_id":37011790,"body_markdown":"We should not use `@ComponentScan` annotation with `@SpringBootApplication`, as that&#39;s not the right practice. \r\n`@SpringBootApplication` is a combination of 3 annotations: `@ComponentScan`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration` and `@Configuration`. \r\n\r\nMain class which has the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation should be in parent/super package.\r\n\r\n*e.g.* - `com.spring.learning` is a parent package and its children are \r\n`com.spring.learning.controller`, `com.spring.learning.service`, `com.spring.learning.pojo`\r\n\r\nHence it scans its package and sub packages.\r\n\r\nThis is the best practice – project layout or structure is a prominent concept in Spring Boot.","title":"Rest Controller not recognizing GET request in Spring Boot App","body":"<p>We should not use <code>@ComponentScan</code> annotation with <code>@SpringBootApplication</code>, as that's not the right practice.\n<code>@SpringBootApplication</code> is a combination of 3 annotations: <code>@ComponentScan</code>, <code>@EnableAutoConfiguration</code> and <code>@Configuration</code>.</p>\n<p>Main class which has the <code>@SpringBootApplication</code> annotation should be in parent/super package.</p>\n<p><em>e.g.</em> - <code>com.spring.learning</code> is a parent package and its children are\n<code>com.spring.learning.controller</code>, <code>com.spring.learning.service</code>, <code>com.spring.learning.pojo</code></p>\n<p>Hence it scans its package and sub packages.</p>\n<p>This is the best practice – project layout or structure is a prominent concept in Spring Boot.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":7757866,"reputation":1,"user_id":5871541,"display_name":"Aks00747"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1586534464,"creation_date":1586532639,"answer_id":61143545,"question_id":37011790,"body_markdown":"actually springboots scans all of its components under you core package like example:\r\n\r\npackage com.nomad.dubbed.app;\r\n\r\nif you add controllers, services, dao packages under com.nomad.dubbed.app.controllers, com.nomad.dubbed.app.services, com.nomad.dubbed.app.dao.\r\n\r\nthen you can easily run your rest controller, but if you add all packages parallel to your core springboot package like com.nomad.dubbed.controllers, com.nomad.dubbed.services.\r\n\r\nthen you need to scan for @ComponentScan({&quot;com.nomad.dubbed.controllers&quot;,&quot;com.nomad.dubbed.services&quot;})\r\n\r\nif you choose to go for componentscan then you have to also scan for springboot application package as well.\r\n\r\nso best way is create all the packages under spring boot application dubbed.app.xyz...\r\n","title":"Rest Controller not recognizing GET request in Spring Boot App","body":"<p>actually springboots scans all of its components under you core package like example:</p>\n\n<p>package com.nomad.dubbed.app;</p>\n\n<p>if you add controllers, services, dao packages under com.nomad.dubbed.app.controllers, com.nomad.dubbed.app.services, com.nomad.dubbed.app.dao.</p>\n\n<p>then you can easily run your rest controller, but if you add all packages parallel to your core springboot package like com.nomad.dubbed.controllers, com.nomad.dubbed.services.</p>\n\n<p>then you need to scan for @ComponentScan({\"com.nomad.dubbed.controllers\",\"com.nomad.dubbed.services\"})</p>\n\n<p>if you choose to go for componentscan then you have to also scan for springboot application package as well.</p>\n\n<p>so best way is create all the packages under spring boot application dubbed.app.xyz...</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3747502,"reputation":21,"user_id":3115835,"display_name":"BAGEERADHA"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1588956004,"creation_date":1588956004,"answer_id":61683803,"question_id":37011790,"body_markdown":"please check that the your controller classes are in sub packages.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the main class is **com.myapp** package, then controller class is either in the same package or is in sub package like **com.myapp.controllers**.

In the sense that the runtime (`java.exe`) has no idea what they are - most of the generics doesn&#39;t survive compilation in the first place (&#39;erasure&#39;).\r\n\r\nSo, that it gets &#39;converted&#39; to something else at compile time is irrelevant. Generics are __entirely__ about having the compiler check your work. It does nothing at runtime.\r\n\r\nSo what _does_ it do? It links things. It tells the compiler: There is some type, we don&#39;t know what it is, but in these places (more than one place, it&#39;s not useful to link one thing to nothing else), it&#39;s the same type, whatever it is. Any &#39;usage&#39; of this situation gets to redefine whatever type it is, so long as they maintain the &#39;linkage&#39;.\r\n\r\nFor example, trivially, imagine this method:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic Object print(Object o) {\r\n  System.out.println(o);\r\n  return o;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA simple-ish method that you can use to on-the-fly print things while you use them. For example, you may want to lowercase incoming usernames to check them against a (case insensitive) table of usernames like so: `users.get(username.toLowerCase())`, but perhaps you want to see the original, as-entered, username on the fly, so you could instead do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nusers.get(print(username).toLowerCase());\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut that would not work! The return type of the `print` method is `Object`, and `Object` _does not have a `.toLowerCase()` method_.\r\n\r\nYes, you have eyes. So have I: We can clearly see the object returned by `print` is clearly a string so it should work, but it does not. This is not a javac oversight - this is intentional behaviour: You are free to _change the body of a method later_. There is a difference between what you _declare to be the truth_ about your API and what so happens to occur this particular version. `public Object print(Object o)` _declares_ that you will today and forever (or at least, until you say your API is no longer backwards compatible), take 1 argument, that can be any object, and this method returns something. What? Dunno, but, it&#39;s at least an Object (not particularly useful, that).\r\n\r\n__Today__ it returns what you passed to it. But tomorrow? Who knows.\r\n\r\nSo let&#39;s fix this and make it work again. Add generics. We are going to _link_ the type of the parameter with the return type:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic &lt;T&gt; T print(T object) {\r\n  System.out.println(object);\r\n  return object;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now `maps.get(print(username).toLowerCase())` does work! Great!\r\n\r\nThe reason it works is simply because you linked the types: You&#39;ve told the compiler: Hey, this print method? Each time it is invoked, there is some type. No restrictions on it (well, it has to be Object or some subtype thereof, so not a primitive, other than that - anything goes). Both the return type and the param type are that type. Whatever type is most convenient at the time. So, given that rule - the compiler picks `String` to be that type and now the code works, great.\r\n\r\nThis is __entirely the compiler doing it__. If you decompile the bytecode, you&#39;ll notice the print method is just `public Object print(Object object)`, and instead it is the _caller_ that changed a bit - decompiling the `users.get(print(username).toLowerCase())` line you notice that the compiler has injected a __cast__ of all things, even though the java line doesn&#39;t contain a cast. That&#39;s because __the compiler__ realised it was safe to do this, _because_ of the generics.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to your code. You write it like the first snippet (with the T), so that this works:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Highrise extends Building {}\r\n\r\nHighrise[] highrises = ....;\r\nList&lt;Highrise&gt; asList = fromArrayToList(highrises);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHad you gone with the 3rd snippet in your code, that would not work. In fact, the third snippet is __broken__. After all, I could call this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nList&lt;Building&gt; highrises = ...;\r\nhighrises.add(new LogCabin());\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter all, a LogCabin is a building. Given that I can trivially write:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBuilding b = new LogCabin();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be bizarre indeed if `highrises.add(new LogCabin())` would fail if highrises is a `List&lt;Building&gt;`. But.. you just added a logcabin to a list of highrises, you broke it.\r\n\r\nA second thing to realize with generics is __variance__. Given a list of X, that cannot just be treated as a list of Y, where Y is a supertype. This makes total sense:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBuilding b = new LogCabin(); // fine\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this does not work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nList&lt;Building&gt; b = new ArrayList&lt;LogCabin&gt;(); // fails at compile time\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhy? Well, because you can invoke `b.add(new Highrise())` and now there&#39;s a highrise in your list of logcabins:\r\n\r\n```\r\nList&lt;LogCabin&gt; logCabins = new ArrayList&lt;LogCabin&gt;();\r\nList&lt;Building&gt; buildings = logCabins;\r\nbuildings.add(new Highrise());\r\nLogCabin lc = logCabins.get(0);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code proves why invariance is neccessary. `? extends` lets you opt into covariance, but, to counter the above problem, you can&#39;t call `.add` on a `List&lt;? extends&gt;` anything. Even just `List&lt;?&gt;` (which is short for `List&lt;? extends Object&gt;`. (Well, to get pedantic, you can call `.add(null)` - a literal `null` literal, because a `null` literal is all reference types at once, but that is quite useless, generally).\r\n\r\nBy disabling &#39;add&#39;, it now no longer matters. The problem with letting you assign a list of logcabins to a list of buildings is that this means one could add non-logcabin building to the list, but if `add` doesn&#39;t work _at all_, it no longer matters. Hence:\r\n\r\n```\r\nList&lt;LogCabin&gt; logCabins = new ArrayList&lt;LogCabin&gt;(); // fine\r\nList&lt;? extends Building&gt; buildings = logCabin; // compiles fine\r\nbuildings.add(new Highrise()); // compiler error\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you know why `extends` is useful.\r\n\r\nGenerics is best understood by keeping two things in mind:\r\n\r\n* Type variables are named that way for a good reason: There is a TYPE, but you do not know what it is. Just like `int x;` says &quot;there is an integer, no idea if it&#39;s 0, 1, 5, 1238123, who knows? It has a specific file for any specific invocation, but it could be different every next invocation&quot; - `&lt;T&gt;` says there is some type, who knows what it is.\r\n* They LINK things. If they don&#39;t link things, it&#39;s useless or a language hack. A type var must be used in at least 2 places.\r\n\r\nExample of 2 place usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass ArrayList&lt;T&gt; { // first use\r\n  void add(T elem) { ... } // also here\r\n  T get(int idx) { ... } // and here\r\n  void addAll(List&lt;? extends T&gt; elems) {} // and here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nat least 4 places where T is used, that&#39;s fine. Linkage achieved.\r\n","title":"Java generics with extends keyword in method","body":"<p>Generics are almost entirely compiler-checked documentation.
