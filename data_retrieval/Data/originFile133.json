In particular, it relies far too much on inheritance. I recommend reading *Effective Java* and redesigning this in a more robust way.

There is no need to use inheritance to control creation of objects; use some kind of creational pattern (abstract factory, for example) instead. \r\n\r\nIf you need an immediate hack, simply removing the inline initialization of `temperatureChart` and `series` might fix the immediate issue; however the design problems will inevitably lead to more issues arising at a later stage.

Something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Hashtable env = new Hashtable();\nenv.put(DirContext.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, &quot;com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory&quot;);\nenv.put(DirContext.PROVIDER_URL, url );\nenv.put(DirContext.SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION, &quot;simple&quot;);\nenv.put(DirContext.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL, principal);\nenv.put(DirContext.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, credentials);\nenv.put(&quot;java.naming.ldap.factory.socket&quot;, &quot;MySSLSocketFactory&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, if the property &quot;java.naming.ldap.factory.socket&quot; is set at JVM level, I believe each applicaton will overwrite the current SSL Factory.

There are obviously flaws in my interpretation of the algorithm, suggestions on how to fix it are welcome but the primary problem is receiving user input that is too large for an integer variable but I also want to avoid the decimals of the double value. \r\n\r\nI already tried to use the `BigDecimal` and `BigNumber` but I simply don&#39;t have enough experience to be able to understand them completely.

I have a file <code>commons-logging.properties</code> in my <code>src/test/resources</code> folder with the following contents</p>\n<pre><code>org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory=org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Log4jFactory\nlog4j.configuration=log4j.properties\n</code></pre>\n<p>and a file log4j.properties in the same folder with the following contents</p>\n<pre><code>log4j.rootLogger=ERROR, stdout\nlog4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\nlog4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\nlog4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%5p [%c] %m%n\n\n#This is the line that should make httpclient shut up\nlog4j.logger.org.apache.http=ERROR\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, when I run my tests I still get a bunch of output like this:</p>\n<pre><code>21:57:41.413 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;                                   [\\r][\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.413 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\r][\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.413 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;                                   [\\r][\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.413 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;                               &lt;/ul&gt;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.413 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;    [\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.424 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.425 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\r][\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.425 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\r][\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.425 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;                   &lt;/div&gt;[\\r][\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.425 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;                &lt;/li&gt;[\\r][\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.425 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;            [\\r][\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.425 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;            [\\r][\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.433 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;        &lt;/ul&gt;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.433 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/div&gt;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.433 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.433 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/div&gt;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.433 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.433 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.433 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.433 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.433 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;div class=&quot;details&quot;&gt;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.442 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.443 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.443 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;div class=&quot;details-body details-precis  &quot;&gt;[\\n]\n&quot;\n21:57:41.443 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;div class=&quot;details-state&quot;&gt;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.443 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.443 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/div&gt;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.443 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/div&gt;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.443 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.455 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.455 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/div&gt;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.455 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.455 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/div&gt;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.455 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/div&gt;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.455 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.455 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.455 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\n]&quot;\n21:57:41.455 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\r][\\n]&quot;\nDestroying 1 processes21:57:41.465 [main] DEBUG org.apache.http.wire - &lt;&lt; &quot;[\\r][\\n]&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This output for everything that comes across the wire is making this library unusable for me...that is until I can figure out how to turn it off.

But here is some alternate syntax, and use of correct date-time type. And we see the new `SequencedCollection` features in Java 21+. \r\n\r\n# tl;dr\r\n\r\nDefine your class as a record that implements `Comparable`. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nrecord CarSale( String name , Instant whenSold ) implements Comparable &lt; CarSale &gt;\r\n{\r\n    private static final Comparator &lt; CarSale &gt; COMPARATOR =\r\n            Comparator\r\n                    .comparing ( CarSale :: whenSold )\r\n                    .thenComparing ( CarSale :: name );\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int compareTo ( final CarSale other )\r\n    {\r\n        return CarSale.COMPARATOR.compare ( this , other );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefine your resulting sorted collection as a `SequencedCollection` whose implementation is a `TreeSet`. Get the latest car sale by getting the last element of the collection. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nCarSale latest =\r\n        new TreeSet &lt;&gt; (\r\n                List\r\n                        .of (\r\n                                new CarSale ( &quot;BMW&quot; , Instant.parse ( &quot;2023-01-01T02:00:00.800Z&quot; ) ) ,\r\n                                new CarSale ( &quot;Benz&quot; , Instant.parse ( &quot;2023-01-03T02:00:00.800Z&quot; ) ) ,\r\n                                new CarSale ( &quot;Jeep&quot; , Instant.parse ( &quot;2023-01-02T02:00:00.800Z&quot; ) )\r\n                        )\r\n        )\r\n                .getLast ( );  // Java 21+. \r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt;CarSale[name=Benz, whenSold=2023-01-03T02:00:00.800Z]\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n\r\n## Naming\r\n\r\nYour names are a bit vague. The `sold` could be more clear such as `whenSold`. And `Car` class is really about when a car was sold. So `CarSale` would be more precise.\r\n\r\n## Record\r\n\r\nIf the main purpose of your `Car` class is to transparently communicate shallowly-immutable data, define your class as a [record][1]. The compiler implicitly creates the constructor, getters, `equals` &amp; `hashCode`, and `toString`. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nrecord CarSale ( String name , String whenSold ) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## `java.time.Instant`\r\n\r\nThat second parameter, `whenSold`, represents a moment, a point on the timeline. Java includes the *java.time* classes for such date-time work. Use [`java.time.Instant`][2] to represent a point on the timeline as seen in UTC (an offset from UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds). \r\n\r\n```java\r\nrecord CarSale ( String name , Instant whenSold ) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour input strings use standard ISO 8601 format to represent that moment. The *java.time* classes by default use ISO 8601 formats when parsing/generating text. So we can directly parse your inputs.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nCarSale car = new CarSale ( &quot;BMW&quot; , Instant.parse( &quot;2023-01-01T02:00:00.800Z&quot; ) ) ;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## `List.of`\r\n\r\nYou can collect your instantiated `CarSale` objects more compactly with [List.of][3].  This produces an [unmodifiable `List`][4] object.\r\n\r\nYour example data is already in the desired sort order. So I changed your original order so we can verify sorting is happening.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList &lt; CarSale &gt; carSales =\r\n        List.of (\r\n                new CarSale ( &quot;BMW&quot; , Instant.parse ( &quot;2023-01-01T02:00:00.800Z&quot; ) ) ,\r\n                new CarSale ( &quot;Benz&quot; , Instant.parse ( &quot;2023-01-03T02:00:00.800Z&quot; ) ),\r\n                new CarSale ( &quot;Jeep&quot; , Instant.parse ( &quot;2023-01-02T02:00:00.800Z&quot; ) ) \r\n        );\r\n```\r\n\r\n## `Comparable`\r\n\r\nOther Answers apply a [`Comparator`][5]. That is a valid approach. But if your primary default way to sort these `CarSale` records is by `whenSold`, then build that into your class as a feature. To build that in, implement the [`Comparable`][6] interface with its `compareTo` method. \r\n\r\nTo implement `compareTo`, we can define a contained `Comparator` to do the work. Make it `static` to have a [singleton][7] [constant][8].\r\n\r\nWhen sorting on `whenSold`, we could have a tie when two or more cars are sold at the same moment. To break the tie, we can look at the only other property, `name`. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate static final Comparator &lt; CarSale &gt; COMPARATOR =\r\n        Comparator\r\n                .comparing ( CarSale :: whenSold )\r\n                .thenComparing ( CarSale :: name );\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinish the `compareTo` method.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic int compareTo ( final CarSale other )\r\n{\r\n    return CarSale.COMPARATOR.compare ( this , other );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Sorting\r\n\r\nFinally, we get to the sorting. \r\n\r\nWe have an unmodifiable list, which cannot be sorted. So we need to create a modifiable collection that can be sorted. We can do that by passing the unmodifiable list to the constructor of a modifiable `List` implementation. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nnew ArrayList &lt;&gt; ( carSales )\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `Stream` sorting\r\n\r\nFrom there we can sort by making a stream, asking the stream to sort itself using the &quot;natural order&quot; of our `CarSale` objects. The natural order is the order determined by its being `Comparable`. We collect the resulting sorted elements into another `List`.\r\n\r\n    List &lt; CarSale &gt; carSalesSorted = new ArrayList &lt;&gt; ( carSales ).stream ( ).sorted ( ).toList ( );\r\n\r\n### `SequencedCollection`\r\n\r\nIn Java 21, we can use the more general interface [`SequencedCollection`][9] rather than `List`. See [*JEP 431: Sequenced Collections*](https://openjdk.org/jeps/431).\r\n\r\n    SequencedCollection &lt; CarSale &gt; carSalesSorted = new ArrayList &lt;&gt; ( carSales ).stream ( ).sorted ( ).toList ( );\r\n\r\n### `TreeSet` in place of `ArrayList`\r\n\r\nAt this point, we realize that we can use a different implementation of [`SequencedCollection`][9]. We can use [`TreeSet`][10] which automatically keeps its elements in sorted order. This works only if we do not care about tracking duplicate objects, as [`Set`][11] implementations like `TreeSet` forbid duplicates. We can simply pass our unmodifiable `List` to the [constructor of `TreeSet`][12]. \r\n\r\n    SequencedCollection &lt; CarSale &gt; carSalesSorted = new TreeSet &lt;&gt; ( carSales );\r\n\r\nTo access the elements, iterate.

The <code>sold</code> could be more clear such as <code>whenSold</code>. And <code>Car</code> class is really about when a car was sold. So <code>CarSale</code> would be more precise.</p>\n<h2>Record</h2>\n<p>If the main purpose of your <code>Car</code> class is to transparently communicate shallowly-immutable data, define your class as a <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/395\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">record</a>. The compiler implicitly creates the constructor, getters, <code>equals</code> &amp; <code>hashCode</code>, and <code>toString</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>record CarSale ( String name , String whenSold ) {}\n</code></pre>\n<h2><code>java.time.Instant</code></h2>\n<p>That second parameter, <code>whenSold</code>, represents a moment, a point on the timeline. Java includes the <em>java.time</em> classes for such date-time work. Use <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Instant.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>java.time.Instant</code></a> to represent a point on the timeline as seen in UTC (an offset from UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds).</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>record CarSale ( String name , Instant whenSold ) {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Your input strings use standard ISO 8601 format to represent that moment. The <em>java.time</em> classes by default use ISO 8601 formats when parsing/generating text. So we can directly parse your inputs.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>CarSale car = new CarSale ( &quot;BMW&quot; , Instant.parse( &quot;2023-01-01T02:00:00.800Z&quot; ) ) ;\n</code></pre>\n<h2><code>List.of</code></h2>\n<p>You can collect your instantiated <code>CarSale</code> objects more compactly with <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html#of(E,E,E)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">List.of</a>.  This produces an <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html#unmodifiable\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">unmodifiable <code>List</code></a> object.</p>\n<p>Your example data is already in the desired sort order. So I changed your original order so we can verify sorting is happening.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>List &lt; CarSale &gt; carSales =\n        List.of (\n                new CarSale ( &quot;BMW&quot; , Instant.parse ( &quot;2023-01-01T02:00:00.800Z&quot; ) ) ,\n                new CarSale ( &quot;Benz&quot; , Instant.parse ( &quot;2023-01-03T02:00:00.800Z&quot; ) ),\n                new CarSale ( &quot;Jeep&quot; , Instant.parse ( &quot;2023-01-02T02:00:00.800Z&quot; ) ) \n        );\n</code></pre>\n<h2><code>Comparable</code></h2>\n<p>Other Answers apply a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Comparator.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Comparator</code></a>. That is a valid approach. But if your primary default way to sort these <code>CarSale</code> records is by <code>whenSold</code>, then build that into your class as a feature. To build that in, implement the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Comparable.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Comparable</code></a> interface with its <code>compareTo</code> method.</p>\n<p>To implement <code>compareTo</code>, we can define a contained <code>Comparator</code> to do the work.

To break the tie, we can look at the only other property, <code>name</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>private static final Comparator &lt; CarSale &gt; COMPARATOR =\n        Comparator\n                .comparing ( CarSale :: whenSold )\n                .thenComparing ( CarSale :: name );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finish the <code>compareTo</code> method.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Override\npublic int compareTo ( final CarSale other )\n{\n    return CarSale.COMPARATOR.compare ( this , other );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Sorting</h2>\n<p>Finally, we get to the sorting.</p>\n<p>We have an unmodifiable list, which cannot be sorted. So we need to create a modifiable collection that can be sorted. We can do that by passing the unmodifiable list to the constructor of a modifiable <code>List</code> implementation.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>new ArrayList &lt;&gt; ( carSales )\n</code></pre>\n<h3><code>Stream</code> sorting</h3>\n<p>From there we can sort by making a stream, asking the stream to sort itself using the &quot;natural order&quot; of our <code>CarSale</code> objects. The natural order is the order determined by its being <code>Comparable</code>. We collect the resulting sorted elements into another <code>List</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>List &lt; CarSale &gt; carSalesSorted = new ArrayList &lt;&gt; ( carSales ).stream ( ).sorted ( ).toList ( );\n</code></pre>\n<h3><code>SequencedCollection</code></h3>\n<p>In Java 21, we can use the more general interface <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/SequencedCollection.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>SequencedCollection</code></a> rather than <code>List</code>.

We can use <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/TreeSet.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>TreeSet</code></a> which automatically keeps its elements in sorted order. This works only if we do not care about tracking duplicate objects, as <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Set.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Set</code></a> implementations like <code>TreeSet</code> forbid duplicates. We can simply pass our unmodifiable <code>List</code> to the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/TreeSet.html#%3Cinit%3E(java.util.Collection)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">constructor of <code>TreeSet</code></a>.</p>\n<pre><code>SequencedCollection &lt; CarSale &gt; carSalesSorted = new TreeSet &lt;&gt; ( carSales );\n</code></pre>\n<p>To access the elements, iterate.

Remove these lines: each `public void guess ();`, `public void correct (guess) {`. Also, be sure the `{` and `}` are  properly paired and nested. Bear in  mind that you cannot code one method inside another. This example is correct:\r\n````\r\n     public static void main (String [] args) { \r\n       // code for main\r\n     } // end of main\r\n   \r\n     public static int foo (int arg) { \r\n       // code for foo\r\n     } // end of foo\r\n\r\n     public static boolean bar (String bat) { \r\n        // code for bar\r\n     }  // end of bar\r\n````\r\nBut, this is incorrect:\r\n````\r\n    public void static main (String [] args) { \r\n      // some code for main\r\n      public static int foo (int value) { \r\n         // some code for foo\r\n      } // end of foo\r\n    }  // end of main\r\n````\r\nIn addition, if you have a method that has a non-void return type, the code in the method must return a value of the specified type, via any execution path in that method.  For example, if you have an `int` return type, the code must have a `return` statement with an `int` expression. The expression may be a constant. For an `int` return type method, the following are valid:\r\n\r\n - `return 3;`\r\n - `return arg * arg + 7;`\r\n - `return foo;`\r\n\r\nWhen you get a clean compile, run your code. With at least one question, give no correct answer.\r\n\r\nI suspect that, having done that, you don&#39;t need much more help\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s continue with a design tip. This part is optional. You have repeated code. It might be that your teacher, at this point, wants you to have repeated code, because the next lesson will be about how to avoid repeated code.\r\n\r\nWhen you want to have code that repeats, consider using some combination of the following:\r\n\r\n - Looping\r\n - An array or [Collection](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collection.html), such as an [ArrayList](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html)\r\n - Additional methods.\r\n - Additional `class` definitions.\r\n\r\nSince you are new to Java, I assume `Collection` Objects will be in a future lesson.\r\n\r\nYour code has several pairs, with each pair has one question and one answer. One way to pair a question with an answer is to use a new `class`:\r\n\r\n````\r\npublic class QuizEntry { \r\n    private String question;\r\n    private String answer;\r\n   \r\n    public QuizEntry (String question, String answer) {\r\n        this.question = question;\r\n        this.answer = answer;\r\n    } \r\n    public String getQuestion () { return question; }\r\n    public String getAnswer () { return answer; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n````\r\nWith that, you could have an array of `QuizEntry`:\r\n\r\n````\r\n   QuizItem [] theQuiz = { \r\n        new QuizItem (&quot;What types of animal(s) can&#39;t vomit?&quot;,&quot;rodents&quot;)\r\n      , new QuizItem (&quot;What is the only mammal capable of flight?&quot;,&quot;bats&quot;) \r\n      // etc. \r\n      }; \r\n````\r\n\r\nIf the items making a pair are of the same type, an alternative is to  use a 2D array:\r\n````\r\n    String [][] theQuiz = {\r\n              {&quot;What types of animal(s) can&#39;t vomit?&quot;,&quot;rodents&quot;}\r\n             ,{&quot;What is the only mammal capable of flight?&quot;, &quot;bats&quot;}\r\n        // etc.\r\n    }; \r\n````\r\nNow, you can have a loop to run your quiz. But, before we get to that, there is a conflict in getting and handling the answers. In your code, taking one question as an example, you have this:\r\n\r\n````   \r\n    System.out.println(&quot;What is the only mammal capable of flight?&quot;);\r\n    String input = scan.nextLine(); //get input\r\n    String answer = &quot;Bats&quot;;\r\n````\r\nIn the above, the question is displayed, the  user&#39;s answer is retrieved and awaits processing.  Processing is  presumably to be handled by the `public static boolean guess (String answer, Scanner input)` method. The problem  is that method also gets the answer from the user. That means the user has to enter an answer twice before the answer is evaluated. The first response is ignored. The second is processed. If the second user response is incorrect, a third response will be processed. \r\n\r\nNow, back to the loop:\r\n\r\n````\r\n    // 1D array with class QuizEntry version\r\n    int correct = 0;\r\n    for  (int question = 0; question &lt; theQuiz.length; question++) { \r\n      System.out.println (theQuiz[question].getQuestion ());\r\n      *******  guess (theQuiz[question].getAnswer (), scan);\r\n      *******\r\n    }\r\n````\r\n````\r\n   // 2D array version\r\n   int correct = 0;\r\n   for (int question = 0; question &lt; theQuiz.length; question++) { \r\n      System.out.println (theQuiz[question][0]);\r\n      ******* guess (theQuiz[question][1], scan);\r\n      *******\r\n   }\r\n````\r\n\r\nNow, update your code and run it. Don&#39;t worry about finishing the part that counts correct answers. Oh, and remove the `*******`. It won&#39;t compile with them. Doing this reflects the &quot;code a little, test a little&quot; practice. If you  have not already found and fixed it, you might find there is still a bug in  the `guess` method. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, where I have the `*******`, you should make more changes. \r\n\r\nA method with an `int` return type will return an `int`, and can be used where an `int` expression can be used. If `bin`, `bar`,  `bat` are each a method taking an `int` and returning an `int`, you cold have statements like these: \r\n - `int foo = bar (3) * bin (k) + bat (7);` \r\n - `int frob = bar (3) * m + (bat (bin (8));`\r\n\r\nA method returning a `boolean` can be used where a `boolean` expression can be used:\r\n````\r\n     public static boolean isEnglishLetter (char x) { \r\n        return (x &gt;= &#39;a&#39; &amp;&amp; x &lt;= &#39;z&#39;) || (x &gt;= &#39;A&#39; &amp;&amp; x &lt;= &#39;Z&#39;);\r\n     }\r\n````\r\nYou can use it in an `if`:\r\n````\r\n     char choice = scan.next ().charAt(0);\r\n     if (isEnglishLetter (choice)) { ... }\r\n````\r\nYou can assign it to another `boolean`:\r\n```` \r\n     boolean goodAnswer = isEnglishLetter (choice);\r\n````\r\nSo, you use the result returned by the `uess` method to update the value of `correct` or not update it.

If the second user response is incorrect, a third response will be processed.</p>\n<p>Now, back to the loop:</p>\n<pre><code>    // 1D array with class QuizEntry version\n    int correct = 0;\n    for  (int question = 0; question &lt; theQuiz.length; question++) { \n      System.out.println (theQuiz[question].getQuestion ());\n      *******  guess (theQuiz[question].getAnswer (), scan);\n      *******\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>   // 2D array version\n   int correct = 0;\n   for (int question = 0; question &lt; theQuiz.length; question++) { \n      System.out.println (theQuiz[question][0]);\n      ******* guess (theQuiz[question][1], scan);\n      *******\n   }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, update your code and run it. Don't worry about finishing the part that counts correct answers. Oh, and remove the <code>*******</code>. It won't compile with them. Doing this reflects the &quot;code a little, test a little&quot; practice. If you  have not already found and fixed it, you might find there is still a bug in  the <code>guess</code> method.</p>\n<p>Now, where I have the <code>*******</code>, you should make more changes.</p>\n<p>A method with an <code>int</code> return type will return an <code>int</code>, and can be used where an <code>int</code> expression can be used. If <code>bin</code>, <code>bar</code>,  <code>bat</code> are each a method taking an <code>int</code> and returning an <code>int</code>, you cold have statements like these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>int foo = bar (3) * bin (k) + bat (7);</code></li>\n<li><code>int frob = bar (3) * m + (bat (bin (8));</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A method returning a <code>boolean</code> can be used where a <code>boolean</code> expression can be used:</p>\n<pre><code>     public static boolean isEnglishLetter (char x) { \n        return (x &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; x &lt;= 'z') || (x &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; x &lt;= 'Z');\n     }\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can use it in an <code>if</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>     char choice = scan.next ().charAt(0);\n     if (isEnglishLetter (choice)) { ... }\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can assign it to another <code>boolean</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>     boolean goodAnswer = isEnglishLetter (choice);\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, you use the result returned by the <code>uess</code> method to update the value of <code>correct</code> or not update it.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":23740623,"reputation":1,"user_id":17758716,"display_name":"Reilas"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1696967866,"creation_date":1696967866,"answer_id":77268648,"question_id":77267481,"body_markdown":"&gt; _&quot;...

It is generated separately using the default `SecureRandom` implementation. As it is 12 bytes in size (the default for GCM) then you have 96 bits of randomness. The chance that the counter repeats is abysmally small.

If it is smaller it simply consists of the leftmost bytes of the authentication tag though. You can specify another size of tag using [`GCMParameterSpec`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/crypto/spec/GCMParameterSpec.html) as third parameter for your `init` call.\r\n\r\nNote that the strength of GCM is strongly dependent on the size of the tag.

Your classes should each have a single responsibility, and should only contain fields and methods related to that responsibility. If you have a class called `MyCircle`, each instance of that class represents a single circle. &quot;Which circle is selected&quot; is not part of the responsibility of that class (it is part of the broader application). In fact, you are implementing a business rule (that perhaps you haven&#39;t actually verbalized), that no more than one circle can be selected at once. It certainly is not the responsibility of `MyCircle` (which again, just represents a single circle) to implement that rule (or to keep track of which of the many circles is selected).\r\n\r\n    On the other hand, &quot;is this circle selected&quot; probably is a responsibility of the `MyCircle` class. So some kind of boolean `selected` property might well be appropriate here. It&#39;s not too hard to see how to change such a property in response to a mouse click.\r\n\r\n    This is actually the reason you&#39;re having trouble implementing this; you&#39;re trying to maintain the state of &quot;which circle is selected&quot; in *every* circle instance.\r\n\r\n2. Favor composition over inheritance. This is one of the key items in Joshua Bloch&#39;s book *Effective Java* (which every Java Programmer should read). My particular rule of thumb is that if you are not adding functionality to a class, but are just providing a convenient way to configure instances of it, you should not subclass it. Even if you are adding some functionality (and in your case you can argue you are: you are adding the notion of selection), you might favor composition.\r\n\r\n    Inheriting from a class means you have access to more of the inner workings of that class, and consequently you have more responsibility in terms of understanding how the class works in order not to write code which might not work the way you want. (&quot;Inheritance violates encapsulation&quot;, to quote Bloch.) The more complex a class is (and UI classes are *very* complex), the more wary you should be of subclassing them. I would not recommend subclassing `Circle` here.\r\n\r\nThe first point creates a potential problem: we do need somewhere to track which circle is selected. If each circle only knows when it is selected, we need to know when any of the `selected` values (one for each circle) changes. JavaFX provides a mechanism for doing this via [JavaFX Properties](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/properties-binding-tutorial/binding.htm). These are basically &quot;observable&quot; properties: meaning we can *register a listener* with them and the listener is invoked if the property value changes.\r\n\r\nSo I would do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport javafx.beans.property.BooleanProperty;\r\nimport javafx.beans.property.SimpleBooleanProperty;\r\nimport javafx.scene.input.KeyEvent;\r\nimport javafx.scene.input.MouseEvent;\r\nimport javafx.scene.paint.Color;\r\nimport javafx.scene.shape.Circle;\r\n\r\npublic class SelectableCircle {\r\n    double xOffset = 0;\r\n    double yOffset = 0;\r\n\r\n    private final Circle uiComponent;\r\n\r\n    private final BooleanProperty selected = new SimpleBooleanProperty(false);\r\n\r\n    public BooleanProperty selectedProperty() {\r\n        return selected;\r\n    }\r\n    public final boolean isSelected() {\r\n        return selectedProperty().get();\r\n    }\r\n    public final void setSelected(boolean selected) {\r\n        selectedProperty().set(selected);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public SelectableCircle(int xPos, int yPos, double radius, Color color){\r\n        uiComponent = new Circle(xPos, yPos, radius, color);\r\n\r\n        uiComponent.setOnMouseClicked(e -&gt; {\r\n            setSelected( ! isSelected() );\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        uiComponent.setOnKeyPressed((KeyEvent event) -&gt;{\r\n            //Handle circle movement\r\n            handleCircleMovement(event);\r\n        });\r\n        uiComponent.setOnMousePressed((MouseEvent event) -&gt;{\r\n            //Handle drag start\r\n            handleCircleDragStart(event);\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        uiComponent.setOnMouseDragged((MouseEvent event) -&gt;{\r\n            //Handle drag\r\n            handleCircleDrag(event);\r\n        });\r\n\r\n\r\n        // update circle ui according to selected state:\r\n        selected.addListener((obs, wasSelected, isNowSelected) -&gt; {\r\n            if (isNowSelected) {\r\n                Color fillColor = (Color) uiComponent.getFill();\r\n                Color complementary = Color.color(1.0 - fillColor.getRed(), 1.0 - fillColor.getBlue(), 1.0 - fillColor.getGreen());\r\n                uiComponent.setStroke(complementary);\r\n                uiComponent.requestFocus();\r\n            } else {\r\n                uiComponent.setStroke(Color.TRANSPARENT);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    public void handleCircleMovement(KeyEvent event){\r\n        switch (event.getCode()) {\r\n            case LEFT:\r\n                uiComponent.setCenterX(uiComponent.getCenterX() - 10);\r\n                event.consume();\r\n                break;\r\n            case RIGHT:\r\n                uiComponent.setCenterX(uiComponent.getCenterX() + 10);\r\n                event.consume();\r\n                break;\r\n            case UP:\r\n                uiComponent.setCenterY(uiComponent.getCenterY() - 10);\r\n                event.consume();\r\n                break;\r\n            case DOWN:\r\n                uiComponent.setCenterY(uiComponent.getCenterY() + 10);\r\n                event.consume();\r\n                break;\r\n            default:\r\n                break;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void handleCircleDragStart(MouseEvent event){\r\n        xOffset = event.getSceneX() - uiComponent.getCenterX();\r\n        yOffset = event.getSceneY() - uiComponent.getCenterY();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void handleCircleDrag(MouseEvent event){\r\n        double x = event.getSceneX() - xOffset;\r\n        double y = event.getSceneY() - yOffset;\r\n\r\n        uiComponent.setCenterX(x);\r\n        uiComponent.setCenterY(y);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public Circle getUIComponent() {\r\n        return uiComponent;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you will need a few changes in your controller code. When you add the circle, you need to do something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public void handleAddCircleButton() {\r\n\r\n        Random rand = new Random();\r\n        int x = rand.nextInt(500);\r\n        int y = rand.nextInt(200);\r\n\r\n        Color selectedColor = colorPicker.getValue();\r\n        double selectedSize = sizeSlider.getValue();\r\n\r\n        SelectableCircle circle = new SelectableCircle(x, y, selectedSize, selectedColor);\r\n\r\n        // if selected state of circle changes, update our selectedCircle:\r\n        circle.selectedProperty().addListener((obs, wasSelected, isNowSelected) -&gt; {\r\n            if (selectedCircle != null) {\r\n                selectedCircle.setSelected(false);\r\n                selectedCircle = null;\r\n            }\r\n            if (isNowSelected) {\r\n                selectedCircle = circle;\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        circles.add(circle);\r\n        containerPane.getChildren().add(circle.getUIComponent());\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;New circle was created!&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo clear the selection, all we need to do is tell the current selection not to be selected any more (the listener takes care of the rest):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public void handleContainerPaneClick(MouseEvent event) {\r\n        if (selectedCircle != null &amp;&amp; !selectedCircle.getUIComponent().contains(event.getX(), event.getY())) {\r\n            selectedCircle.setSelected(false);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then in various places (basically when working with the UI) you will need to refer to `selectedCircle.getUIComponent()` instead of just `selectedCircle`. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public void handleDeleteButton(ActionEvent event) {\r\n        if (selectedCircle != null) {\r\n            circles.remove(selectedCircle);\r\n            containerPane.getChildren().remove(selectedCircle.getUIComponent());\r\n            selectedCircle = null;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```","title":"How to separate elements into classes in JavaFX?","body":"<p>This is a pretty broad question and is arguably a bit too opinion-based for this site, but I will try to give a couple of pointers.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Your classes should each have a single responsibility, and should only contain fields and methods related to that responsibility. If you have a class called <code>MyCircle</code>, each instance of that class represents a single circle. &quot;Which circle is selected&quot; is not part of the responsibility of that class (it is part of the broader application). In fact, you are implementing a business rule (that perhaps you haven't actually verbalized), that no more than one circle can be selected at once. It certainly is not the responsibility of <code>MyCircle</code> (which again, just represents a single circle) to implement that rule (or to keep track of which of the many circles is selected).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, &quot;is this circle selected&quot; probably is a responsibility of the <code>MyCircle</code> class. So some kind of boolean <code>selected</code> property might well be appropriate here. It's not too hard to see how to change such a property in response to a mouse click.</p>\n<p>This is actually the reason you're having trouble implementing this; you're trying to maintain the state of &quot;which circle is selected&quot; in <em>every</em> circle instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Favor composition over inheritance. This is one of the key items in Joshua Bloch's book <em>Effective Java</em> (which every Java Programmer should read). My particular rule of thumb is that if you are not adding functionality to a class, but are just providing a convenient way to configure instances of it, you should not subclass it. Even if you are adding some functionality (and in your case you can argue you are: you are adding the notion of selection), you might favor composition.</p>\n<p>Inheriting from a class means you have access to more of the inner workings of that class, and consequently you have more responsibility in terms of understanding how the class works in order not to write code which might not work the way you want. (&quot;Inheritance violates encapsulation&quot;, to quote Bloch.) The more complex a class is (and UI classes are <em>very</em> complex), the more wary you should be of subclassing them. I would not recommend subclassing <code>Circle</code> here.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first point creates a potential problem: we do need somewhere to track which circle is selected. If each circle only knows when it is selected, we need to know when any of the <code>selected</code> values (one for each circle) changes.
