Even if they are dynamic (have VTL code), then you can use #parse instead of #include and still get better performance than a macro.   I wouldn't even be surprised to learn that #define VTL blocks are faster than macros, though i haven't tested that.  Macros are great and very useful, but people do sometimes misuse or abuse them.</p>\n\n<p>The downside of #parse and #include is that you have to maintain more separate files, but that's the price for superior speed.  #define is great for code blocks that don't need args and/or need to be passed around as a reference, but you should only use #define'd blocks directly in the template that defines them or things can get confusing.</p>\n\n<p>Macros are great in that they take params and can be defined globally, and globally is where they perform best and make most sense.

Although not a &quot;fix&quot;, if you slow down the `producer` with a `Thread.sleep(100)` before the `synchronized` call, you should see that it now works because the `consumer` gets to its `wait()` _before_ the `producer` locks it out.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of ways for you to properly fix this.

Each Consumer and Producer needs to live on their own thread and we also MUST use Mutex/Semaphores OR Lock OR Monitor to allow exclusive access to the garage. Our problem now is that we don't know how to access and notify consumers from the producer thread (and vice versa). When we run it, this error comes:</p>\n<pre><code>java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException: current thread is not owner\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have linked the source code below. Whenever the garage is empty, the consumer is &quot;sleeping&quot; (we think that means .wait() ) and if it was full before he took a car, he must wake up ALL sleeping producers. Also if the garage was empty before the producer took the car off, he has to wake up ALL sleeping consumers.</p>\n<p>We have no idea if the way we approached it is correct or just complete nonsense.

Your second snippet calls the same method, <code>callAPI1</code>, each time, but with different id arguments. Besides that, if “<i>looks like the … are not happening in the same thread</i>” is a problem, why are you using <code>supplyAsync</code> at all? Since your second approach is blocking the caller until completion anyway, you can use <code>List&lt;String&gt; res1 = callAPI2(callAPI1(id1)), res2 = callAPI2(callAPI1(id2));</code> to achieve the same."}],"owner":{"account_id":11936627,"reputation":105,"user_id":8734879,"display_name":"Rufus7"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":259,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1654704146,"creation_date":1654704146,"question_id":72548870,"body_markdown":"I am new to multithreading and feel confused about it.\r\n\r\nI am trying to create two parallel threads, in each thread, it first calls an api-1 and get the response, then use that response to call the second api-2 and get the final result.\r\n\r\nThe first version code is like:\r\n```java\r\nCompletableFuture&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;
