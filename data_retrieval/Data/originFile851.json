In your given code, you only return if a certain condition is met. Otherwise, there is no return value. That&#39;s the issue with your code. \r\n\r\nOne thing you can do is to break the loop once your condition is met and then return at the end of the method.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static int wordCount(String sentence) {\r\n  int wc = 1;\r\n  for (int a = 0; a &lt;= sentence.length()-1; a++) {\r\n    if (sentence.charAt(a) == &#39; &#39;) {\r\n      wc += 1;\r\n    }\r\n    if (a == sentence.length()-1) {\r\n      break;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return wc;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in your code, you are checking the same condition twice.\r\n\r\nFirst, in your for loop, you are looping from `a = 0` to `a &lt;= sentence.length()-1`.\r\n\r\nYou can change it to this, to increase the readability of your code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfor (int a = 0; a &lt; sentence.length(); a++) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat this does is, you start your loop where `a = 0` and iterate until `a` is lesser than the length of the `sentence`. That is exactly same as &quot;until `a` is lesser than or equal to the (length of the `sentence` - `1`)&quot;. Check how the explanation of the code is also simpler here.\r\n\r\nThen inside your loop, you are checking whether `a == sentence.length() - 1` to return. But this is the exact condition your `for` loop is breaking on.\r\n\r\nSo, your code can be simplified to the following:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static int wordCount(String sentence) {\r\n  int wc = 1;\r\n  for (int a = 0; a &lt; sentence.length(); a++) {\r\n    if (sentence.charAt(a) == &#39; &#39;) {\r\n      wc += 1;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return wc;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have no other limitations, you can just use this to count the number of words:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static int wordCount(String sentence) {\r\n  String[] words = sentence.split(&quot; &quot;);\r\n  return words.length(); \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, even a one liner like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static int wordCount(String sentence) {\r\n  return sentence.split(&quot; &quot;).length(); \r\n}\r\n```","title":"How do I return a value which was changed in a for loop?","body":"<p>A method must return a value.

This whole MVP design is a bit confusing to me and I&#39;m trying my best to understand it and use the correct design structure but I think I am doing some things wrong. I also know that this code isn&#39;t very optimal with me drawing colored squares to artificially clear the maze or that I have a boolean in the render for the solving of the maze but I don&#39;t know what else to do as of now. \r\n\r\nThank you so much for taking a look and leaving any comments below it means a lot to me. I will continue to do research and try new things as this question is active and if I make any progress I will leave updates.","title":"How do I animate a draw call in android studio from the presenter?","body":"<h1>Issue</h1>\n<p>I have a project that I am writing where I have a maze that is randomly created with one button and and I can solve the maze with another button.
