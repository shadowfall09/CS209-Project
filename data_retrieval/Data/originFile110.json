I will draw your attention on some points you need to improve, but without preventing you from learning by doing.  \r\n\r\nFirst some formalities: \r\n\r\n* use the arrows for the relationships only to indicate [navigability][1]. If the link is bidirectional, either use 2 arrows or none. For example, here we could understand that `View` knows `ChessBoard`, but it is not clear if `ChessBoard` knows about `Views`: how can the `ChessBoard` then inform `Views` that the state of the board has changed after a move was done ?   \r\n* indicate the [multiplicity][2]: for exemple, I wonder if it is one `ChessBoard` for one `View` or could there be several `Views` for a same `Chessboard` ?  \r\n* avoid ambiguity between associations and properties.  For example, in `View`, you have a `model` property of type ChessBoard.  But you also have an association with `ChessBoard`.  So is this all the same `ChessBoard` ?  Or do we have two `ChessBoard`s, one associated and one embedded ? It would be clearer to remove the `model` from the properties, and indicate `model` as the name of the asscoiated object at the [end of the association][3].    \r\n*  The association starting from `Controller` that suddenly splits into two is not very practical, especially if you&#39;ll tell us about association ends and multiplicity.  Prefer to visually have two very distinct lines .  \r\n\r\n\r\nNow to the core:  \r\n\r\n* Your model should not just be a `ChessBoard`.  The model should be a `Game` that has a couple of elements.  `ChessBoard` is only one of them:  the current position of the `Piece`s.  But what about the `layers` ? Where are they ?  How do I know that it&#39;s two of them ?  How does the Controller know wo&#39;s turn it is ?  \r\n* By calling something `ChessBoard` that is more than a chess board, you might create a confusion.

I will draw your attention on some points you need to improve, but without preventing you from learning by doing.  </p>\n\n<p>First some formalities: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>use the arrows for the relationships only to indicate <a href=\"https://www.uml-diagrams.org/association.html#navigability\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">navigability</a>. If the link is bidirectional, either use 2 arrows or none. For example, here we could understand that <code>View</code> knows <code>ChessBoard</code>, but it is not clear if <code>ChessBoard</code> knows about <code>Views</code>: how can the <code>ChessBoard</code> then inform <code>Views</code> that the state of the board has changed after a move was done ?   </li>\n<li>indicate the <a href=\"https://www.uml-diagrams.org/multiplicity.html?context=class-diagrams\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">multiplicity</a>: for exemple, I wonder if it is one <code>ChessBoard</code> for one <code>View</code> or could there be several <code>Views</code> for a same <code>Chessboard</code> ?  </li>\n<li>avoid ambiguity between associations and properties.  For example, in <code>View</code>, you have a <code>model</code> property of type ChessBoard.  But you also have an association with <code>ChessBoard</code>.  So is this all the same <code>ChessBoard</code> ?  Or do we have two <code>ChessBoard</code>s, one associated and one embedded ? It would be clearer to remove the <code>model</code> from the properties, and indicate <code>model</code> as the name of the asscoiated object at the <a href=\"https://www.uml-diagrams.org/association.html#association-end\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">end of the association</a>.    </li>\n<li>The association starting from <code>Controller</code> that suddenly splits into two is not very practical, especially if you'll tell us about association ends and multiplicity.  Prefer to visually have two very distinct lines .  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now to the core:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your model should not just be a <code>ChessBoard</code>.  The model should be a <code>Game</code> that has a couple of elements.  <code>ChessBoard</code> is only one of them:  the current position of the <code>Piece</code>s.  But what about the <code>layers</code> ? Where are they ?  How do I know that it's two of them ?  How does the Controller know wo's turn it is ?  </li>\n<li>By calling something <code>ChessBoard</code> that is more than a chess board, you might create a confusion.  For example,  can the board know for sure if <code>isGameOver()</code>, just with the information on the position of the pieces ?  Isn't it possible that a player decides to abandon ?  So try to name your classes according to what they really represent.  </li>\n<li>How can I find out which <code>Pieces</code> are where on the board ?  </li>\n<li>How do I know the <a href=\"https://www.chessprogramming.org/Color\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">color</a> of a <code>Piece</code>  ?  </li>\n<li>How can I find out if a board's cell is free or occupied ?  </li>\n<li>What happens if a Piece is removed from the board because it was taken ?  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your UML diagram must evolve to clarify all this.

Some guides tell me everything is required, whilst others say about deprications: and it can be zero.</p>\n<p>I hope this is enough information. <em>Thank you, in advance.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Raw data (as requested) of current PE header:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>4D 5A 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 00 00 00 50 45 00 00 4C 01 02 00\nC8 7A 55 4B 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 E0 00 82 01 0B 01 0D 25 00 10 00 00\n00 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 10 00 00 00 10 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 00 40 00\n00 10 00 00 00 02 00 00 01 00 0B 00 00 00 00 00 03 00 0A 00 00 00 00 00\n00 22 00 00 38 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 03 00 00 00 00 40 00 00 00 40 00 00\n00 40 00 00 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 0E 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 20 00 00 24 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n2E 74 65 78 74 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 10 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 02 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 20 00 00 60 2E 69 64 61 74 61 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 40 00 00 C0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3C 20 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 24 20 00 00 34 20 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 00 4B 45 52 4E 45 4C 33 32 2E 64 6C 6C 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 80\n00 00 00 00 01 00 00 80 00 00 00 00\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","selenium-webdriver","xpath","dopostback","javascriptexecutor"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":6077817,"reputation":1213,"user_id":4744568,"display_name":"pcalkins"},"score":0,"creation_date":1694803520,"post_id":77109360,"comment_id":135944152,"body_markdown":"use XPATH of &quot;//a(@id=&#39;ctl00_Content1_button_accept&#39;)&quot;... so:  WE = g_WD.findElement(By.xpath(&quot;//a(@id=&#39;ctl00_Content1_button_accept&#39;)&quot;));\n        WE.click();  Don&#39;t worry about hidden fields, they are submitted with the form.","body":"use XPATH of &quot;//a(@id=&#39;ctl00_Content1_button_accept&#39;)&quot;... so:  WE = g_WD.findElement(By.xpath(&quot;//a(@id=&#39;ctl00_Content1_button_ac&zwnj;&#8203;cept&#39;)&quot;));         WE.click();  Don&#39;t worry about hidden fields, they are submitted with the form."},{"owner":{"account_id":12027303,"reputation":1,"user_id":8798735,"display_name":"StrugglingDev"},"score":0,"creation_date":1694811343,"post_id":77109360,"comment_id":135945307,"body_markdown":"@pcalkins Thanks for taking the time to respond.

This is expected as persist() does not work outside the transaction boundaries.\r\n\r\nThis is the output I am getting and the exception is clear as object has not been moved to persistent state.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nHibernate: drop table if exists employee.Employee\r\nHibernate: create table employee.Employee (eid integer not null auto_increment, employeename varchar(255), designation varchar(255), primary key (eid))\r\nOct 22, 2023 1:29:35 PM org.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport execute\r\nINFO: HHH000230: Schema export complete\r\nHibernate: select employee0_.eid as eid0_0_, employee0_.employeename as employee2_0_0_, employee0_.designation as designat3_0_0_ from employee.Employee employee0_ where employee0_.eid=?\r\nException in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke &quot;org.example.Employee.toString()&quot; because &quot;e2&quot; is null\r\n\tat org.example.App.main(App.java:28)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I remove the primary key generator in mapping file and manually assign the primary key and if I call the persist() method, then it works, it is moving the object to the persistent state even outside the transaction boundary.

What is meant by a transaction boundary?\r\n\r\n2. The save() method is printing the insert statement in console when I am using primary key generator, but it is not printing the insert statement when I am manually assigning the primary key. Why is that so?\r\n\r\n3. The persist() method is not working outside the transaction boundaries. This statement holds true when I am using primary key generators, but if I am using the same persist() method outside the transaction without the primary key generators then it works by moving the object to persistent state even outside the transaction boundary. Why is it working in this way?\r\n\r\nPlease help in clarifying the above questions as these methods are behaving differently when used with and without the primary key generator.\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t mark this question as duplicate, in this question I have asked very specific question related to behaviour of save() and persist() wrt Primary Key generators.\r\n","title":"save() and persist() method work differently in case of primary key generators","body":"<p>I am currently learning Hibernate.

When deadlock occurs, the value of wait semaphore,leftCnt and westCnt are 0, but it will release wait semaphore when leftCnt or westCnt equals zero. \r\nBut if I use MyInt, everything goes will.\r\n\r\nMy solution as follow:\r\n```java\r\nimport java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;\r\n//person from east to west\r\npublic class Task1 implements Runnable{\r\n    Semaphore east, west, wait;\r\n//    MyInt westCnt, eastCnt;\r\n//    public Task1(Semaphore east, Semaphore west, Semaphore wait, MyInt westCnt, MyInt eastCnt) {\r\n//        this.east = east;\r\n//        this.west = west;\r\n//        this.wait = wait;\r\n//        this.westCnt = westCnt;\r\n//        this.eastCnt = eastCnt;\r\n//    }\r\n    Integer westCnt, eastCnt;\r\n    public Task1(Semaphore east, Semaphore west, Semaphore wait, Integer westCnt, Integer eastCnt) {\r\n        this.east = east;\r\n        this.west = west;\r\n        this.wait = wait;\r\n        this.westCnt = westCnt;\r\n        this.eastCnt = eastCnt;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void run() {\r\n        try {\r\n            east.acquire();\r\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n            e.printStackTrace();\r\n        }\r\n//        eastCnt.inc();\r\n//        if(eastCnt.getInteger() == 1) {\r\n//            try {\r\n//                wait.acquire();\r\n//            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n//                e.printStackTrace();\r\n//            }\r\n//        }\r\n\r\n        eastCnt++;\r\n        if(eastCnt.equals(1)) {\r\n            try {\r\n                wait.acquire();\r\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n                e.printStackTrace();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;E -&gt;

I use the SuperCSV library for Java.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning everything works, but now I&#39;m faced with one problem. I started to receive strange CSV files. I always open them with Notepad++. At this time the file seems to look usual, the encoding in the lower right corner is standard UTF-8, this is OK:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there are strange NUL characters (with one letter &quot;L&quot;) in the text:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2] \r\n\r\nAnd due to them, the file is not parsed. I started debugging the code and this is what I discovered: first there is a file header with the names of the columns. Then there are 2 lines without this NUL-character. These two lines are parsed normally:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nBut then the third line contains the NUL character for the first time and from that moment on everything is parsed incorrectly.

With the right visibility, you will get more specific errors. \r\n- **Static** (variables and methods) : \r\nThey are variables and methods that belong to a class rather than instances of the class.\r\nHere is an example :\r\nLet&#39;s say you have a class A:\r\n\r\n    public class A{\r\n\r\n      static int i = 0;\r\n      int j ;\r\n\r\n      public A(int k){\r\n        this.i = k;\r\n      }\r\n      public static printI(){\r\n        System.out.println(this.i);\r\n      }\r\n      public printJ(){\r\n        System.out.println(this.j);\r\n      }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nThen :\r\n\r\n    A a = new A();\r\n    A b = new B();\r\n    \r\n    a.printI() # 0\r\n    \r\n    a.i++; \r\n    a.j++;\r\n    a.printI() # 1\r\n    A.printI() #1\r\n    a.printJ(); # 1\r\n    b.printJ(); # 0\r\n\r\nAs you can see, i is shared by a and b.\r\n\r\n**And even A**, the class itself. That means that you don&#39;t need the instantiate an object of A in order to manipulate i. \r\nIt&#39;s the same thing like when you do Math.PI (PI is a static variable of Math class).\r\nSo if you get this, you can also understand that a **static method can&#39;t manipulate non-static variables** (because a non-static variable is born at instantiation of an object of the class while a static variable doesn&#39;t need that).\r\n\r\nIn your case, main is (generally) a static method, that&#39;s why it asks you to change variables to static.\r\n\r\nThere are many basic notions like those in order to code in Java.

If I call the save method, I am getting the below lines in output:-\r\n\r\n```\r\nHibernate: drop table if exists employee.Employee\r\nHibernate: create table employee.Employee (eid integer not null auto_increment, employeename varchar(255), designation varchar(255), primary key (eid))\r\nOct 22, 2023 1:21:09 PM org.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport execute\r\nINFO: HHH000230: Schema export complete\r\nHibernate: insert into employee.Employee (employeename, designation) values (?, ?)\r\nEmployee{employeeid=1, employeename=&#39;Chris&#39;, designation=&#39;Developer&#39;}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I remove the primary key generator in the mapping file and manually assign the primary key in the App.java file:-\r\n\r\n```\r\nemployee.setId(1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nMapping file:-\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE hibernate-mapping PUBLIC\r\n        &quot;-//Hibernate/Hibernate Mapping DTD 3.0//EN&quot;\r\n        &quot;http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-mapping-3.0.dtd&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;hibernate-mapping&gt;\r\n    &lt;class name=&quot;org.example.Employee&quot; schema=&quot;employee&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;id name=&quot;employeeid&quot; column=&quot;eid&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;!--  &lt;generator class=&quot;native&quot;&gt;&lt;/generator&gt;--&gt;\r\n        &lt;/id&gt;\r\n        &lt;property name=&quot;employeename&quot;/&gt;\r\n        &lt;property name=&quot;designation&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/class&gt;\r\n&lt;/hibernate-mapping&gt;\r\n```\r\nand then if I run the App.java, then the save() method is not doing the inerstion..i.e. the insertion command is not printing in the console.\r\nI am getting the following output with out the primary key generator.\r\n\r\n```\r\nHibernate: drop table if exists employee.Employee\r\nHibernate: create table employee.Employee (eid integer not null, employeename varchar(255), designation varchar(255), primary key (eid))\r\nOct 22, 2023 1:24:59 PM org.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport execute\r\nINFO: HHH000230: Schema export complete\r\nEmployee{employeeid=1, employeename=&#39;Chris&#39;, designation=&#39;Developer&#39;}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy is the insert command not present??\r\n\r\nSame thing I tried for persist() method too...\r\n\r\nIf I change save to persist in App.java\r\n\r\n```\r\n session.persist(employee);\r\n```\r\nand run the file with the primary key generator, then the insert command is not printing. This is expected as persist() does not work outside the transaction boundaries.\r\n\r\nThis is the output I am getting and the exception is clear as object has not been moved to persistent state.\r\n\r\n```\r\nHibernate: drop table if exists employee.Employee\r\nHibernate: create table employee.Employee (eid integer not null auto_increment, employeename varchar(255), designation varchar(255), primary key (eid))\r\nOct 22, 2023 1:29:35 PM org.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaExport execute\r\nINFO: HHH000230: Schema export complete\r\nHibernate: select employee0_.eid as eid0_0_, employee0_.employeename as employee2_0_0_, employee0_.designation as designat3_0_0_ from employee.Employee employee0_ where employee0_.eid=?\r\nException in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke &quot;org.example.Employee.toString()&quot; because &quot;e2&quot; is null\r\n\tat org.example.App.main(App.java:28)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow if I remove the primary key generator in mapping file and manually assign the Primary key and If I call the persist() method, then it works it is moving the object to the persistent state even outside the transaction boundary.

This statement holds true when I am using primary key generators, but if I am using the same persist() method outside the transaction without the primary key generators then it works by moving the object to persistent state even outside the transaction boundary.

With this in mind, my activity class looks like this:</p>\n<p><strong>EightHoleActivity.java</strong></p>\n<pre><code>package com.example.game;\n\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport android.os.Bundle;\nimport com.google.android.material.tabs.TabLayout;\nimport com.google.android.material.tabs.TabLayoutMediator;\nimport androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;\nimport androidx.viewpager2.widget.ViewPager2;\n\npublic class EightHoleActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n\n    private long gameID;\n    private RoomDB database;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_eight_hole);\n\n        Intent intent = getIntent();\n        gameID = intent.getLongExtra(&quot;GameID&quot;, 0);\n        database = RoomDB.getInstance(EightHoleActivity.this);\n\n        ViewPager2 viewPager2 = findViewById(R.id.eight_hole_view_pager);\n        viewPager2.setAdapter(new EightHolePagerAdapter(this));\n        TabLayout tabLayout = findViewById(R.id.eight_hole_tabs);\n        TabLayoutMediator tabLayoutMediator = new TabLayoutMediator(\n                tabLayout, viewPager2, (tab, position) -&gt; {\n                    switch (position){\n                        case 0: {\n                            tab.setText(&quot;Current game&quot;);\n                            tab.setIcon(R.drawable.ic_twotone_games_24);\n                            break;\n                        }\n                        default: {\n                            tab.setText(&quot;Scores&quot;);\n                            tab.setIcon(R.drawable.ic_baseline_list_24);\n                            break;\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n        );\n        tabLayoutMediator.attach();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, I have a <code>RoomDatabase</code> which I use to store the data within the application.

But, for fun, I will take a stab at revamping your code.\r\n\r\nOne big useful concept in programming in [separation of concerns][1]. This means organizing your code in separate chunks that each focus on a particular job. \r\n\r\nOne job is writing your grocery list items to storage, and reading them back. That should be in one specific class. We will call this class `Repository`.\r\n\r\nWe need to define the objects to go into the repository. Your `GroceryList` class is ill-conceived as the list is just a collection of items. It is the item we need to define. We can that simply with a [record][2]. The one and only job of this class is to represent validated state necessary to represent a grocery item from the real world.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic record GroceryItem( String name )\r\n{\r\n    public GroceryItem ( final String name )\r\n    {\r\n        Objects.requireNonNull ( name );\r\n        if ( name.isBlank ( ) ) throw new IllegalArgumentException ( &quot;Grocery item name cannot be blank.&quot; );\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe repository needs to save grocery items and retrieve again. The one and only job of this class is the persistent storage and retrieval of our objects’ state.

We can deterimine with certainty that the bug lives in this file-based `Repository` implementation because we can switch back to the in-memory list based implementation to see the bug disappear. This bug-verification is a big benefit to writing the simpler bogus implementation. I will leave the undiscovered bug in place, as I have already done too much for a schoolwork assignment.\r\n\r\nAnother issue: All our tests pass despite the bug in this file-based implementation. That means our tests are insufficient, and need revision. I will leave that too as an exercise for the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\r\n  [2]: https://openjdk.org/jeps/395\r\n  [3]: https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests\r\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JUnit\r\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface\r\n  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaFX\r\n  [7]: https://openjfx.io/\r\n  [8]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/WJxxW.png\r\n  [9]: https://jenkov.com/tutorials/java-nio/index.html\r\n  [10]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api//java.base/java/nio/file/Path.html\r\n  [11]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api//java.base/java/nio/file/Paths.html\r\n  [12]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api//java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html","title":"JavaFX build crashes when trying to read from file","body":"<p>Your Question is unfocused and unclear.

The professor is asking us to make the list into a .txt file and read from that file. There is also a delete section and delete all which I haven&#39;t coded yet. Usually I test the code whenever I add something new into it. When trying to test this one I noticed that it crashes. The code is writing to the Grocery.txt but isn&#39;t showing what is wrote into the list box. I know I am most likely missing something small. When I look at my textbook &quot;Murach&#39;s Java programming 6th Edition&quot; It looks almost the same except the example they are using is reading three different things from the file. They are using a array to read. I am trying to place each one on its own line. I know right now it won&#39;t.

The professor is asking us to make the list into a .txt file and read from that file. There is also a delete section and delete all which I haven't coded yet. Usually I test the code whenever I add something new into it. When trying to test this one I noticed that it crashes. The code is writing to the Grocery.txt but isn't showing what is wrote into the list box. I know I am most likely missing something small. When I look at my textbook &quot;Murach's Java programming 6th Edition&quot; It looks almost the same except the example they are using is reading three different things from the file. They are using a array to read. I am trying to place each one on its own line. I know right now it won't. I am trying to test if it reads it at all which currently it isn't.</p>\n<p>Update: I changed some of the code around now when I click add I am getting an empty alert box that says error. Updated code is placed. I will be afk for a few hours and will be back to work on it. Thank you for all your help.</p>\n<p>FINAL update: found the error it was in my <code>if (errorMsg == &quot; &quot;) {</code> for some reason it wasn't reading it correctly changing it to <code>if(errorMsg.isBlank())</code> fixed it.
