Deriving from these I created a resource `CustomerResource` that exposes various endpoints relating to the `Customer` entity that lead to basic *CRUD* operations. Some of these endpoints are:\r\n- POST   (/customers/create) \r\n- GET    (/customers/get)    \r\n- GET    (/customers/get/{id})\r\n- PUT    (/customers/update/{id})\r\n- DELETE (/customers/delete/{id}  \r\n\r\nThe problem arises when I create the second resource `AddressResource` which will handle endpoints relating to operations for the `Address` entity. This entity **cannot** exist without a `Customer` and as such I came to the decision to convey that using nested `URI` scheme, as opposed to using `QueryParams`. Now, as you can imagine, some of the endpoints that the `AddressResource` exposes are:  \r\n- POST   (/customers/{id}/address/create)\r\n- GET    (/customers/{id}/address/get)\r\n- PUT    (/customers/{id}/address/update)\r\n- DELETE (/customers/{id}/address/delete)  \r\n\r\nI&#39;m faced with validating **IF** the `Customer ID` exists and then continuing on to the actual operation that the endpoint entails. Looking the app design from a top down viewpoint, right after the `Resource` classes come the `Service` classes. For each `Resource` class there is a `Service` class which carry out any necessary business logic and call for the `DAO` classes to reflect all the necessary changes to the physical DB and the persistence context. So, any validation happens on the `Service` layer. The thing is that the `AddressService` class will have to make a call to check if the `Customer` exists using the `CustomerDao` class, which queries the database for the given `customerId` and returns its findings. If the customer exists then the `AddressDao` gets called to perform the corresponding query on the DB relating to the `Address` entities.\r\n\r\nSo, in a sense, **I want to avoid the coupling of the `Service` classes passing calls to multiple `Dao` classes, as well as, avoid any duplicate code that validation for multiple resources might lead to**.  \r\n\r\nThis is due to the fact that I want to introduce a new *One-To-Many* resource that also requires validation on the `customerId` level and this would entail its `Service` class also calling the `CustomerDao`. I&#39;m aware of the *N+1 query problem* and I&#39;m keeping the nested resource depth at a maximum of 2.

I've setup Java Util Logging for Oracle according to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/40491028/216353\">this answer</a>, to try to capture things at the lowest level I can.</p>\n<p>My application is using Hibernate (currently 3.2.3.ga).</p>\n<p>When I use <code>oracle.jdbc.level=CONFIG</code> or <code>oracle.jdbc.level=FINE</code> in my <code>logging.properties</code>, see a pretty reasonable level of logging, but I don't see ANY of the update statements my application is issuing.

It seems like they're getting caught by the code to &quot;Logs calls to internal methods&quot; with the <code>FINEST</code> setting, and a single update statement will show up in the logs dozens of times. Here's an example:</p>\n<pre><code>FINEST oracle.jdbc: 212E0078 Enter: &quot;update &lt;REDACTED FOR STACK OVERFLOW&gt;&quot; \nFINEST oracle.jdbc: 212E0078 Enter: &quot;update &lt;REDACTED FOR STACK OVERFLOW&gt;&quot;, -1, -1 \nFINEST oracle.jdbc: 212E0078 Enter: &quot;update &lt;REDACTED FOR STACK OVERFLOW&gt;&quot;, &quot;[ {result_set_type=-1}  {use_long_fetch=false}  {result_set_concurrency=-1} ]&quot; \nFINEST oracle.jdbc: 212E0078 Enter: &quot;update &lt;REDACTED FOR STACK OVERFLOW&gt;&quot;, &quot;[ {result_set_type=-1}  {use_long_fetch=false}  {result_set_concurrency=-1} ]&quot; \nFINEST oracle.jdbc: 212E0078 Enter: void \nFINEST oracle.jdbc: 212E0078 Return: void \nFINEST oracle.jdbc: 212E0078 Exit: [0.012976 ms] \nFINEST oracle.jdbc: 2C5FB90F Enter: oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CConnection@212e0078, &quot;update &lt;REDACTED FOR STACK OVERFLOW&gt;&quot;, &quot;[ {result_set_type=-1}  {use_long_fetch=false}  {result_set_concurrency=-1} ]&quot; \nFINEST oracle.jdbc:          Enter: oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CConnection@212e0078 \nFINEST oracle.jdbc:          Return: void \nFINEST oracle.jdbc:          Exit: [0.012198 ms] \nFINEST oracle.jdbc:          Enter: oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CConnection@212e0078, &quot;[ {result_set_type=-1}  {use_long_fetch=false}  {result_set_concurrency=-1} ]&quot; \nFINEST oracle.jdbc:          Enter: oracle.jdbc.driver.T4CPreparedStatement@9887002 \nFINEST oracle.jdbc:          Return: void \nFINEST oracle.jdbc:          Exit: [0.016657 ms] \n</code></pre>\n<p>I would have assumed that the <code>oracle.jdbc.level=FINE</code> setting should catch update statements, because the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/java.111/b31224/diagnose.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">documentation</a> says it logs &quot;Logs the entry and exit to every public method providing a detailed trace of JDBC operations&quot;, but it's logging almost exactly the same stuff as <code>oracle.jdbc.level=CONFIG</code>.</p>\n<p>I've tried with the following Oracle drivers (in Gradle dependency format):</p>\n<pre><code>compile group: 'com.oracle.database.jdbc.debug', name: 'ojdbc8_g', version: '12.2.0.1'\n\ncompile group: 'com.oracle.database.jdbc.debug', name: 'ojdbc8_g', version: '21.3.0.0'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is there any way to configure the Oracle driver to log ALL select, update, insert, and delete statements, and not much else?  I've also tried setting <code>oracle.sql.level=FINE</code> and <code>oracle.level=FINER</code>, but nothing useful about updates appears to be getting logged at those levels or higher.</p>\n<h1>Update</h1>\n<p>I setup p6spy and it <em>also</em> failed to log insert and update statements.

Eclipse provides a way to automatically do this, but it basically just takes all the literal strings, puts them in a separate file, and reads from that file to get the appropriate string.

I am not sure if I will need to do anything special to get it to run on an AWS elastic beanstalk server, but I might make a comment here if I do need to.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2190846,"reputation":91,"user_id":1937953,"display_name":"Evyatar Kafkafi"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"is_accepted":false,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1518587907,"creation_date":1518587907,"answer_id":48780566,"question_id":46821310,"body_markdown":"The solution is presented here\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/45263216/1937953\r\n\r\nTLDR remove `&lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;` from the dependency of `spring-boot-starter-tomcat` in the pom.xml file\r\n\r\n","title":"Spring Boot Application Throwing Startup Failed Error When Trying to Run","body":"<p>The solution is presented here\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/45263216/1937953\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/45263216/1937953</a></p>\n\n<p>TLDR remove <code>&lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;</code> from the dependency of <code>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</code> in the pom.xml file</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":18186613,"reputation":41,"user_id":13358913,"display_name":"Govind "},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1593664861,"creation_date":1593664861,"answer_id":62689145,"question_id":46821310,"body_markdown":"i think there is a misunderstanding here, in spring boot we don&#39;t need to create a war in order to deploy in tomcat server.

I am working on mobile application. </p>\n\n<p>Can you please guide me?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","string","character","java.util.scanner"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1616980,"reputation":616,"user_id":1494395,"accept_rate":0,"display_name":"Rajith Pemabandu"},"score":0,"creation_date":1500690684,"post_id":45250024,"comment_id":77464962,"body_markdown":"suppose you move the `in.close()` out side the `while` loop.","body":"suppose you move the <code>in.close()</code> out side the <code>while</code> loop."}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2970485,"reputation":1625,"user_id":2522630,"display_name":"nickrak"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1500690554,"creation_date":1500690554,"answer_id":45250071,"question_id":45250024,"body_markdown":"You should close the Scanner after you&#39;re done using it.

For this to work, imagine that there is nothing special about 0 or 99. It&#39;s just another index, and _ALL_ indexes have a next and previous. You&#39;ll need to emulate this ring in your code with some very simplistic math (going &#39;down&#39; from the 0 should start at `length -1`, and going &#39;up&#39; from the `length -1` slot should go to 0, but that&#39;s all you really need).\r\n\r\nIn your current implementation, you have a backing array of, say, size 150, but your data structure only has length, say, 100.

To add elements to the front, add them to the right place and decrement the &#39;front of the sublist&#39; marker. Keep in mind that it&#39;s a ring, so &#39;add 1 to the end marker&#39; may involve turning `99` into `0` if the current backing array capacity is 100.

For example, if your backing array has 150 elements, &#39;start&#39; is currently at 140, and &#39;end&#39; is at 88, then `.get(55)` means you need to return `backingArray[45]`. The math is fortunately simple if you know about the modulo operator (`%`). The module operator is like divide, except it returns the remainder and discards the actual result. So, `start + index % backingArray.length` is what you want: `(140 + 45) % 150` is 45, as you&#39;d want.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll need to play around with the concept some, and experiment with modulo to write the code in a succint manner.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that the aim is to __NOT__ copy the entire array over in either the add-to-the-back _or_ add-to-the-front operation unless the backing array&#39;s filled up.

By the way, the Java tool option, &quot; -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError&quot;, does not create a heap dump on direct memory exceptions.</p>\n<pre>\nSep 20 23:02:55 CKM01204505062-A control-path[128819]: 2021-09-20 23:02:55.266 [] [INFO] [com.emc.bedrock.http.HttpVerticle|vert.x-eventloop-thread-3]  Request ID: 2c7633a4-db9c-4ec5-b4ca-c93c47512384 completed in 4 ms.\nSep 20 23:02:55 CKM01204505062-A control-path[128199]: Exception in thread \"iothread-2\" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Direct buffer memory\nSep 20 23:02:55 CKM01204505062-A control-path[128199]:         at java.nio.Bits.reserveMemory(Bits.java:695)\nSep 20 23:02:55 CKM01204505062-A control-path[128199]:         at java.nio.DirectByteBuffer.(DirectByteBuffer.java:123)\nSep 20 23:02:55 CKM01204505062-A control-path[128199]:         at java.nio.ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(ByteBuffer.java:311)\nSep 20 23:02:55 CKM01204505062-A control-path[128199]:         at zmq.DecoderBase.(DecoderBase.java:35)\nSep 20 23:02:55 CKM01204505062-A control-path[128199]:         at zmq.V1Decoder.(V1Decoder.java:21)\nSep 20 23:02:55 CKM01204505062-A control-path[128199]:         at zmq.StreamEngine.newDecoder(StreamEngine.java:102)\nSep 20 23:02:55 CKM01204505062-A control-path[128199]:         at zmq.StreamEngine.handshake(StreamEngine.java:549)\nSep 20 23:02:55 CKM01204505062-A control-path[128199]:         at zmq.StreamEngine.inEvent(StreamEngine.java:278)\nSep 20 23:02:55 CKM01204505062-A control-path[128199]:         at zmq.IOObject.inEvent(IOObject.java:86)\nSep 20 23:02:55 CKM01204505062-A control-path[128199]:         at zmq.Poller.run(Poller.java:228)\nSep 20 23:02:55 CKM01204505062-A control-path[128199]:         at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\n</pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","algorithm","java-stream","big-o","coding-efficiency"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3211603,"reputation":289297,"user_id":2711488,"display_name":"Holger"},"score":1,"creation_date":1634109708,"post_id":69546951,"comment_id":122934642,"body_markdown":"If you care for performance, [don’t use `LinkedList`](https://stackoverflow.com/q/322715/2711488), in almost every case, either of `ArrayDeque` or `ArrayList` will do better.
