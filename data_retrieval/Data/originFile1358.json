It is a bad idea.  \r\n\r\nThe `compute` function will be called while holding a lock on part of the map.  As the javadoc states:\r\n\r\n&gt; *&quot;Some attempted update operations on this map by other threads may be blocked while computation is in progress, so the computation should be short and simple, and must not attempt to update any other mappings of this map.&quot;*\r\n\r\nA `wait()` call implies the possibility that other threads using the map may be blocked for the duration of the wait.\r\n\r\nI guess your idea of &quot;something equivalent&quot; is another way of waiting on the condition.

I&#39;m in the process of adding another entity which has a one-to-one relationship with another entity that is already in a bidirectional one-to-one relationship with the owning user data entity.\r\n\r\nFor clarification let&#39;s assume we have the following owning entity:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Entity(name = &quot;user_data&quot;)\r\npublic class UserDataEntity {\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue\r\n    private int id;\r\n\r\n    @OneToOne(mappedBy = &quot;userData&quot;, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)\r\n    private OtherDataEntity otherData;\r\n\r\n    // other one-to-one relations\r\n\r\n    // other fields, getter, setter etc.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we have the `OtherDataEntity`:\r\n```\r\n@Entity(name = &quot;other_data&quot;)\r\npublic class OtherDataEntity {\r\n    @Id\r\n    private int id;\r\n\r\n    @MapsId\r\n    @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, optional = false)\r\n    private UserDataEntity userData;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso there is a unique constrain added via liquibase:\r\n```\r\n&lt;changeSet&gt;\r\n    &lt;addForeignKeyConstraint\r\n        baseColumnNames=&quot;user_data_id&quot;\r\n        baseTableName=&quot;other_data&quot;\r\n        constraintName=&quot;someID&quot;\r\n        deferrable=&quot;false&quot;\r\n        initiallyDeferred=&quot;false&quot;\r\n        onDelete=&quot;NO ACTION&quot;\r\n        onUpdate=&quot;NO ACTION&quot;\r\n        referencedColumnNames=&quot;id&quot;\r\n        referencedTableName=&quot;user_data&quot;\r\n        validate=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;\r\n&lt;/changeSet&gt;\r\n```\r\nThis works just fine but now I want to add another entity which is logically related to `OtherDataEntity` by a one-to-one relationship.\r\n\r\nSo I naively added the `AdditionalDataEntity` to `OtherDataEntity` like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Entity(name = &quot;other_data&quot;)\r\npublic class OtherDataEntity {\r\n    @Id\r\n    private int id;\r\n\r\n    @MapsId\r\n    @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, optional = false)\r\n    private UserDataEntity userData;\r\n\r\n    @OneToOne(mappedBy = &quot;otherData&quot;, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)\r\n    private AdditionalDataEntity additionalData;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Entity(name = &quot;additional_data&quot;)\r\npublic class AdditionalDataEntity {\r\n    @Id\r\n    private int id;\r\n\r\n    @MapsId\r\n    @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, optional = false)\r\n    private OtherDataEntity otherData;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve then added a similar unique constrain on this entity with liquibase\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;changeSet&gt;\r\n    &lt;addForeignKeyConstraint\r\n        baseColumnNames=&quot;user_data_id&quot;\r\n        baseTableName=&quot;additional_data&quot;\r\n        constraintName=&quot;someId&quot;\r\n        deferrable=&quot;false&quot;\r\n        initiallyDeferred=&quot;false&quot;\r\n        onDelete=&quot;NO ACTION&quot;\r\n        onUpdate=&quot;NO ACTION&quot;\r\n        referencedColumnNames=&quot;user_data_id&quot;\r\n        referencedTableName=&quot;other_data&quot;\r\n        validate=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;\r\n&lt;/changeSet&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor both entities there is a `user_data_id` column present in the corresponding tables but I&#39;m getting an error once I try to get, create or update a dataset:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.hibernate.exception.SQLGrammarException: could not extract ResultSet\r\n\tat

I have now is:\r\n\r\nIs this a valid approach and I&#39;m doing something wrong or is the nesting of this style not working at all?","title":"Nesting one-to-one relationship in already owned entity","body":"<p>I'm working on a project with multiple user data mapped to a user by one-to-one relationships in the entities. I'm in the process of adding another entity which has a one-to-one relationship with another entity that is already in a bidirectional one-to-one relationship with the owning user data entity.</p>\n<p>For clarification let's assume we have the following owning entity:</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity(name = &quot;user_data&quot;)\npublic class UserDataEntity {\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue\n    private int id;\n\n    @OneToOne(mappedBy = &quot;userData&quot;, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)\n    private OtherDataEntity otherData;\n\n    // other one-to-one relations\n\n    // other fields, getter, setter etc.\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then we have the <code>OtherDataEntity</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity(name = &quot;other_data&quot;)\npublic class OtherDataEntity {\n    @Id\n    private int id;\n\n    @MapsId\n    @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, optional = false)\n    private UserDataEntity userData;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also there is a unique constrain added via liquibase:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;changeSet&gt;\n    &lt;addForeignKeyConstraint\n        baseColumnNames=&quot;user_data_id&quot;\n        baseTableName=&quot;other_data&quot;\n        constraintName=&quot;someID&quot;\n        deferrable=&quot;false&quot;\n        initiallyDeferred=&quot;false&quot;\n        onDelete=&quot;NO ACTION&quot;\n        onUpdate=&quot;NO ACTION&quot;\n        referencedColumnNames=&quot;id&quot;\n        referencedTableName=&quot;user_data&quot;\n        validate=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/changeSet&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This works just fine but now I want to add another entity which is logically related to <code>OtherDataEntity</code> by a one-to-one relationship.</p>\n<p>So I naively added the <code>AdditionalDataEntity</code> to <code>OtherDataEntity</code> like this:</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity(name = &quot;other_data&quot;)\npublic class OtherDataEntity {\n    @Id\n    private int id;\n\n    @MapsId\n    @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, optional = false)\n    private UserDataEntity userData;\n\n    @OneToOne(mappedBy = &quot;otherData&quot;, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)\n    private AdditionalDataEntity additionalData;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>@Entity(name = &quot;additional_data&quot;)\npublic class AdditionalDataEntity {\n    @Id\n    private int id;\n\n    @MapsId\n    @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, optional = false)\n    private OtherDataEntity otherData;\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've then added a similar unique constrain on this entity with liquibase</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;changeSet&gt;\n    &lt;addForeignKeyConstraint\n        baseColumnNames=&quot;user_data_id&quot;\n        baseTableName=&quot;additional_data&quot;\n        constraintName=&quot;someId&quot;\n        deferrable=&quot;false&quot;\n        initiallyDeferred=&quot;false&quot;\n        onDelete=&quot;NO ACTION&quot;\n        onUpdate=&quot;NO ACTION&quot;\n        referencedColumnNames=&quot;user_data_id&quot;\n        referencedTableName=&quot;other_data&quot;\n        validate=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/changeSet&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>For both entities there is a <code>user_data_id</code> column present in the corresponding tables but I'm getting an error once I try to get, create or update a dataset:</p>\n<pre><code>Caused by:

You need to specify `--batch-mode` to make this work.\r\n  MAVEN_OPTS: &gt;-\r\n    -Dhttps.protocols=TLSv1.2\r\n    -Dmaven.repo.local=.m2/repository\r\n    -Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.org.apache.maven.cli.transfer.Slf4jMavenTransferListener=WARN\r\n    -Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.showDateTime=true\r\n    -Djava.awt.headless=true\r\n  # As of Maven 3.3.0 instead of this you may define these options in `.mvn/maven.config` so the same config is used\r\n  # when running from the command line.\r\n  # `installAtEnd` and `deployAtEnd` are only effective with recent version of the corresponding plugins.\r\n  MAVEN_CLI_OPTS: &gt;-\r\n    --batch-mode\r\n    --errors\r\n    --fail-at-end\r\n    --show-version\r\n    -DinstallAtEnd=true\r\n    -DdeployAtEnd=true  \r\n\r\njava-build:\r\n  # select the most appropriate image for your project\r\n  image: maven:3.8-openjdk-11\r\n  stage: build\r\n  # Cache downloaded dependencies and plugins between builds.\r\n  # The key here separates one cache per branch/tag ($CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG)\r\n  cache:\r\n    key: &quot;maven-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG&quot;\r\n    paths:\r\n      - .m2/repository\r\n  script:\r\n    - mvn $MAVEN_CLI_OPTS package -DskipTests=true\r\n  artifacts:\r\n    name: &quot;Maven artifacts from $CI_PROJECT_NAME on $CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG&quot;\r\n    paths:\r\n      - &quot;**/target&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. with unit tests\r\n\r\nThere are two options when integrating you unit tests in your CI/CD pipeline:\r\n\r\n1. run them in the same job as the build\r\n2. run them in a separate job\r\n\r\nAs a matter of pipeline execution speed and green-IT considerations, I definitely prefer option 1, but I admit people could prefer the second one.\r\n\r\nHere is the new version of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, also implementing [GitLab unit tests integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/unit_test_reports.html):\r\n\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nstages:\r\n  - build\r\n\r\nvariables:\r\n  # This will suppress any download for dependencies and plugins or upload messages which would clutter the console log.\r\n  # `showDateTime` will show the passed time in milliseconds.

For example:\r\n\r\n* [GitLab&#39;s Maven template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Maven.gitlab-ci.yml)\r\n* or [to-be-continuous template](https://gitlab.com/to-be-continuous/maven/)\r\n\r\n[to be continuous](https://to-be-continuous.gitlab.io/doc/) is an open-source project that provides a collection of ready-to-use, configurable, extensible, composable templates.\r\n\r\n## About Runners\r\n\r\nGitLab architecture is very versatile, with the notion of [Runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/).\r\nRunners are the basic _executors pool_ that make it possible to execute GitLab CI/CD jobs.\r\n\r\n2 things of interest to know about runners\r\n\r\n### 1. you can specialise your runners\r\n\r\nWith GitLab, you can register several kind of runners, made for special and complementary purpose.\r\n\r\nIn order to **segregate** them, GitLab supports the notion of [Tags](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/#tags). When registering your runners, you shall associate them with _functional_ tag names, that will help developers select the most appropriate one in their `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.\r\n\r\nFor example, let&#39;s imagine you have 4 runners:\r\n\r\n| # | Description           | Proposed Tags                          |\r\n| - | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\r\n| 1 | Linux-based general purpose runners for building code, running tests, ... with transparent access to the internet | `linux`, `general`, `internet`&lt;br&gt; you should also allow this one to run untagged jobs (makes it kind of _default runner_)|\r\n| 2 | Microsoft-based general purpose runners for building your .NET code | `windows`, `general`, `internet`|\r\n| 3 | compute-optimized runners, made for - say - training super-secret neural networks with no access to the internet | `linux`, `compute`, `ml` (for _machine learning_)|\r\n| 4 | runners located behind your DMZ in your on-premises datacenter, used to perform code/infrastructure deployments | `linux`, `deploy`, `datacenter`|\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this setup, a monorepo project with both Java and .NET code may declare the following `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nstages:\r\n  - build\r\n  - test\r\n  - deploy\r\n\r\n# this job declares no tag: will be executed by default runner (#1)\r\njava-build:\r\n  image: maven:3.8-openjdk-11\r\n  stage: build\r\n  script:\r\n    - Java build code here\r\n\r\ndotnet-build:\r\n  image: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0\r\n  stage: build\r\n  tags:\r\n    - windows\r\n    - general\r\n  script:\r\n    - .NET build code here\r\n\r\n# this job declares no tag: will be executed by default runner (#1)\r\njava-test:\r\n  image: maven:3.8-openjdk-11\r\n  stage: test\r\n  script:\r\n    - Java test code here\r\n\r\ndotnet-test:\r\n  image: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0\r\n  stage: test\r\n  tags:\r\n    - windows\r\n    - general\r\n  script:\r\n    - .NET test code here\r\n\r\ndeploy:\r\n  stage: deploy\r\n  tags:\r\n    - deploy\r\n    - datacenter\r\n  script:\r\n    - deployment code here\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. runners have different scopes\r\n\r\nQuoting the [official documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/runners_scope.html):\r\n\r\n&gt; Runners are available based on who you want to have access:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; * [Shared runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/runners_scope.html#shared-runners) are available to all groups and projects in a GitLab instance.\r\n&gt; * [Group runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/runners_scope.html#group-runners) are available to all projects and subgroups in a group.\r\n&gt; * [Specific runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/runners_scope.html#specific-runners) are associated with specific projects. Typically, specific runners are used for one project at a time.\r\n\r\n","title":"How to use Gitlab CI to build a Java Maven project?","body":"<p>Several questions here.</p>\n<p>I'll start answering the Java build question, then the Runners one.</p>\n<h2>Java build</h2>\n<p>I'll start from the most basic Java build configuration, and progressively add features.</p>\n<h3>1. basic Java build</h3>\n<p>This configuration will hopefully run your Maven build (and only the build, explicitly excluding the unit tests):</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-yaml prettyprint-override\"><code>stages:\n  - build\n\njava-build:\n  # select the most appropriate image for your project\n  image: maven:3.8-openjdk-11\n  stage: build\n  script:\n    - mvn package -DskipTests=true\n</code></pre>\n<h3>2. with artifacts, cache and recommended Maven options</h3>\n<p>This new version:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>declares Maven build output as GitLab artifacts (for later use in the downstream pipeline),</li>\n<li>takes benefit of <a href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/caching/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GitLab's cache</a> to cache local Maven repository (in <code>.m2/repository</code>),</li>\n<li>also enforces some recommended Maven options to use in CI/CD context.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre class=\"lang-yaml prettyprint-override\"><code>stages:\n  - build\n\nvariables:\n  # This will suppress any download for dependencies and plugins or upload messages which would clutter the console log.\n  # `showDateTime` will show the passed time in milliseconds.

This way, each Tile has it&#39;s `mousePress` without interfering with one another.\r\n - in `tileClicked()` you&#39;re itereratting through **all** the tiles, from `Tile` which means unecessarily doing the loop for each time: each tile can check it&#39;s own coordinates and position to know if it&#39;s being clicked or not (no need for the loop)\r\n - speaking of checking bounds, checking if `mouseX &lt;

trying to get a `5.8`, I tried 0.9999999999999999 (16 `9` decimal digits).  It ran for over a minute before I killed it.  It must have run up against the precision of a `double` for the cumulative distribution value, so you&#39;ll have to add some kind of guard against this edge case.\r\n\r\nYou may also want to set `lambda` to `5.0` and divide the result by 5 to values in increments of `0.2`, which may widen the probability curve enough to (occasionally) get a `5.8`.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://byjus.com/maths/poisson-distribution/\r\n[2]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Random.html#nextDouble()\r\n[3]: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3693280/generate-a-poisson-random-variable-from-a-standard-uniform-random-variable","title":"Is there a way to generate random numbers with a large range, but tend towards values near 1?
