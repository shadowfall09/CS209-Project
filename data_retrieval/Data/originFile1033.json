I could instead of passing in ScreenGui make a separate object which contains everything I need but I am not sure if generating a new object just for that is more optimized than just saving a larger object in memory aka ScreenGui.</p>\n<pre><code>final BlockingQueue&lt;ScreenGui&gt; blockingQueue;\nfinal UpdateConfigRunnable runnable;\nfinal Thread fileSaverThread;\n\nprivate volatile String fontName;\nprivate volatile int sizeOfFont;\n\npublic ScreenGui() {\n    this.blockingQueue = new LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;&gt;();\n    this.runnable = new UpdateConfigRunnable(blockingQueue);\n    this.fileSaverThread = new Thread(runnable);\n    fileSaverThread.setDaemon(true);\n    fileSaverThread.start();\n}\n\npublic void saveFile() {\n    try {\n        blockingQueue.put(this);\n    } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also since the thread is a daemon thread I assume making an infinite while loop is fine inside of the runnable.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","algorithm","data-structures"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":465573,"reputation":192694,"user_id":869736,"accept_rate":82,"display_name":"Louis Wasserman"},"score":0,"creation_date":1663267137,"post_id":73735892,"comment_id":130205325,"body_markdown":"The root cause is definitely your use of `==` instead of `.equals`, but I feel like there might be a better duplicate.","body":"The root cause is definitely your use of <code>==</code> instead of <code>.equals</code>, but I feel like there might be a better duplicate."},{"owner":{"account_id":22057425,"reputation":135,"user_id":16320675,"display_name":"user16320675"},"score":1,"creation_date":1663267397,"post_id":73735892,"comment_id":130205399,"body_markdown":"BTW many collections - we have no information about what `data` is - have a `contains()` method ....

I have a dataframe containing the following data:</p>\n\n<pre><code>+---+---+\n|  a|  b|\n+---+---+\n|  1|  2|\n|  3|  4|\n+---+---+\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I wrote this as a Parquet file to a subdirectory named <code>x=1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The following code (with a regular non-streaming dataframe) works fine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dataset&lt;Row&gt; data = sparkSession.read()\n  .option(\"basePath\", basePath)\n  .parquet(basePath + \"/x=1\");\n\ndata.show();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This produces the expected result:</p>\n\n<pre><code>+---+---+---+\n|  a|  b|  x|\n+---+---+---+\n|  1|  2|  1|\n|  3|  4|  1|\n+---+---+---+\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, the following (using the Structured Streaming API) doesn't work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>StructType schema = data.schema(); // data as defined above\n\nDataset&lt;Row&gt; streamingData = sparkSession.readStream()\n  .schema(schema)\n  .option(\"basePath\", basePath)\n  .parquet(basePath + \"/x=1\");\n\nstreamingData.writeStream()\n  .trigger(Trigger.Once())\n  .format(\"console\")\n  .start().awaitTermination();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The dataframe, in this case, doesn't contain any rows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>+---+---+---+\n|  a|  b|  x|\n+---+---+---+\n+---+---+---+\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","react-native","gradle"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":47283,"reputation":703817,"user_id":139985,"accept_rate":69,"display_name":"Stephen C"},"score":1,"creation_date":1663249240,"post_id":73732089,"comment_id":130198482,"body_markdown":"Have you tried any of things suggested in the error message?","body":"Have you tried any of things suggested in the error message?"},{"owner":{"account_id":20705974,"reputation":173,"user_id":15203837,"display_name":"Abdur Rahman"},"score":0,"creation_date":1663356795,"post_id":73732089,"comment_id":130228847,"body_markdown":"Did you find any solution?","body":"Did you find any solution?"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":14015074,"reputation":524,"user_id":11135849,"display_name":"Arpit Jindal"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1663260993,"creation_date":1663260993,"answer_id":73734893,"question_id":73732089,"body_markdown":"You need to install Java 11 on your system and update the `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` variables on your system. \r\nIf you are using Windows, you can add or update it under environment variables.

I tried everything from this <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18037576/how-do-i-check-if-the-user-is-pressing-a-key\">post</a> but nothing worked.</p>\n<p>Anyway it may be some weird shenanigans in other parts of my code here:</p>\n<pre><code>import java.awt.Canvas;\nimport java.awt.Color;\nimport java.awt.Graphics;\nimport java.awt.*;\nimport java.awt.event.KeyEvent;\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\n\n\n\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\n\npublic class jWindowComponent extends Canvas {\n\n    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n    private static final int WIDTH = 1000; // Additional pixels needed for the frame\n    private static final int HEIGHT = 1000; // Additional pixels needed for the frame\n\n    @Override\n    public void paint(Graphics g) {\n        super.paint(g);\n        long percent = 0;\n        long percheck = 0;\n        for (int r = 0; r &lt;= 2; r++) {\n            for (int y = 0; y &lt; HEIGHT; y++) {\n                for (int x = 0; x &lt; WIDTH; x++) {\n                    if (Keyboard.isKeyPressed(KeyEvent.VK_A)) {\n                        x=0;\n                        y=0;\n                    }\n                    if (x==y) {\n                        g.setColor(Color.BLACK);\n                    } else {\n                        g.setColor(Color.WHITE);\n                    }\n                    g.fillRect(x, y, 1, 1);\n                }\n                //percent = (long) (y * 100 / HEIGHT);\n                //if (percent == percheck) {\n                //    // block of code to be executed if the condition is true\n                //} else {\n                //    System.out.print(String.format(&quot;\\033[%dA&quot;, 1));\n                //    System.out.print(&quot;\\033[2K&quot;);\n                //    System.out.print(percent);\n                //    System.out.println(&quot;%&quot;);\n                //}\n//\n                //percheck = percent;\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;ColouringPixels - Lesson 9&quot;);\n        frame.setSize(WIDTH, HEIGHT);\n        frame.setResizable(false);\n        frame.add(new jWindowComponent());\n        frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\n        frame.setVisible(true);\n    }\n\n\n    public class Keyboard {\n\n        private static final Map&lt;Integer, Boolean&gt; pressedKeys = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n    \n        static {\n            KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager().addKeyEventDispatcher(event -&gt; {\n                synchronized (Keyboard.class) {\n                    if (event.getID() == KeyEvent.KEY_PRESSED) pressedKeys.put(event.getKeyCode(), true);\n                    else if (event.getID() == KeyEvent.KEY_RELEASED) pressedKeys.put(event.getKeyCode(), false);\n                    return false;\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    \n        public static boolean isKeyPressed(int keyCode) { // Any key code from the KeyEvent class\n            return pressedKeys.getOrDefault(keyCode, false);\n        }\n    }\n    \n} \n</code></pre>\n<p>I use this code to learn new stuff (like i learned how to use jframe to render window and some more stuff that is existent no more in this code). I am relatively new to java so 90% of time i have no idea what am i doing (as you can see). It may be that solution is somewhere on internet but I failed to find it.</p>\n<p>I will be thankful for anything that will solve this problem.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","cardview","radius"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":12134763,"reputation":365,"user_id":8860533,"display_name":"Kush"},"score":0,"creation_date":1526456694,"post_id":50364978,"comment_id":87746294,"body_markdown":"Try

Moving the mouse a lot at a time is fine but doing small drags makes the scrollpane go berserk. </p>\n\n<p>Any ideas how to improve this?</p>\n\n<p>For those who enjoy a visual to help, here is the editor:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HirwT.png\" alt=\"Map Editor\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Addition Notes (Edit):</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I have tried <code>scrollPane.getViewport().setViewPosition(new Point(scrollPane.getViewport().getViewPosition().x + deltaX, scrollPane.getViewport().getViewPosition().y + deltaY));</code></li>\n<li>The dragging is more fidgety when moving the mouse slowly, while big movements are more smooth</li>\n<li>I tried using scrollRectToVisible without luck</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","exception","adb","processbuilder"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":50585,"reputation":39940,"user_id":150978,"accept_rate":78,"display_name":"Robert"},"score":0,"creation_date":1663257037,"post_id":73733049,"comment_id":130201771,"body_markdown":"That may be caused by the restriction Google introduced some time ago: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/behavior-changes-10#execute-permission","body":"That may be caused by the restriction Google introduced some time ago: <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/behavior-changes-10#execute-permission\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">developer.android.com/about/versions/10/&hellip;</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":13354497,"reputation":51,"user_id":15007032,"display_name":"zaxunobi"},"score":0,"creation_date":1663279292,"post_id":73733049,"comment_id":130208662,"body_markdown":"@Robert then how is the developer able to execute it?","body":"@Robert then how is the developer able to execute it?"},{"owner":{"account_id":50585,"reputation":39940,"user_id":150978,"accept_rate":78,"display_name":"Robert"},"score":0,"creation_date":1663312408,"post_id":73733049,"comment_id":130213942,"body_markdown":"Potential duplicate of https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63800440/android-cant-execute-process-for-android-api-29-android-10-from-lib-arch","body":"Potential duplicate of <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63800440/android-cant-execute-process-for-android-api-29-android-10-from-lib-arch\" title=\"android cant execute process for android api 29 android 10 from lib arch\">stackoverflow.com/questions/63800440/&hellip;</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":13354497,"reputation":51,"user_id":15007032,"display_name":"zaxunobi"},"score":0,"creation_date":1663403137,"post_id":73733049,"comment_id":130235197,"body_markdown":"@Robert thank you for pointing that out!
