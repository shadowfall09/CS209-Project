Almost all pages are static, but some text on 2 pages in PDF file has to be changed depending on today&#39;s date and several parameters (like name and number). That&#39;s why I think it&#39;s good not to generate full PDF file from scratch, but to have template inside my project and then open it, modify it and save it as a new file. What is the best solution to make changes in template file in Java to send it to frontend? I considered 2 approaches: 1) to have template as PDF file, edit it and send to frontend and 2) to have template as DOCX file, edit it, convert to PDF and send it to frontend side. Probably the first way is not perfect, because as I understood we can&#39;t change text in PDF, only add white rectangle and then add text on it, and this solution will be explicit when user highlights text and also text width will be not expanded (all alignments will be the same not depending of inserted word lenght). Am I right or not? The second way looks better, I can change text in DOCX file via `poi`, below I&#39;m leaving my method code and libraries dependencies, but I faced with issue linked to convertion from DOCX to PDF in Java - when I use library `fr.opensagres.xdocreport:fr.opensagres.poi.xwpf.converter.pdf:2.0.4` I get PDF with content, which has some differences compared to content in DOCX file - watermarks in the background dissapear, sometimes sudden characters appear in list numbers and sometimes text overlaps each other. Are there some better libraries to convert DOCX to PDF with sufficient accuracy in Java? Or may be it is a bad approach and are there better solution, for example to use hybrid approach of several ways? I shall appreciate all your ideas. Share please your experience with PDF files edting.

Almost all pages are static, but some text on 2 pages in PDF file has to be changed depending on today's date and several parameters (like name and number). That's why I think it's good not to generate full PDF file from scratch, but to have template inside my project and then open it, modify it and save it as a new file. What is the best solution to make changes in template file in Java to send it to frontend? I considered 2 approaches: 1) to have template as PDF file, edit it and send to frontend and 2) to have template as DOCX file, edit it, convert to PDF and send it to frontend side. Probably the first way is not perfect, because as I understood we can't change text in PDF, only add white rectangle and then add text on it, and this solution will be explicit when user highlights text and also text width will be not expanded (all alignments will be the same not depending of inserted word lenght). Am I right or not? The second way looks better, I can change text in DOCX file via <code>poi</code>, below I'm leaving my method code and libraries dependencies, but I faced with issue linked to convertion from DOCX to PDF in Java - when I use library <code>fr.opensagres.xdocreport:fr.opensagres.poi.xwpf.converter.pdf:2.0.4</code> I get PDF with content, which has some differences compared to content in DOCX file - watermarks in the background dissapear, sometimes sudden characters appear in list numbers and sometimes text overlaps each other. Are there some better libraries to convert DOCX to PDF with sufficient accuracy in Java? Or may be it is a bad approach and are there better solution, for example to use hybrid approach of several ways? I shall appreciate all your ideas. Share please your experience with PDF files edting.

If you want a user to be only allowed an action once, you need:\r\n\r\n1. To be able to identify the user, by signing them in with/to [Firebase Authentication][1].\r\n2. A data structure that allows checking if they&#39;ve taken the action before. That would typically be a map with the UID as the key, as that&#39;s the only way you can ensure uniqueness.\r\n\r\nSince you want to track upvotes and downvotes separately, that&#39;d be:\r\n```\r\nupvotes: {\r\n  &quot;uid1&quot;: true,\r\n  &quot;uid2&quot;: true\r\n},\r\ndownvotes: {\r\n  &quot;uid3&quot;: true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the rest of your requirements are a bunch of [security rules]() on this structure.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor example, **a user is allowed to cast a vote for themselves**, which would look like this:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  &quot;rules&quot;: {\r\n    ...\r\n    &quot;upvotes&quot;: {\r\n      &quot;$uid&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;.write&quot;: &quot;auth.uid === $uid&quot;\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    &quot;downvotes&quot;: {\r\n      &quot;$uid&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;.write&quot;: &quot;auth.uid === $uid&quot;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNext up, **a user can only upvote *or* downvote, not both**, which is something like this:\r\n```\r\n&quot;upvotes&quot;: {\r\n  &quot;$uid&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;.write&quot;: &quot;auth.uid === $uid\r\n            &amp;&amp; !newData.parent().parent().child(&#39;downvotes&#39;).child(auth.uid).exists()&quot;\r\n  }\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then of course the equivalent rule under `downvotes` too.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWith the above rules, a user can **cast an upvote** with this JSON patch (which you could build as a `Map` in Android):\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  &quot;upvotes/uid1&quot;: true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA downvote would be:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  &quot;downvotes/uid1&quot;: true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that would get rejected if they&#39;d already upvoted, so you can switch their upvote to a downvote by doing this (single) write operation:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  &quot;upvotes/uid1&quot;: null,\r\n  &quot;downvotes/uid1&quot;: true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `null` here deletes their upvote, and the `true` writes the downvote, both happening as a single operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Storing and securing the counters\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally that gets us to the counting that you asked about, which is a separate topic from uniqueness. Storing the count is optional now, as the information is already present in the number of UIDs. But it is a good optimization as without a stored counter, users would have to download all UID values to count them.\r\n\r\nSo the data structure becomes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nupvotes: {\r\n  &quot;uid1&quot;: true,\r\n  &quot;uid2&quot;: true\r\n},\r\nupvoteCount: 2,\r\ndownvotes: {\r\n  &quot;uid3&quot;: true\r\n},\r\ndownvoteCount: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that you have the data structure and we&#39;ve seen the transitions, it becomes a matter of ensuring that the change in count matches the vote being cast.\r\n\r\nFirst example of that is the upvote snippet we saw above: **you can increase the upvote count when you cast an upvote**. In rules\r\n```\r\n&quot;upvoteCount&quot;: {\r\n  &quot;.write&quot;: &quot;(\r\n              newData.val() = data.val() + 1\r\n              newData.parent().parent().child(&#39;upvotes&#39;).child(auth.uid).exists()\r\n             &amp;&amp; !data.parent().parent().child(&#39;upvotes&#39;).child(auth.uid).exists()\r\n            )&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope this expression makes sense if you read the definition above it: \r\n\r\n1. the user can only increase the upvote count by 1, \r\n2. and only if they added their UID to the `upvotes` list, \r\n3. and if it didn&#39;t exist there before\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll similarly need to handle decreasing the upvote count if they remove their vote, and then also handle the downvotes counts. The rules for these are all similar, but separate.\r\n\r\nOnce you have that, the final step is to enhance the rules for `upvotes` and `downvotes` to also require that the user updates the count when they cast a vote. **When a user casts a vote, they also have to update the count**. So that&#39;d be the inverse of the rules we just saw:\r\n\r\n    &quot;upvotes&quot;: {\r\n      &quot;$uid&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;.write&quot;: &quot;auth.uid === $uid\r\n                &amp;&amp; newData.exists() \r\n                &amp;&amp; !data.exists()\r\n                &amp;&amp;  newData.parent().parent().child(&#39;upvoteCount&#39;).val() == \r\n                       data.parent().parent().child(&#39;upvoteCount&#39;).val() + 1\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth","title":"How to create a secure like counter in Firebase Realtime Database","body":"<p>It always starts with having the right data structure.

Plenty of native applications already behave this way:  dragging is a move operation by default, and holding down a certain modifier key, whether before the drag or during the drag, changes the drag to a copy operation.  As of JavaFX 19, there still is no way to programmatically modify the transfer mode of a native platform drag-and-drop once it’s in progress. (By “native platform drag-and-drop” I mean a drag-and-drop started with [Node.startDragAndDrop](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/19/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/Node.html#startDragAndDrop(javafx.scene.input.TransferMode...)).)\r\n\r\nHowever, you mentioned in a comment that your drag-and-drop is only within your application.  This means you can forego the native platform functionality, and do it yourself with only a little more work, using a non-native JavaFX drag-and-drop which is started by [Node.startFullDrag](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/19/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/Node.html#startFullDrag()).\r\n\r\n(Why the JavaFX calls a native platform drag-and-drop just “drag and drop” and calls a non-native, JavaFX-implemented drag-and-drop “full drag and drop” is beyond me.  I had to read the javadocs several times before I was able to keep the nomenclature straight in my head.)\r\n\r\nWhile native platform drag-and-drop uses [DragEvents](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/19/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/input/DragEvent.html), the JavaFX-implemented drag-and-drop uses [MouseDragEvents](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/19/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/input/MouseDragEvent.html).

Whether that information will hold true in the long term, I have no idea.  The good news is, the cursors appear to be ordinary .png files.  The bad news is, their hotspots are defined in [binary plist](https://opensource.apple.com/source/CF/CF-1153.18/CFBinaryPList.c.auto.html) files in the same directory as each .png file.\r\n* JavaFX for Linux uses Gnome/GTK, so it makes sense to use Gnome cursors.  They are in the `cursors` subdirectory of the active theme, as [Xcursor](https://linux.die.net/man/3/xcursor) image files;  for my code below, I used [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) to convert them to PNG files.  (I couldn’t find any other tools capable of reading Xcursor files.)  Finding the current Gnome theme is a bit complex;  the full [icon theme spec](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html) depends on the [XDG base directory spec](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) and a command like `gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme` to find the current theme’s name.  Parsing Xcursor images in Java is not impossible, but I found it needed a nontrivial amount of code.\r\n* Windows drag-and-drop cursors [are buried in ole32.dll](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49487213/1831987).  A .dll file follows the [Portable Executable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format) format.  I found it fairly difficult to read the file using Java, as the relative offsets’ bases aren’t well explained (and the rest of the Internet seems even more confused than I was), but I did get there eventually.

Use this only to retrieve an instance that you assume exists, where non-existence would be an actual error.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why you need to use a `finally` block to close the `Session`, like this:\r\n\r\n    public static synchronized Object getObjectById (Class objclass, Long id) {    \r\n         Session session = null;\r\n         try {\r\n             session = sessionFactory.openSession();\r\n             return session.load(objclass, id);\r\n         } finally {\r\n             if(session != null) {\r\n                 session.close(); \r\n             }\r\n         }\r\n     }\r\n\r\nPreventing multi-thread access\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn your case, you wanted to make sure only one thread gets access to that particular entity.\r\n\r\nBut the `synchronized` keyword only prevents two threads from calling the `getObjectById` concurrently. If the two threads call this method one after the other, you will still have two threads using this entity.\r\n\r\nSo, if you want to lock a given database object so no other thread can modify it, then you need to use database locks.\r\n\r\nThe `synchronized` keyword only works in a single JVM. If you have multiple web nodes, this will not prevent multi-thread access across multiple JVMs.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is use [`LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_READ` or `LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE`](https://vladmihalcea.com/hibernate-locking-patterns-how-do-pessimistic_read-and-pessimistic_write-work/) while applying the changes to the DB, like this:\r\n\r\n\tSession session = null;\r\n\tEntityTransaction tx = null;\r\n\t\r\n\ttry {\r\n\t\tsession = sessionFactory.openSession();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\ttx = session.getTransaction();\r\n\t\ttx.begin();\r\n\r\n\t\tPost post = session.find(\r\n\t\t\tPost.class, \r\n\t\t\tid, \r\n\t\t\tLockModeType.LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_READ\r\n\t\t);\r\n\r\n\t\tpost.setTitle(&quot;High-Performance Java Perisstence&quot;);\r\n\r\n\t\ttx.commit();\r\n\t} catch(Exception e) {\r\n        LOGGER.error(&quot;Post entity could not be changed&quot;, e);\r\n        if(tx != null) {\r\n\t\t\ttx.rollback(); \r\n\t\t}\r\n    } finally {\r\n\t\tif(session != null) {\r\n\t\t\tsession.close(); \r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nSo, this is what I did:\r\n\r\n- I created a new `EntityTransaction` and started a new database transaction\r\n- I loaded the `Post` entity while holding a lock on the associated database record\r\n- I changed the `Post` entity and committed the transaction\r\n- In the case of an `Exception` being thrown, I rolled back the transaction","title":"How do synchronized static methods work in Java and can I use it for loading Hibernate entities?","body":"<h2>How the <code>synchronized</code> Java keyword works</h2>\n<p>When you add the <code>synchronized</code> keyword to a static method, the method can only be called by a single thread at a time.</p>\n<p>In your case, every method call will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>create a new <code>SessionFactory</code></li>\n<li>create a new <code>Session</code></li>\n<li>fetch the entity</li>\n<li>return the entity back to the caller</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, these were your requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I want this to prevent access to info to the same DB instance.</li>\n<li>preventing <code>getObjectById</code> being called for all classes when it is called by a particular class</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, even if the <code>getObjectById</code> method is thread-safe, the implementation is wrong.</p>\n<h2><code>SessionFactory</code> best practices</h2>\n<p>The <code>SessionFactory</code> is thread-safe, and it's a very expensive object to create as it needs to parse the entity classes and build the internal entity metamodel representation.</p>\n<p>So, you shouldn't create the <code>SessionFactory</code> on every <code>getObjectById</code> method call.</p>\n<p>Instead, you should create a singleton instance for it.</p>\n<pre><code>private static final SessionFactory sessionFactory = new Configuration()\n    .configure()\n    .buildSessionFactory();\n</code></pre>\n<h2>The <code>Session</code> should always be closed</h2>\n<p>You didn't close the <code>Session</code> in a <code>finally</code> block, and this can leak database resources if an exception is thrown when loading the entity.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.4/javadocs/org/hibernate/Session.html#load-java.lang.Class-java.io.Serializable-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Session.load</code> method JavaDoc</a> might throw a <code>HibernateException</code> if the entity cannot be found in the database.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You should not use this method to determine if an instance exists (use <code>get()</code> instead).

If you have multiple web nodes, this will not prevent multi-thread access across multiple JVMs.</p>\n<p>What you need to do is use <a href=\"https://vladmihalcea.com/hibernate-locking-patterns-how-do-pessimistic_read-and-pessimistic_write-work/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_READ</code> or <code>LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE</code></a> while applying the changes to the DB, like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Session session = null;\nEntityTransaction tx = null;\n\ntry {\n    session = sessionFactory.openSession();\n    \n    tx = session.getTransaction();\n    tx.begin();\n\n    Post post = session.find(\n        Post.class, \n        id, \n        LockModeType.LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_READ\n    );\n\n    post.setTitle(&quot;High-Performance Java Perisstence&quot;);\n\n    tx.commit();\n} catch(Exception e) {\n    LOGGER.error(&quot;Post entity could not be changed&quot;, e);\n    if(tx != null) {\n        tx.rollback(); \n    }\n} finally {\n    if(session != null) {\n        session.close(); \n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, this is what I did:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I created a new <code>EntityTransaction</code> and started a new database transaction</li>\n<li>I loaded the <code>Post</code> entity while holding a lock on the associated database record</li>\n<li>I changed the <code>Post</code> entity and committed the transaction</li>\n<li>In the case of an <code>Exception</code> being thrown, I rolled back the transaction</li>\n</ul>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":16970,"reputation":5674,"user_id":37519,"accept_rate":78,"display_name":"tomato"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":202564,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":188,"accepted_answer_id":579221,"answer_count":8,"score":188,"last_activity_date":1677195643,"creation_date":1235416036,"question_id":578904,"body_markdown":"If I have a util class with static methods that will call Hibernate functions to accomplish basic data access.

I suspect that you will have a package like this to perform all the necessary operations on S3:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    //---------------------------------------------------------------------     \n    // Amazon S3\n    //---------------------------------------------------------------------     \n        class S3 extends AmazonS3Client\n         {final String bucket;\n          S3(String u, String p, String Bucket)\n           {super(new BasicAWSCredentials(u, p));\n            bucket = Bucket;\n           }\n          boolean put(String k, String v)      \n           {try \n             {final ByteArrayInputStream b = new ByteArrayInputStream(v.toString().getBytes());\n              putObject(bucket, k, b, new ObjectMetadata());\n              setObjectAcl(bucket, k, CannedAccessControlList.PublicRead);  // Has to be here to allow change to reduced redundancy\n              changeObjectStorageClass(bucket, k, StorageClass.ReducedRedundancy);\n              setObjectAcl(bucket, k, CannedAccessControlList.PublicRead);  // Has to be repeated because it is now a new object again\n              return true; \n             }\n            catch(Exception e) {log(\"Cannot put \"+bucket+\"/\"+k+\" to S3 because \"+e);}\n            return false; \n           }\n          String get(String k) \n           {try \n             {final S3Object f = getObject(bucket, k);\n              final BufferedInputStream i = new BufferedInputStream(f.getObjectContent());  \n              final StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder(); \n              final byte[]b = new byte[1024];\n              for(int n = i.read(b); n != -1; n = i.read(b)) {s.append(new String(b, 0, n));}\n              return s.toString(); \n             }\n            catch(Exception e) {log(\"Cannot get \"+bucket+\"/\"+k+\" from S3 because \"+e);}\n            return null; \n           }\n          String[]list(String d) \n           {try \n             {final ObjectListing l = listObjects(bucket, d);\n              final List&lt;S3ObjectSummary&gt; L = l.getObjectSummaries(); \n              final int n = L.size();\n              final String[]s = new String[n];  \n              for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)\n               {final S3ObjectSummary k = L.get(i);\n                s[i] = k.getKey();\n               } \n              return s; \n             }\n            catch(Exception e) {log(\"Cannot list \"+bucket+\"/\"+d+\" on S3 because \"+e);}\n            return new String[]{}; \n           }\n         }\n       }\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1421652,"reputation":571,"user_id":1346212,"display_name":"kodlan"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":326,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":18600943,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1677192458,"creation_date":1334915596,"question_id":10243935,"body_markdown":"I use Amazon S3 to store images used in my other Java applications.

I have added ad open ads, interstitial ads and banner ads to my app and external links to my app such as private polices, my app page and rating section of the app page, is this code enough to approve of all these things in my app?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","amazon-s3"],"owner":{"account_id":8486120,"reputation":128,"user_id":6364177,"display_name":"Houssam Rafiki"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":178,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1677191622,"creation_date":1654255871,"question_id":72488957,"body_markdown":"I have versioning enabled in my bucket, and when I update only metadata of a s3 object using CopyObjectRequest S3 create me a new version of the file with the new metadata, but I don&#39;t want this.\r\nHow can I just edit metadata without creating a new version and without disabling versioning ?\r\n\r\nI am using S3 Java 2 sdk\r\n\r\n```\r\nCopyObjectRequest request = CopyObjectRequest.builder()\r\n        .sourceBucket(&quot;myBucketName&quot;)\r\n        .sourceKey(&quot;myObjectKey&quot;)\r\n        .destinationBucket(&quot;myBucketName&quot;)\r\n        .destinationKey(&quot;myObjectKey&quot;)\r\n        .metadata(newMetadata)\r\n        .metadataDirective(MetadataDirective.REPLACE)\r\n        .build();\r\n```","title":"S3 java client update object metadata without creating a new version","body":"<p>I have versioning enabled in my bucket, and when I update only metadata of a s3 object using CopyObjectRequest S3 create me a new version of the file with the new metadata, but I don't want this.\nHow can I just edit metadata without creating a new version and without disabling versioning ?</p>\n<p>I am using S3 Java 2 sdk</p>\n<pre><code>CopyObjectRequest request = CopyObjectRequest.builder()\n        .sourceBucket(&quot;myBucketName&quot;)\n        .sourceKey(&quot;myObjectKey&quot;)\n        .destinationBucket(&quot;myBucketName&quot;)\n        .destinationKey(&quot;myObjectKey&quot;)\n        .metadata(newMetadata)\n        .metadataDirective(MetadataDirective.REPLACE)\n        .build();\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","maven","lombok"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":-1,"reputation":1,"user_id":-1,"display_name":"Community"},"score":0,"creation_date":1677223092,"post_id":75551000,"comment_id":133298946,"body_markdown":"Please edit the question to limit it to a specific problem with enough detail to identify an adequate answer.","body":"Please edit the question to limit it to a specific problem with enough detail to identify an adequate answer."}],"owner":{"account_id":24906425,"reputation":1,"user_id":18776436,"display_name":"babycoder97"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":73,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1677191614,"creation_date":1677191614,"question_id":75551000,"body_markdown":"Lombok has always worked fine for me on vs code until yesterday I suddenly got a bunch of errors related to lombok and when I looked at my main model I saw that the package lombok didn&#39;t exist.

Try it!</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":21636928,"reputation":15,"user_id":15959884,"display_name":"Michele Raso"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":974,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":75546264,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1677189817,"creation_date":1677152077,"question_id":75544272,"body_markdown":"I am implementing a post with `restTemplate`, with body an object representing a fields of a `json` and I would like the answer with an `object` representing the `json` fields of the answer itself.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `json` is this:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    &quot;content&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;support-callmebackmodals-view_web&quot;,\r\n        &quot;data&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;channel&quot;: &quot;web&quot;,\r\n            &quot;productName&quot;: &quot;book&quot;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe class that represents it is this:\r\n```\r\n@Getter\r\n@Setter\r\n@NoArgsConstructor\r\npublic class Request {\r\n    Con ContentObject;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`ConClass` contains &quot;content&quot; of `json`, content contains name and `DataClass` ecc.\r\n\r\nThe response translated into object I created is:\r\n```\r\n@Getter\r\n@Setter\r\n@NoArgsConstructor\r\n@ToString\r\npublic class AssistenzaResponse {\r\n    \r\n    private boolean success;\r\n    private String error;\r\n    Results results;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Getter\r\n@Setter\r\n@NoArgsConstructor\r\npublic class Results {\r\n\r\n    Content content;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Getter\r\n@Setter\r\n@NoArgsConstructor\r\npublic class Content {\r\n    Meta meta;\r\n    private String name;\r\n    private String html;\r\n    private float duration;\r\n    private float statusCode;\r\n    private boolean success;\r\n    private String error;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Getter\r\n@Setter\r\n@NoArgsConstructor\r\npublic class Meta {\r\n    private String src;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy `service` is this:\r\n```\r\n@Service\r\npublic class AssistenzaService {\r\n    public AssistenzaResponse getUno() throws IOException {\r\n\r\n        String url = &quot;https://support.aasdt/batch&quot;;\r\n\r\n\r\n        org.apache.http.client.HttpClient client = HttpClientBuilder.create().build();\r\n\r\n        Request request1 = new Request();\r\n        Con con = new Con();\r\n        con.setName(&quot;support-callmebackmodals-view_web&quot;);\r\n\r\n        Data data = new Data();\r\n        data.setChannel(&quot;web&quot;);\r\n        data.setProductName(&quot;LibrettoMinori&quot;);\r\n        con.setData(data);\r\n        RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();\r\n        request1.setContentObject(con);\r\n        HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();\r\n        headers.set(&quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;application/json&quot;);\r\n        headers.set(&quot;Accept&quot;, &quot;application/json&quot;);\r\n        HttpEntity&lt;Request&gt; entity = new HttpEntity&lt;&gt;(request1, headers);\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n            ResponseEntity&lt;AssistenzaResponse&gt; response = restTemplate.exchange(url, HttpMethod.POST, entity, AssistenzaResponse.class);\r\n\r\n            return response.getBody();\r\n\r\n        } catch (Exception e) {\r\n            System.out.println(e.getMessage());\r\n        }\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the answer is not what I expect, because it returns:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    &quot;success&quot;: true,\r\n    &quot;error&quot;: null,\r\n    &quot;results&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;results&quot;: null\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead if I use:        \r\n```\r\nResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; response = restTemplate.exchange(url,HttpMethod.POST, entity, String.class);         \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe response is correct and it is: \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    &quot;success&quot;: true,\r\n    &quot;error&quot;: null,\r\n    &quot;results&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;content&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;support-callmebackmodals-view_web&quot;,\r\n            &quot;html&quot;: &quot;&quot;,\r\n            &quot;meta&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;src&quot;: &quot;/support/client.js&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            &quot;duration&quot;: 7.694401,\r\n            &quot;statusCode&quot;: 200,\r\n            &quot;success&quot;: true,\r\n            &quot;error&quot;: null\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy don&#39;t I get the exact answer using the answer object I created?
