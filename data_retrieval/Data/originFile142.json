The class Exception is a very general exception class and can be used to wrap internal low level exceptions. You would better create a custom exception and wrap inside it. But, and a big one - Never ever obscure in underlying original root cause. For ex, `Don&#39;t ever` do following - \r\n\r\n    try {\r\n         attemptLogin(userCredentials);\r\n    } catch (SQLException sqle) {\r\n         throw new LoginFailureException(&quot;Cannot login!!&quot;); //&lt;-- Eat away original root cause, thus obscuring underlying problem.\r\n    }\r\n\r\nInstead do following:\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n         attemptLogin(userCredentials);\r\n    } catch (SQLException sqle) {\r\n         throw new LoginFailureException(sqle); //&lt;-- Wrap original exception to pass on root cause upstairs!.\r\n    }\r\n\r\nEating away original root cause buries the actual cause beyond recovery is a nightmare for production support teams where all they are given access to is application logs and error messages.\r\nAlthough the latter is a better design but many people don&#39;t use it often because developers just fail to pass on the underlying message to caller. So make a firm note: `Always pass on the actual exception` back whether or not wrapped in any application specific exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; On try-catching `RuntimeExceptions`\r\n\r\n`RuntimeException`s as a general rule should not be try-catched. They generally signal a programming error and should be left alone. Instead the programmer should check the error condition before invoking some code which might result in a `RuntimeException`. For ex:\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n        setStatusMessage(&quot;Hello Mr. &quot; + userObject.getName() + &quot;, Welcome to my site!);\r\n    } catch (NullPointerException npe) {\r\n       sendError(&quot;Sorry, your userObject was null. Please contact customer care.&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is a bad programming practice. Instead a null-check should have been done like - \r\n\r\n    if (userObject != null) {\r\n        setStatusMessage(&quot;Hello Mr. &quot; + userObject.getName() + &quot;, Welome to my site!);\r\n    } else {\r\n       sendError(&quot;Sorry, your userObject was null. Please contact customer care.&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut there are times when such error checking is expensive such as number formatting, consider this - \r\n\r\n    try {\r\n        String userAge = (String)request.getParameter(&quot;age&quot;);\r\n        userObject.setAge(Integer.parseInt(strUserAge));\r\n    } catch (NumberFormatException npe) {\r\n       sendError(&quot;Sorry, Age is supposed to be an Integer. Please try again.&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere pre-invocation error checking is not worth the effort because it essentially means to duplicate all the string-to-integer conversion code inside parseInt() method - and is error prone if implemented by a developer. So it is better to just do away with try-catch. \r\n\r\nSo `NullPointerException` and `NumberFormatException` are both `RuntimeExceptions`, catching a `NullPointerException` should replaced with a graceful null-check while I recommend catching a `NumberFormatException` explicitly to avoid possible introduction of error prone code.","title":"Understanding checked vs unchecked exceptions in Java","body":"<ol>\n<li><p>Is the above considered to be a checked exception?\nNo\nThe fact that you are handling an exception does not make it a <code>Checked Exception</code> if it is a <code>RuntimeException</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Is <code>RuntimeException</code> an <code>unchecked exception</code>?\nYes</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><code>Checked Exceptions</code> are <code>subclasses</code> of <code>java.lang.Exception</code>\n<code>Unchecked Exceptions</code> are <code>subclasses</code> of <code>java.lang.RuntimeException</code></p>\n\n<p>Calls throwing checked exceptions need to be enclosed in a try{} block or handled in a level above in the caller of the method.

But when doing so, the authentication is null so it won&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nUserController.java\r\n\r\n    package com.pablo.portfolio.youtubeclone.controller;\r\n    \r\n    @RestController\r\n    @RequestMapping(&quot;/api/user&quot;)\r\n    @RequiredArgsConstructor\r\n    public class UserController {\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        private final UserRegistrationService userRegistrationService;\r\n        private final UserService userService;\r\n    \r\n        @GetMapping(&quot;/register&quot;)\r\n        @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.OK)\r\n        public String register(Authentication authentication){\r\n    \r\n            Jwt jwt = (Jwt)authentication.getPrincipal();\r\n            userRegistrationService.registerUser(jwt.getTokenValue());\r\n            return &quot;User registered successfully&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nSecurityConfig.java\r\n\r\n    package com.pablo.portfolio.youtubeclone.config;\r\n    \r\n    @Configuration\r\n    @EnableWebSecurity\r\n    public class SecurityConfig {\r\n        @Value(&quot;${spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer.uri}&quot;)\r\n        private String issuer;\r\n        @Value(&quot;${auth0.audience}&quot;)\r\n        private String audience;\r\n        @Bean\r\n        public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\r\n    \r\n            http\r\n                    .csrf()\r\n                    .disable().authorizeRequests()\r\n                    .requestMatchers(&quot;/&quot;).permitAll()\r\n                    .requestMatchers(&quot;/api/videos/&quot;,&quot;/save-video-details/&quot;,&quot;/upload-video/&quot;,&quot;/thumbnail/&quot;).authenticated()\r\n                    .requestMatchers(&quot;/api/private-scoped&quot;).hasAuthority(&quot;SCOPE_read:messages&quot;)\r\n                    .and().cors()\r\n                    .and().oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();\r\n            return http.build();\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Bean\r\n        CorsConfigurationSource corsConfigurationSource() {\r\n            CorsConfiguration configuration = new CorsConfiguration();\r\n            configuration.setAllowedOrigins(Collections.singletonList(&quot;http://localhost:4200&quot;));\r\n            configuration.setAllowedMethods(Arrays.asList(&quot;GET&quot;,&quot;POST&quot;, &quot;PUT&quot;, &quot;DELETE&quot;, &quot;PATCH&quot;, &quot;OPTIONS&quot;));\r\n            configuration.setExposedHeaders(Arrays.asList(&quot;Authorization&quot;, &quot;content-type&quot;));\r\n            configuration.setAllowedHeaders(Arrays.asList(&quot;Authorization&quot;, &quot;content-type&quot;));\r\n            UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource source = new UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource();\r\n            source.registerCorsConfiguration(&quot;/**&quot;, configuration);\r\n            return source;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        @Bean\r\n        JwtDecoder jwtDecoder(){\r\n            NimbusJwtDecoder jwtDecoder = (NimbusJwtDecoder)\r\n                    JwtDecoders.fromOidcIssuerLocation(issuer);\r\n    \r\n            OAuth2TokenValidator&lt;Jwt&gt; audienceValidator = new AudienceValidator(audience);\r\n            OAuth2TokenValidator&lt;Jwt&gt; withIssuer = JwtValidators.createDefaultWithIssuer(issuer);\r\n            OAuth2TokenValidator&lt;Jwt&gt; withAudience = new DelegatingOAuth2TokenValidator&lt;&gt;(withIssuer, audienceValidator);\r\n    \r\n            jwtDecoder.setJwtValidator(withAudience);\r\n    \r\n            return jwtDecoder;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAlso, i checked the token o jwt.io and its valid.\r\nHere&#39;s the response:\r\n\r\n    Header:\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;alg&quot;: &quot;RS256&quot;,\r\n      &quot;typ&quot;: &quot;JWT&quot;,\r\n      &quot;kid&quot;: &quot;7_mQttmzor-VMdGDXMEKN&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Payload:\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;iss&quot;: &quot;https://dev-i63rcznjs255jxgf.us.auth0.com/&quot;,\r\n      &quot;sub&quot;: &quot;google-oauth2|113855475209558231767&quot;,\r\n      &quot;aud&quot;: [\r\n        &quot;http://localhost:8080&quot;,\r\n        &quot;https://dev-i63rcznjs255jxgf.us.auth0.com/userinfo&quot;\r\n      ],\r\n      &quot;iat&quot;: 1681740331,\r\n      &quot;exp&quot;: 1681826731,\r\n      &quot;azp&quot;: &quot;NJbox1ptzDdadd1Zo9mlBvtkElgge59v&quot;,\r\n      &quot;scope&quot;: &quot;openid profile email&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: FUll log\r\n\r\n    2023-04-19T22:07:32.963-03:00 TRACE 1909589 --- [           main] eGlobalAuthenticationAutowiredConfigurer : Eagerly initializing {securityConfig=com.pablo.portfolio.youtubeclone.config.SecurityConfig$$SpringCGLIB$$0@61d2f267}\r\n    2023-04-19T22:07:32.964-03:00 DEBUG 1909589 --- [           main] swordEncoderAuthenticationManagerBuilder : No authenticationProviders and no parentAuthenticationManager defined.

However, when trying to call the endpoint using postman and sending my token as a Bearer token, i do receive the error i sent above.\nAnd i can't even debug the UserController ; even setting the breakpoints, when i call the endpoint   i don't know what happens but i just receive the error.

Drop the existing table and try to create a new table via Hibernate and verify once again.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLet me show how I tested to see it working. I started from the very beginning of setting up the Oracle DB on my system.\r\n\r\n**Steps that will help you to reach to your solution:**\r\n\r\n**Note:** I&#39;m using **Oracle DB 23c**, **MacOS** &amp; **JDK 17.0.8** to prove my point.\r\n\r\n**You can use any version of Oracle DB.** For Windows, I guess Oracle DB installer is present. So, you can skip the VM based setup.\r\n\r\nOracle doesn&#39;t have installer support for MacOS. So, for that reason, I had to do in this way.\r\n\r\nFor MacOS way:\r\n\r\n- Start with installing **Oracle Virtual Box** on the system. You can download from [here][1] based on the OS.\r\n\r\n- Then, download the installation **Oracle Database 23c Free - Developer Release VirtualBox Appliance (.vba)** from there official website [here][2]. \r\n\r\n   This `.vba` file provides pre-configured Oracle software for your use.\r\n\r\n   The above virtual machine contains:\r\n\r\n      1. Oracle Linux 8.7\r\n      2. Oracle Database 23.2 Free - Developer Release for Linux x86-64\r\n      3. Oracle REST Data Services 23.1\r\n      4. Oracle SQLcl 23.1\r\n      5. Oracle APEX 22.2\r\n\r\n- You have to follow the setup video [here][3] from Database Star will help you to setup.\r\n\r\n- After, you done with this, install **Oracle SQL Developer** on to your system from [here][1].\r\n\r\n- Also start the VM containing Oracle DB hosted on linux. It will start the oracle DB as well.\r\n\r\n- Start the Oracle SQL Developer and connect to the VM oracle DB and test the connection as successful or not.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][4]][4]\r\n\r\nFor Oracle 23c, the default user - `hr` and password - `oracle` and pluggable db - `freepdb1`\r\n\r\nYou are done now with DB setup.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nNow, coming to codebase:\r\n\r\nI have created a sample spring boot project name &#39;demo&#39;

The controller logic looks suspicious. Please verify your controller and entity.</p>\n<p>Also, check the DB Table. Drop the existing table and try to create a new table via Hibernate and verify once again.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Let me show how I tested to see it working. I started from the very beginning of setting up the Oracle DB on my system.</p>\n<p><strong>Steps that will help you to reach to your solution:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm using <strong>Oracle DB 23c</strong>, <strong>MacOS</strong> &amp; <strong>JDK 17.0.8</strong> to prove my point.</p>\n<p><strong>You can use any version of Oracle DB.</strong> For Windows, I guess Oracle DB installer is present. So, you can skip the VM based setup.</p>\n<p>Oracle doesn't have installer support for MacOS. So, for that reason, I had to do in this way.</p>\n<p>For MacOS way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Start with installing <strong>Oracle Virtual Box</strong> on the system. You can download from <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/technologies/download/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> based on the OS.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Then, download the installation <strong>Oracle Database 23c Free - Developer Release VirtualBox Appliance (.vba)</strong> from there official website <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/databaseappdev-vm.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This <code>.vba</code> file provides pre-configured Oracle software for your use.</p>\n<p>The above virtual machine contains:</p>\n<pre><code>1. Oracle Linux 8.7\n2. Oracle Database 23.2 Free - Developer Release for Linux x86-64\n3. Oracle REST Data Services 23.1\n4. Oracle SQLcl 23.1\n5. Oracle APEX 22.2\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>You have to follow the setup video <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ssef6bjPpZE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> from Database Star will help you to setup.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>After, you done with this, install <strong>Oracle SQL Developer</strong> on to your system from <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/technologies/download/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Also start the VM containing Oracle DB hosted on linux. It will start the oracle DB as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Start the Oracle SQL Developer and connect to the VM oracle DB and test the connection as successful or not.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JMfpg.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JMfpg.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>For Oracle 23c, the default user - <code>hr</code> and password - <code>oracle</code> and pluggable db - <code>freepdb1</code></p>\n<p>You are done now with DB setup.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Now, coming to codebase:</p>\n<p>I have created a sample spring boot project name 'demo' with this structure.</p>\n<pre><code>.\n├── HELP.md\n├── mvnw\n├── mvnw.cmd\n├── pom.xml\n├── src\n│   ├── main\n│   │   ├── java\n│   │   │   └── com\n│   │   │       └── example\n│   │   │           └── demo\n│   │   │               ├── CustomConnectionFinderForSpatialSupport.java\n│   │   │               ├── DemoApplication.java\n│   │   │               ├── MyGeo.java\n│   │   │               ├── MyGeoRepository.java\n│   │   │               └── Resource.java\n│   │   └── resources\n│   │       ├── application.properties\n│   │       ├── static\n│   │       └── templates\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>application.properties</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code>spring.datasource.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521/freepdb1\nspring.datasource.username=hr\nspring.datasource.password=oracle\nspring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create\nspring.jpa.properties.hibernate.spatial.dialect=org.hibernate.spatial.dialect.oracle.OracleSpatial10gDialect\nspring.jpa.properties.hibernate.spatial.connection_finder=com.example.demo.CustomConnectionFinderForSpatialSupport\nspring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle12cDialect\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>MyGeo.java:</strong></p>\n<pre><code>package com.example.demo;\n\nimport jakarta.persistence.Column;\nimport jakarta.persistence.Entity;\nimport jakarta.persistence.Id;\nimport lombok.Data;\nimport org.locationtech.jts.geom.Polygon;\n\n@Data\n@Entity\npublic class MyGeo {\n\n    @Id\n    @Column(name = &quot;id&quot;)\n    private String id;\n\n    @Column(name = &quot;shape&quot;,columnDefinition = &quot;MDSYS.SDO_GEOMETRY&quot;)\n    private Polygon shape;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>MyGeoRepository.java</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code>package com.example.demo;\n\nimport org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;\n\npublic interface MyGeoRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;MyGeo, String&gt;

Therefore the issue was also not caused by the Gradle nature of the `server-util` module or Eclipse handling the setup.\r\n\r\nThe final root cause was the `jaxp-api.jar` dependency of the `server` module itself. It was duplicating the `javax.xml` namespace/ package of the JRE, which is against the rules of the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) and therefore leading to the compile errors.\r\n\r\n=&gt; **Contrary to what was assumed at the beginning, it was a typical dependency problem in the end.**\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it was masked by several impressions:\r\n\r\n 1. Eclipse misleading behaviour by opening the wrong library in the &quot;Package-Explorer&quot; view when looking for the sources of the conflicting libraries/ classes.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n 2. The project setup having been successfully imported by colleagues using IntelliJ IDEA\r\n 3. The project being built properly by the build tools and operating fine in production\r\n\r\n---\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; This you can do via `&quot;Ctrl + Click&quot; -&gt; Open Implementation`. But this time Eclipse opened 2x the JRE System Library (1x from `server` module, 1x from `server-util` module) instead of 1x the JRE System Library and 1x the conflicting `jaxp-api.jar` as it used to do. Usually this always was a good and reliable way to identify duplicate/ conflicting libraries in the past.\r\n\r\n## How did I find out?\r\n\r\nIn order to help others facing this or similar issues, let me explain which steps I performed to identify the root cause.\r\n\r\nThe crucial step is to prepare a [minimal reproducible example (MRE)][1] in order to view the individual components in isolation and narrow down the problem:\r\n\r\n 1. Create a small representative project `server-reproduce` with just one (simple) class `XMLUtils`, to reproduce the problem in the simplest form (-&gt; check the bottom for the example code)\r\n 2. Create a small representative project `server-util-java` as a simple Java project (-&gt; not managed by Gradle) - containing no further dependencies than the workspace default JRE 17 System Library (-&gt; same one as used by the `server-reproduce` module)\r\n 3. Create a small representative project `server-util-gradle` as a Gradle project (-&gt; managed by Gradle) - containing no further dependencies than the workspace default JRE 17 System Library (-&gt; same one as used by the `server-reproduce` module)\r\n 4. Add the `server-util-java` module as a project dependency to the `server-reproduce` module\r\n\r\n        =&gt; Expectation: No issues; Observation: No issues\r\n\r\n 5. Remove the `server-util-java` module and add the `server-util-gradle` module as a project dependency to the `server-reproduce` module\r\n\r\n        =&gt; Expectation: Issues will start to occur; Observation: No issues\r\n\r\nThis shows that the assumption that the problems were caused by Eclipse not being able to handle the combination of a simple Java project referencing a project managed by Gradle, and therefore not being able to properly resolve the JREs used, was not the root cause.\r\n\r\nFurther steps to locate the problem:\r\n\r\n6. Remove the `server-util-gradle` module as a project dependency from the `server-reproduce` module\r\n7. Add all the dependencies of the original `server` module to the newly created `server-reproduce` module\r\n\r\n        =&gt; Expectation: No issues; Observation: Issues started to occur\r\n\r\nThis shows the issue must be solely within the setup/ dependencies of the `server-reproduce` module and that no other project dependency is involved.\r\n\r\n## Finding the dependency causing the error\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the earlier helpful way via `&quot;Ctrl + Click&quot; -&gt; Open Implementation`, which should show the conflicting library in the &quot;Package-Explorer&quot;, didn&#39;t work here either. Again Eclipse opened 2x the JRE System Library (but this time the identical one) instead of 1x the JRE System Library and 1x the library causing the error.\r\n\r\nInstead use the &quot;Java-Search&quot; from the Search window (-&gt; `Ctrl + H`) as follows:\r\n\r\n[![Eclipse Java Search][2]][2]\r\n\r\nThis search now properly displays all dependencies introducing declarations for the conflicting class:\r\n\r\n[![Java Search showing all conflicting declarations][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd reveals `jaxp-api.jar` is causing the compile issues.\r\n\r\n\\* *Note: According to my expectation there is a minor bug in the &quot;Java Search&quot; if you&#39;re interested about this check out the section &quot;Further reading&quot; below.*\r\n\r\n## Resolution\r\n\r\nTo resolve the compile issues remove the `jaxp-api.jar` and it&#39;s implementation(s) (like `jaxp-ri.jar`) without replacement (`jaxp-ri.jar` was not directly leading to compile issues, but also is obsolete with Java 9 and above). As per my research the former `jaxp-api.jar`, which was distributed in a standalone bundle, has been integrated into the delivery of Java SE and therefore doesn&#39;t need a replacement.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n- [General info JAXP][4]\r\n- [JAXP details for the latest release][5]\r\n- [Changelog of latest release][6] (please especially refer &quot;Announcement&quot; chapter)\r\n\r\n\r\n## `XMLUtils` example code\r\n\r\n``` lang-java\r\nimport org.w3c.dom.Attr;\r\nimport org.w3c.dom.NamedNodeMap;\r\nimport org.w3c.dom.Node;\r\n\r\npublic class XMLUtils {\r\n\r\n\tprivate XMLUtils() {\r\n\t\t// do not instantiate\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t/**\r\n\t * Provides the value of the specified attribute - when present.

The configuration shall be supported from Eclipse 2022-12. Therefore setting it on my original Eclipse 2021-06 had no effect, but was working fine with Eclipse 2023-09.\r\n\r\n=&gt; **It must be highlighted that this is not recommended and rather a workaround! If possible the root cause should properly be fixed by resolving the conflicts in the project setup/ dependencies e.g. as described above.**\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Further reading\r\n\r\nOf course the real project&#39;s setup was not that simple and kept one more difficulty ready.\r\n\r\nThe module `server` is not only dependent on the module `server-util`, but `server-util` also is physically contained in the project folder of the `server` module as a subfolder.\r\n\r\nIt looks like that:\r\n```\r\nrepository-root/\r\n├─ server/\r\n│  ├─ lib/\r\n│  │  ├─ main/\r\n│  │  │  ├─ libraries\r\n│  ├─ server-util/\r\n│  │  ├─ lib/\r\n│  │  │  ├─ main/\r\n│  │  │  │  ├─ libraries e.g. xml-apis-1.0.b2.jar\r\n```\r\n\\* `server-util` being nested inside of `server`\r\n\r\nThis leads to the fact that if one sets up the project (`server`) in a new workspace in Eclipse, it recognizes the libraries from `server-util` and automatically adds them to the `server` module. If you don&#39;t pay attention here it&#39;s very hard to recognize!\r\n\r\nOf course this is Eclipse&#39;s known default behaviour and usually what one needs, but not for this project. Not paying much attention I overlooked it at first of course.\r\n\r\nTherefore the resolution above was not enough and even though having removed `jaxp-api.jar` from the build path the compile issues still occurred.\r\n\r\nLuckily by using the &quot;Java Search&quot; (-&gt; `Ctrl + H`) as explained above I could identify the additional conflicting libraries quickly:\r\n\r\n[![Conflicting dependencies on real project][7]][7]\r\n\r\nAs can be seen above it turned out that also `xml-apis-1.0.b2.jar` was leading to the compile issues. But this jar anyways was not expected to be on the build path from the beginning. Therefore, it was rather a coincidence that this step has become necessary and should actually not have been the case.\r\n\r\nBut this revealed a **possible bug in the Eclipse &quot;Java Search&quot;** (-&gt; `Ctrl + H`). As I reproduced the same scenario in my MRE I noticed the &quot;Java Search&quot; is not displaying all (conflicting) dependencies in my MRE projects even though it should. I suspect it&#39;s because the dependencies in my MRE were structured slightly differently and located outside of the project folder like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\neclipse-workspace/\r\n├─ server-reproduce/\r\n│  ├─ lib/\r\n│  │  ├─ main/\r\n│  │  │  ├─ libraries\r\n├─ server-util-gradle/\r\n│  ├─ lib/\r\n│  │  ├─ main/\r\n│  │  │  ├─ libraries e.g. xml-apis-1.0.b2.jar\r\n```\r\n\\* `server-util-gradle` not being nested inside of `server-reproduce` and residing on the same folder level\r\n\r\n=&gt; In this scenario the compile issues still remained (because the `server-reproduce` referenced the `xml-apis-1.0.b2.jar`), but the &quot;Java Search&quot; was not displaying it as a source of declaration for the conflicting classes, even though the checkbox &quot;Application libraries&quot; was ticked as displayed at the top. **I want to highlight this, in case someone is following the steps described in this answer and may be wondering why not all conflict causing dependencies are displayed within the search.**\r\n\r\n=&gt; To me it seems like a bug in the search in Eclipse, since in this scenario I definitely would consider `xml-apis-1.0.b2.jar` to be an &quot;Application library&quot;.\r\n\r\n## One final question remains though\r\n\r\nWhy is `xml-apis-1.0.b2.jar` leading to the compile issues when being referenced as a direct dependency in `server` or `server-reproduce` respectively, but when being pulled as a transitive dependency through `server-util` (as a Gradle project) it&#39;s not?\r\n\r\n=&gt; This I still didn&#39;t figure out and it surprises me. Anyways it&#39;ll be not relevant for the project anymore since I&#39;m planning to also remove `xml-apis-1.0.b2.jar` entirely. But I&#39;m still curious and would like to know.

But one after the other:\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\nIn the end it&#39;s a &quot;typical&quot; &quot;The package org.w3c.dom is accessible from more than one module: \\&lt;unnamed\\&gt;, java.xml&quot; issue. But unlike having defined redundant, conflicting dependencies, it&#39;s more due to the special project setup and Eclipse not properly handling the project setup, since the conflicting dependencies both come from the same system library JRE.\r\n\r\nFrom the server module:\r\n\r\n[![Compile errors][1]][1]\r\n\r\n## Project Background\r\nWe are working on the project for a long time now (big legacy project). During the work we&#39;ve already upgraded from Java 1.6 over Java 1.8 to now Java 17. All the upgrades were fine so far except the last one. But only with the introduction of Java 17 also the new module `server-util` was introduced, which seems to cause the issues (see below).\r\n\r\nWhen using Java 1.8 in the Compiler-Options the project also is compiling fine, but as soon the Compiler-Options are increased to &gt;Java 9 (e.g. 17) the compile issues occur.\r\n\r\n## Tools\r\n\r\n - Eclipse 2021_06 (but the issues also occur with latest Eclipse 2023_09)\r\n - Java 17 (jdk-17.0.5+8)\r\n - Gradle (Wrapper) 7.4.2\r\n - Our project doesn&#39;t use *module-info.java* thus should reside in the default *unnamed* module\r\n\r\n\r\n## Project Setup\r\nThe project is structured into 4 modules: `client`, `server`, `share` and `server-util`. Whereby `client` and `server` usually are independend modules and the `share` is shared between the two. `server-util` is a small utility module which provides additional utilities/ services for the `server` module.\r\nA graphical representation would look like this:\r\n\r\n    client    server - server-util\r\n        \\     /\r\n         share\r\n\r\nAll of the modules except the `server-util` module are &quot;simple&quot; Java-Projects (so no Maven or Gradle is in place here (yet)). The build tool used for this modules is Ant. Only the `server-util` module makes use of **Gradle**.\r\n\r\n## Observations/ Issue\r\n\r\n 1. When switching the Compiler-Options from 1.8 to 17 as explained above the issues start to occur. Interestingly the issues only arise between the `server` and `server-util` modules. `client - share` and `server - share` don&#39;t show this kind of issues.\r\n 2. When tracing down the conflicting dependencies they both originate from the configured default JRE for the workspace which is a JDK 17 (both `server` module and `server-util` use the same). But during the trace once it&#39;s opened from `server` module and once from `server-util` module (-&gt; in the Package Explorer view). Therefore it seems Eclipse doesn&#39;t recognize it&#39;s the same JRE/ JDK being used within the projects (whereby it does recognize it between the `client - share` and `server - share` modules and therfore doesn&#39;t bring up the issues).\r\n 3. Since `server-util` project is a Gradle project Eclipse offers the `Gradle -&gt; Refresh Gradle Project` option in the context menu. Usually when I perform this operation this also leads to compile issues, since the usually configured JRE isn&#39;t recognized anymore or even actively reset. =&gt; When opening the Build Path of the module none of the available JREs is selected/ configured anymore. I always need to manually select &quot;Workspace default JRE&quot; (-&gt; JDK 17) again.\r\n\r\n## Assumption\r\nSince the setup is working for the colleagues using IntelliJ IDE and also at Build Time (-&gt; Ant) and runtime everything is working fine I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a general or plain dependency issue.\r\n\r\nMy assumption is that Eclipse cannot handle the relationship between the `server` and `server-util` projects well. And the most obvious reason is that one is a plain, &quot;simple&quot; Java Project, whereby the other is a Gradle project. Therefore Eclipse doesn&#39;t seem to properly detect the usage of the same &quot;system library -&gt; JRE&quot; and therefore falsely is claiming the error &quot;The package org.w3c.dom is accessible from more than one module: \\&lt;unnamed\\&gt;, java.xml&quot;.\r\n\r\nBut it&#39;s not exactly clear if it&#39;s the combination of both or maybe even solely related to the Gradle project itself (whether it&#39;s our project&#39;s setup or some kind of issue with the Eclipse Gradle plugin or so).\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried different things like\r\n - Using different Eclipse versions (from 2021_06 till finally latest 2023_09)\r\n - Changing Module Dependencies from Build Path settings\r\n - Using different Build Path settings like configuring the JRE in different ways\r\n - Moving the JRE from the &quot;Modulepath&quot; section to the &quot;Classpath&quot; section according to this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50321602/in-eclipse-what-is-the-difference-between-modulepath-and-classpath.

But one after the other:</p>\n<h2>Issue</h2>\n<p>In the end it's a &quot;typical&quot; &quot;The package org.w3c.dom is accessible from more than one module: &lt;unnamed&gt;, java.xml&quot; issue. But unlike having defined redundant, conflicting dependencies, it's more due to the special project setup and Eclipse not properly handling the project setup, since the conflicting dependencies both come from the same system library JRE.</p>\n<p>From the server module:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FnBoT.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FnBoT.png\" alt=\"Compile errors\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Project Background</h2>\n<p>We are working on the project for a long time now (big legacy project). During the work we've already upgraded from Java 1.6 over Java 1.8 to now Java 17. All the upgrades were fine so far except the last one. But only with the introduction of Java 17 also the new module <code>server-util</code> was introduced, which seems to cause the issues (see below).</p>\n<p>When using Java 1.8 in the Compiler-Options the project also is compiling fine, but as soon the Compiler-Options are increased to &gt;Java 9 (e.g. 17) the compile issues occur.</p>\n<h2>Tools</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Eclipse 2021_06 (but the issues also occur with latest Eclipse 2023_09)</li>\n<li>Java 17 (jdk-17.0.5+8)</li>\n<li>Gradle (Wrapper) 7.4.2</li>\n<li>Our project doesn't use <em>module-info.java</em> thus should reside in the default <em>unnamed</em> module</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Project Setup</h2>\n<p>The project is structured into 4 modules: <code>client</code>, <code>server</code>, <code>share</code> and <code>server-util</code>. Whereby <code>client</code> and <code>server</code> usually are independend modules and the <code>share</code> is shared between the two. <code>server-util</code> is a small utility module which provides additional utilities/ services for the <code>server</code> module.\nA graphical representation would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>client    server - server-util\n    \\     /\n     share\n</code></pre>\n<p>All of the modules except the <code>server-util</code> module are &quot;simple&quot; Java-Projects (so no Maven or Gradle is in place here (yet)). The build tool used for this modules is Ant. Only the <code>server-util</code> module makes use of <strong>Gradle</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Observations/ Issue</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>When switching the Compiler-Options from 1.8 to 17 as explained above the issues start to occur. Interestingly the issues only arise between the <code>server</code> and <code>server-util</code> modules. <code>client - share</code> and <code>server - share</code> don't show this kind of issues.</li>\n<li>When tracing down the conflicting dependencies they both originate from the configured default JRE for the workspace which is a JDK 17 (both <code>server</code> module and <code>server-util</code> use the same). But during the trace once it's opened from <code>server</code> module and once from <code>server-util</code> module (-&gt; in the Package Explorer view). Therefore it seems Eclipse doesn't recognize it's the same JRE/ JDK being used within the projects (whereby it does recognize it between the <code>client - share</code> and <code>server - share</code> modules and therfore doesn't bring up the issues).</li>\n<li>Since <code>server-util</code> project is a Gradle project Eclipse offers the <code>Gradle -&gt; Refresh Gradle Project</code> option in the context menu. Usually when I perform this operation this also leads to compile issues, since the usually configured JRE isn't recognized anymore or even actively reset. =&gt; When opening the Build Path of the module none of the available JREs is selected/ configured anymore.

It will only find properties supported in the Unicode Character Database for whichever UCD version that the version of Perl you’re running supports. \r\n\r\nI also like my output sorted, so I tend to run\r\n\r\n     % unichars -gs &#39;\\p{Alphabetic}&#39; &#39;\\p{Age=6.0}&#39; | ucsort | less -r\r\n\r\nwhere that’s the  [ucsort](http://training.perl.com/scripts/ucsort) program, which sorts text according to the Unicode Collation Algorithm.\r\n\r\nHowever, in Perl unlike in Java this is easy to find out.

I talk about that a bit at the end of my [OSCON Unicode Support Shootout](http:://training.perl.com/OSCON2011/index.html) talk.  I had thought of putting together a table of which languages supports which versions of Unicode in which versions of those languages, but ended up scrapping that to tell people to just get the latest version of each language.  For example, I know that Unicode 6.0.0 is supported by Java 1.7, Perl 5.14, and Python 2.7 or 3.2.\r\n\r\nJDK7 contains updates for classes `Character`, `String`, and `Pattern` in support of Unicode 6.0.0.  This includes support for Unicode script properties, and several enhancements to `Pattern` to allow it to meet Level 1 support requirements for [Unicode UTS#18 Regular Expressions](http://unicode.org/reports/tr18/).  These include \r\n\r\n* The `isupper` and `islower` methods now correctly correspond to the Unicode uppercase and lowercase properties; previously they misapplied only to letters, which isn’t right, because it misses `Other_Uppercase` and `Other_Lowercase` code points, respectively.  For example, these are some lowercase codepoints **which are not** `GC=Ll` (lowercase letters), selected samples only: \r\n\r\n        % unichars -gs &#39;\\p{lowercase}&#39; &#39;\\P{LL}&#39;\r\n        ◌ͅ  U+0345 GC=Mn SC=Inherited    COMBINING GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI\r\n        ͺ  U+037A GC=Lm SC=Greek        GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI\r\n        ˢ  U+02E2 GC=Lm SC=Latin        MODIFIER LETTER SMALL S\r\n        ˣ  U+02E3 GC=Lm SC=Latin        MODIFIER LETTER SMALL X\r\n        ᴬ  U+1D2C GC=Lm SC=Latin        MODIFIER LETTER CAPITAL A\r\n        ᴮ  U+1D2E GC=Lm SC=Latin        MODIFIER LETTER CAPITAL B\r\n        ᵂ  U+1D42 GC=Lm SC=Latin        MODIFIER LETTER CAPITAL W\r\n        ᵃ  U+1D43 GC=Lm SC=Latin        MODIFIER LETTER SMALL A\r\n        ᵇ  U+1D47 GC=Lm SC=Latin        MODIFIER LETTER SMALL B\r\n        ₐ  U+2090 GC=Lm SC=Latin        LATIN SUBSCRIPT SMALL LETTER A\r\n        ₑ  U+2091 GC=Lm SC=Latin        LATIN SUBSCRIPT SMALL LETTER E\r\n        ⅰ  U+2170 GC=Nl SC=Latin        SMALL ROMAN NUMERAL ONE\r\n        ⅱ  U+2171 GC=Nl SC=Latin        SMALL ROMAN NUMERAL TWO\r\n        ⅲ  U+2172 GC=Nl SC=Latin        SMALL ROMAN NUMERAL THREE\r\n        ⓐ  U+24D0 GC=So SC=Common       CIRCLED LATIN SMALL LETTER A\r\n        ⓑ  U+24D1 GC=So SC=Common       CIRCLED LATIN SMALL LETTER B\r\n        ⓒ  U+24D2 GC=So SC=Common       CIRCLED LATIN SMALL LETTER C\r\n\r\n \r\n* The alphabetic tests are now correct in that they use `Other_Alphabetic`. They did this wrong prior to 1.7, which is a problem.\r\n\r\n* The `\\x{HHHHH}` pattern escape so you can meet RL1.1; this lets you rewrite `[&#119964;-&#119989;]` (which fails due to The UTF‐16 Curse) as `[\\x{1D49C}-\\x{1D4B5}]`. **JDK7 is the first Java release that fully/correctly supports non-BMP characters** in this regard.  Amazing but true.\r\n\r\n* More properties for RL1.2, of which the script property is by far the most important.  This lets you write `\\p{script=Greek}` for example, abbreviated as `\\p{Greek}`.\r\n\r\n* The new `UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASSES` pattern compilation flag and corresponding pattern‐embeddable flag `&quot;(?U)&quot;` to meet RL1.2a on compatibility properties.\r\n\r\nI can certainly see why you want to make sure you’re running a Java with Unicode 6.0.0 support, since that comes with all those other benefits, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"How to identify programmatically in Java which Unicode version supported?","body":"<p>The easiest way but worst way I can think of to do that would be to pick a code point that’d new to each Unicode release, and check its Character properties.

Also, I tried to use a <code>Map</code> instead using the object <code>TimePlayed</code> but it did not work as well.<br />\nAs you can see, inside the <code>timePlayed</code> is a date and an integer.<br />\nThis is the code that I have while writing this question:</p>\n<p>Class <code>GameData</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>@Table(name = &quot;GAME_DATA&quot;)\n@Entity\n@Data\npublic class GameData {\n\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.UUID)\n    private String gameDataId;\n\n    private String publisherId;\n    private String name;\n\n    private Map&lt;Date, String&gt; timePlayed;\n\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Class <code>TimePlayed</code></p>\n<pre><code>@Table(name = &quot;TIME_PLAYED&quot;)\n@Data\n@Entity\npublic class TimePlayed {\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)\n    @Column(name = &quot;id&quot;, nullable = false)\n    private Long id;\n\n    private Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; playedDateAndTime;\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>My guess that using a second class is not the best approach but this what I was capable to do so far and, of course, is not working at all.<br />\nI got a some errors like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Object references an unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing hibernate JPA</li>\n<li>'Basic' attribute type should not be a map</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":["java","soap","xsd","wsdl","dom4j"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":116746,"reputation":12477,"user_id":306030,"accept_rate":70,"display_name":"forty-two"},"score":0,"creation_date":1696459734,"post_id":77219025,"comment_id":136157477,"body_markdown":"You need to elaborate on your problem, since it is unclear what you mean with &quot;include&quot;.

The JSON value as a whole (including embedded literals), however, <i>might</i>, if it needs to be stored as bytes; the standard mandates one of the UTF- encodings shall be used."},{"owner":{"account_id":5241080,"reputation":913,"user_id":4188092,"display_name":"Patanjali"},"score":0,"creation_date":1465802851,"post_id":3020108,"comment_id":63034756,"body_markdown":"@LS. stringify() can change the order of non-array object properties, as cited at https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify","body":"@LS. stringify() can change the order of non-array object properties, as cited at <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/&hellip;</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":260282,"reputation":3302,"user_id":543738,"accept_rate":39,"display_name":"Mr. Lance E Sloan"},"score":0,"creation_date":1465824527,"post_id":3020108,"comment_id":63048203,"body_markdown":"@Patanjali: The question and comments didn&#39;t specify order is important.

Maven dependencies required for my setup are as below:\r\n\r\n\t&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;org.bgee.log4jdbc-log4j2&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;log4jdbc-log4j2-jdbc4.1&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;version&gt;1.16&lt;/version&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\t&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;org.slf4j&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;slf4j-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;version&gt;${slf4j.version}&lt;/version&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\t&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;ch.qos.logback&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;logback-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;version&gt;${logback.version}&lt;/version&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\t&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;ch.qos.logback&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;logback-classic&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;version&gt;$logback.version}&lt;/version&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\nThe driver and DB URLs then look like:\r\n\r\n    database.driver.class=net.sf.log4jdbc.sql.jdbcapi.DriverSpy\r\n    database.url=jdbc:log4jdbc:hsqldb:mem:db_name #Hsql\r\n    #database.url=jdbc:log4jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db_name \r\n\r\n\r\nMy `logback.xml` configuration file looks like the below: this outputs all SQL statements with parameters plus the resultset tables for all queries.\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n    &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n    \r\n    \t&lt;appender name=&quot;STDOUT&quot; class=&quot;ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender&quot;&gt;\r\n    \t\t&lt;encoder&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t&lt;pattern&gt;%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n\r\n    \t\t\t&lt;/pattern&gt;\r\n    \t\t&lt;/encoder&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;/appender&gt;\r\n    \r\n    \t&lt;logger name=&quot;jdbc.audit&quot; level=&quot;ERROR&quot; /&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;logger name=&quot;jdbc.connection&quot; level=&quot;ERROR&quot; /&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;logger name=&quot;jdbc.sqltiming&quot; level=&quot;ERROR&quot; /&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;logger name=&quot;jdbc.resultset&quot; level=&quot;ERROR&quot; /&gt;\r\n    \t\r\n\t    &lt;!-- UNCOMMENT THE BELOW TO HIDE THE RESULT SET TABLE OUTPUT --&gt;\r\n\t    &lt;!--&lt;logger name=&quot;jdbc.resultsettable&quot; level=&quot;ERROR&quot; /&gt; --&gt;\r\n\r\n    \t&lt;root level=&quot;debug&quot;&gt;\r\n    \t\t&lt;appender-ref ref=&quot;STDOUT&quot; /&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;/root&gt;\r\n    &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n\r\nFinally, I had to create a file named `log4jdbc.log4j2.properties` at the root of the classpath e.g. `src/test/resources` or src/main/resources in a Maven project.
