gets bigger and bigger in every \r\n\r\nsingle bucket.\r\n\r\nHow do we stop our buckets from getting too full?\r\n\r\nThe solution here is that \r\n\r\n              &quot;the HashSet can automatically\r\n\r\n            resize the number of buckets.&quot;\r\n\r\n \r\nThere&#39;s the HashSet realizes that the buckets are getting \r\n\r\ntoo full.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s losing this advantage of this all of one lookup for \r\n\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nAnd it&#39;ll just create more buckets(generally twice as before) and\r\n\r\nthen place the elements into the correct bucket.\r\n\r\nSo here&#39;s our basic HashSet implementation with separate \r\n\r\nchaining.\r\nNow I&#39;m going to create a &quot;self-resizing HashSet&quot;.\r\n\r\nThis HashSet is going to realize that the buckets are \r\n\r\ngetting too full and\r\n\r\nit needs more buckets.\r\n\r\nloadFactor is another field in our HashSet class.\r\n\r\nloadFactor represents the average number of elements per \r\n\r\nbucket,\r\n\r\nabove which we want to resize.\r\n\r\nloadFactor is a balance between space and time.\r\n\r\nIf the buckets get too full then we&#39;ll resize.\r\n\r\nThat takes time, of course, but\r\n\r\nit may save us time down the road if the buckets are a \r\n\r\nlittle more empty.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s see an example.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a HashSet, we&#39;ve added four elements so far.\r\n\r\nElephant, dog, cat and fish.\r\n\r\n              buckets      elements\r\n          -------      -------\r\n            0          \r\n            1          elephant\r\n             2          cat -&gt;dog\r\n             3           fish\r\n              4         \r\n               5\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point, I&#39;ve decided that the loadFactor, the \r\n\r\nthreshold,\r\n\r\nthe average number of elements per bucket that I&#39;m okay \r\n\r\nwith, is 0.75.\r\n\r\nThe number of buckets is buckets.length, which is 6, and\r\n\r\nat this point our HashSet has four elements, so the \r\n\r\ncurrent size is 4.\r\n\r\nWe&#39;ll resize our HashSet, that is we&#39;ll add more buckets,\r\n\r\nwhen the average number of elements per bucket exceeds \r\n\r\nthe loadFactor.\r\n\r\nThat is when current size divided by buckets.length is \r\n\r\ngreater than loadFactor.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the average number of elements per bucket \r\n\r\nis 4 divided by 6.\r\n\r\n4 elements, 6 buckets, that&#39;s 0.67.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s less than the threshold I set of 0.75 so we&#39;re \r\n\r\nokay.\r\n\r\nWe don&#39;t need to resize.\r\n\r\nBut now let&#39;s say we add woodchuck.\r\n\r\n                      buckets      elements\r\n          -------      -------\r\n            0          \r\n            1          elephant\r\n             2        woodchuck-&gt; cat -&gt;dog\r\n             3           fish\r\n              4         \r\n               5\r\n\r\n\r\nWoodchuck would end up in bucket number 3.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the currentSize is 5.\r\n\r\nAnd now the average number of elements per bucket\r\n\r\nis the currentSize divided by buckets.length.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s 5 elements divided by 6 buckets is 0.83.\r\n\r\nAnd this exceeds the loadFactor which was 0.75.\r\n\r\nIn order to address this problem, in order to make the \r\n\r\nbuckets perhaps a little\r\n\r\nmore empty so that operations like determining whether a \r\n\r\nbucket contains\r\n\r\nan element will be a little less complex, I wanna resize \r\n\r\nmy HashSet.\r\n\r\nResizing the HashSet takes two steps.\r\n\r\nFirst I&#39;ll double the number of buckets, I had 6 buckets,\r\n\r\nnow I&#39;m going to have 12 buckets.\r\n\r\nNote here that the loadFactor which I set to 0.75 stays the same.\r\n\r\nBut the number of buckets changed is 12,\r\n\r\nthe number of elements stayed the same, is 5.\r\n\r\n5 divided by 12 is around 0.42, that&#39;s well under our \r\n\r\nloadFactor,\r\n\r\nso we&#39;re okay now.\r\n\r\nBut we&#39;re not done because some of these elements are in \r\n\r\nthe wrong bucket now.\r\n\r\nFor instance, elephant.\r\n\r\n\r\nElephant was in bucket number 2 because the number of \r\n\r\ncharacters in elephant\r\n\r\nwas 8.\r\n\r\nWe have 6 buckets, 8 minus 6 is 2.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why it ended up in number 2.\r\n\r\nBut now that we have 12 buckets, 8 mod 12 is 8, so\r\n\r\nelephant does not belong in bucket number 2 anymore.\r\n\r\nElephant belongs in bucket number 8.\r\n\r\nWhat about woodchuck?\r\n\r\n\r\nWoodchuck was the one that started this whole problem.\r\n\r\nWoodchuck ended up in bucket number 3.\r\n\r\nBecause 9 mod 6 is 3.\r\n\r\nBut now we do 9 mod 12.\r\n\r\n9 mod 12 is 9, woodchuck goes to bucket number 9.\r\n\r\nAnd you see the advantage of all this.\r\n\r\nNow bucket number 3 only has two elements whereas before \r\nit had 3.\r\n\r\nSo here&#39;s our code,\r\n\r\nwhere we had our HashSet with separate chaining that \r\n\r\ndidn&#39;t do any resizing.\r\n\r\nNow, here&#39;s a new implementation where we use resizing.\r\n\r\nMost of this code is the same,\r\n\r\nwe&#39;re still going to determine whether it contains the \r\n\r\nvalue already.\r\n\r\nIf it doesn&#39;t, then we&#39;ll figure it out which bucket it \r\n\r\nshould go into and\r\n\r\nthen add it to that bucket, add it to that LinkedList.\r\n\r\nBut now we increment the currentSize field.\r\n\r\ncurrentSize was the field that kept track of the number \r\n\r\nof elements in our HashSet.\r\n\r\nWe&#39;re going to increment it and then we&#39;re going to look \r\n\r\nat the average load,\r\n\r\nthe average number of elements per bucket.\r\n\r\nWe&#39;ll do that division down here.\r\n\r\nWe have to do a little bit of casting here to make sure \r\n\r\nthat we get a double.\r\n\r\nAnd then, we&#39;ll compare that average load to the field \r\n\r\nthat I&#39;ve set as\r\n\r\n0.75 when I created this HashSet, for instance, which was \r\n\r\nthe loadFactor.\r\n\r\nIf the average load is greater than the loadFactor,\r\n\r\nthat means there&#39;s too many elements per bucket on \r\n\r\naverage, and I need to reinsert.\r\n\r\nSo here&#39;s our implementation of the method to reinsert \r\n\r\nall the elements.\r\n\r\nFirst, I&#39;ll create a local variable called oldBuckets.\r\n\r\nWhich is referring to the buckets as they currently stand\r\n\r\nbefore I start resizing everything.\r\n\r\nNote I&#39;m not creating a new array of linked lists just yet.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m just renaming buckets as oldBuckets.\r\n\r\nNow remember buckets was a field in our class, I&#39;m going \r\n\r\nto now create a new array\r\n\r\nof linked lists but this will have twice as many elements \r\n\r\nas it did the first time.\r\n\r\nNow I need to actually do the reinserting,\r\n\r\nI&#39;m going to iterate through all of the old buckets.\r\n\r\nEach element in oldBuckets is a LinkedList of strings \r\n\r\nthat is a bucket.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll go through that bucket and get each element in that \r\n\r\nbucket.\r\n\r\nAnd now I&#39;m gonna reinsert it into the newBuckets.\r\n\r\nI will get its hashCode.\r\n\r\nI will figure out which index it is.\r\n\r\nAnd now I get the new bucket, the new LinkedList of \r\n\r\nstrings and\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll add it to that new bucket.\r\n\r\nSo to recap, HashSets as we&#39;ve seen are arrays of Linked \r\n\r\nLists, or buckets.\r\n\r\nA self resizing HashSet can realize using some ratio or","title":"What is the significance of load factor in HashMap?","body":"<p>If the buckets get too full, then we

and fish.</p>\n\n<pre><code>          buckets      elements\n      -------      -------\n        0          \n        1          elephant\n         2          cat -&gt;dog\n         3           fish\n          4         \n           5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At this point, I've decided that the loadFactor, the </p>\n\n<p>threshold,</p>\n\n<p>the average number of elements per bucket that I'm okay </p>\n\n<p>with, is 0.75.</p>\n\n<p>The number of buckets is buckets.length, which is 6, and</p>\n\n<p>at this point our HashSet has four elements, so the </p>\n\n<p>current size is 4.</p>\n\n<p>We'll resize our HashSet, that is we'll add more buckets,</p>\n\n<p>when the average number of elements per bucket exceeds </p>\n\n<p>the loadFactor.</p>\n\n<p>That is when current size divided by buckets.length is </p>\n\n<p>greater than loadFactor.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, the average number of elements per bucket </p>\n\n<p>is 4 divided by 6.</p>\n\n<p>4 elements, 6 buckets, that's 0.67.</p>\n\n<p>That's less than the threshold I set of 0.75 so we're </p>\n\n<p>okay.</p>\n\n<p>We don't need to resize.</p>\n\n<p>But now let's say we add woodchuck.</p>\n\n<pre><code>                  buckets      elements\n      -------      -------\n        0          \n        1          elephant\n         2        woodchuck-&gt; cat -&gt;dog\n         3           fish\n          4         \n           5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Woodchuck would end up in bucket number 3.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, the currentSize is 5.</p>\n\n<p>And now the average number of elements per bucket</p>\n\n<p>is the currentSize divided by buckets.length.</p>\n\n<p>That's 5 elements divided by 6 buckets is 0.83.</p>\n\n<p>And this exceeds the loadFactor which was 0.75.</p>\n\n<p>In order to address this problem, in order to make the </p>\n\n<p>buckets perhaps a little</p>\n\n<p>more empty so that operations like determining whether a </p>\n\n<p>bucket contains</p>\n\n<p>an element will be a little less complex, I wanna resize </p>\n\n<p>my HashSet.</p>\n\n<p>Resizing the HashSet takes two steps.</p>\n\n<p>First I'll double the number of buckets, I had 6 buckets,</p>\n\n<p>now I'm going to have 12 buckets.</p>\n\n<p>Note here that the loadFactor which I set to 0.75 stays the same.</p>\n\n<p>But the number of buckets changed is 12,</p>\n\n<p>the number of elements stayed the same, is 5.</p>\n\n<p>5 divided by 12 is around 0.42, that's well under our </p>\n\n<p>loadFactor,</p>\n\n<p>so we're okay now.</p>\n\n<p>But we're not done because some of these elements are in </p>\n\n<p>the wrong bucket now.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, elephant.</p>\n\n<p>Elephant was in bucket number 2 because the number of </p>\n\n<p>characters in elephant</p>\n\n<p>was 8.</p>\n\n<p>We have 6 buckets, 8 minus 6 is 2.</p>\n\n<p>That's why it ended up in number 2.</p>\n\n<p>But now that we have 12 buckets, 8 mod 12 is 8, so</p>\n\n<p>elephant does not belong in bucket number 2 anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Elephant belongs in bucket number 8.</p>\n\n<p>What about woodchuck?</p>\n\n<p>Woodchuck was the one that started this whole problem.</p>\n\n<p>Woodchuck ended up in bucket number 3.</p>\n\n<p>Because 9 mod 6 is 3.</p>\n\n<p>But now we do 9 mod 12.</p>\n\n<p>9 mod 12 is 9, woodchuck goes to bucket number 9.</p>\n\n<p>And you see the advantage of all this.</p>\n\n<p>Now bucket number 3 only has two elements whereas before \nit had 3.</p>\n\n<p>So here's our code,</p>\n\n<p>where we had our HashSet with separate chaining that </p>\n\n<p>didn't do any resizing.</p>\n\n<p>Now, here's a new implementation where we use resizing.</p>\n\n<p>Most of this code is the same,</p>\n\n<p>we're still going to determine whether it contains the </p>\n\n<p>value already.</p>\n\n<p>If it doesn't, then we'll figure it out which bucket it </p>\n\n<p>should go into and</p>\n\n<p>then add it to that bucket, add it to that LinkedList.</p>\n\n<p>But now we increment the currentSize field.</p>\n\n<p>currentSize was the field that kept track of the number </p>\n\n<p>of elements in our HashSet.</p>\n\n<p>We're going to increment it and then we're going to look </p>\n\n<p>at the average load,</p>\n\n<p>the average number of elements per bucket.</p>\n\n<p>We'll do that division down here.</p>\n\n<p>We have to do a little bit of casting here to make sure </p>\n\n<p>that we get a double.</p>\n\n<p>And then, we'll compare that average load to the field </p>\n\n<p>that I've set as</p>\n\n<p>0.75 when I created this HashSet, for instance, which was </p>\n\n<p>the loadFactor.</p>\n\n<p>If the average load is greater than the loadFactor,</p>\n\n<p>that means there's too many elements per bucket on </p>\n\n<p>average, and I need to reinsert.</p>\n\n<p>So here's our implementation of the method to reinsert </p>\n\n<p>all the elements.</p>\n\n<p>First, I'll create a local variable called oldBuckets.</p>\n\n<p>Which is referring to the buckets as they currently stand</p>\n\n<p>before I start resizing everything.</p>\n\n<p>Note I'm not creating a new array of linked lists just yet.</p>\n\n<p>I'm just renaming buckets as oldBuckets.</p>\n\n<p>Now remember buckets was a field in our class, I'm going </p>\n\n<p>to now create a new array</p>\n\n<p>of linked lists but this will have twice as many elements </p>\n\n<p>as it did the first time.</p>\n\n<p>Now I need to actually do the reinserting,</p>\n\n<p>I'm going to iterate through all of the old buckets.</p>\n\n<p>Each element in oldBuckets is a LinkedList of strings </p>\n\n<p>that is a bucket.</p>\n\n<p>I'll go through that bucket and get each element in that </p>\n\n<p>bucket.</p>\n\n<p>And now I'm gonna reinsert it into the newBuckets.</p>\n\n<p>I will get its hashCode.</p>\n\n<p>I will figure out which index it is.</p>\n\n<p>And now I get the new bucket, the new LinkedList of </p>\n\n<p>strings and</p>\n\n<p>I'll add it to that new bucket.</p>\n\n<p>So to recap, HashSets as we've seen are arrays of Linked </p>\n\n<p>Lists, or buckets.</p>\n\n<p>A self resizing HashSet can realize using some ratio or</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4103600,"reputation":1450,"user_id":3368395,"display_name":"provisota"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":13,"is_accepted":false,"score":13,"last_activity_date":1555766540,"creation_date":1555766540,"answer_id":55773938,"question_id":10901752,"body_markdown":"For

Creating Android Projects ###\r\n\r\nFirstly, one has to note, that the&#160;exact structure of an Android project mostly depends on the used IDE, e.g. Android Studio,&#160;Eclipse,&#160;IntelliJ, and the build systems it supports, e.g. Gradle,&#160;Maven,&#160;Ant. However nobody is forced to use any of these. In contrary, one doesn&#39;t need to use any of them, as I explained and applied in my article [&quot;Mobile Development: APK Building on Mobile&quot;][1].\r\n\r\nSo there is actually no &quot;correct&quot; physical structure for an Android project, only a logical one like depicted in Fig.1.\r\n\r\n[![Logical structure of an Android application project][2]][2]\r\n**Fig.1.** Logical structure of an Android application project\r\n\r\nNevertheless one can assume, that one would want to create an [Android Studio alike project structure][3]. Alas, as pointed out in the Android Development Documentation for the [`android`][4] tool, and discussed in the Stackoverflow thread [&quot;How to create an Android project from the command line&quot;][5], the once for this purpose provided `android` tool has become deprecated and isn&#39;t part of the official command-line tools anymore. All its functionality has been delegated to other tools. The automatic creation of Android projects is now done using Android Studio itself, as the official [documentation][4] says.\r\n\r\nSo for that there&#39;s no replacement on the CLI for now. One would have to create such kind of a project structure manually, or copy an existing Android Studio project as a basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2. Establishing a CLI based Development Environment ###\r\n\r\n#### 2.1. On Linux, Windows and MacOS ####\r\n\r\nThe Android Developer Documentations on the [Android SDK Command-line Tools][6] and the corresponding [Release Notes][7] are the first addresses for the documentation of the tools, considering setup, usage options and further notes.\r\n\r\nThe basic steps to setup a CLI based APK development environment are as follows.\r\n\r\n 1. Set the environment variables as described in the [documentation][8].\r\n 2. Download the [`cmdline-tools`][9], which include core tools as [`sdkmanager`][10] to manage the SDK components, [`avdmanager`][11] for emulators, as well as debugging and tuning tools like [`r8`][12] and [`lint`][13]. \r\n 3. Use `sdkmanager` to install the following packages:\r\n    - [`build-tools`][14] -- Contains basic toolchain programs like [`aapt`][15], [`apksigner`][16], and [`d8`][17].\r\n    - `platforms` -- Contains the Android platform, i.e. API level, you want to develop for. Note, that you can use several platforms in parallel at need.\r\n    - [`platform-tools`][18] -- Contains instruments, e.g. the important [`adb`][19], that interface with the corresponding Android platform. Choose the `platform-tools` according to the before selected `platforms` packages.\r\n    - [`ndk`][20] -- Needed for performant [native programming][21].\r\n 5. Use [`avdmanager`][11] to manage the Android device emulators of the Android SDK.\r\n 6. If required, also install [`gradle`][22] according to the [Installation][23] guide. Gradle can then be used from CLI, as described in its [Command-Line Interface][24] user guide.\r\n\r\n#### 2.2. On Android ####\r\n\r\nOne can actually develop mobile applications right on a mobile device. Therefore one has to install the terminal emulator [Termux][25] on it. Installation and usage don&#39;t need rooting of the device. Its repositories provide packages for many purposes, inter alia all necessary tools for APK building.\r\n\r\nThen there are two approaches to achieve a CLI based development within Termux.\r\n\r\nOne is to achieve essentially the same setup as on a desktop, like described above, by following meticulously [this guide][26]. Note, that this will need at least 6GB free storage, easily up to 10GB and more, on your mobile device.\r\n\r\nAnother is to use the free APK building tool [`apkbuilder`][27]. It is my slim solution which requires all in all, so with all necessary components, less than 800MB, and no further configuration. Works without restrictions considering the project&#39;s structure and complexity. Supports also projects using native C/C++ code besides Java. Kotlin support is envisaged for the next version. The complete guide for installation and usage is located [here][29].\r\n\r\n### Epilogue ###\r\n\r\nSeveral roads lead to Rome. Free available tools allow a purely CLI based development of Android applications both in desktop environments, and even on mobile devices themselves.

However, this is not the case, as I only see the path to CustomConfigSource.java included.</p>\n<p>I tried fixing this issue by adding the following maven-shade-plugin:</p>\n<pre><code>             &lt;plugin&gt;\n                &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\n                &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-shade-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n                &lt;version&gt;3.2.2&lt;/version&gt;\n                &lt;executions&gt;\n                    &lt;execution&gt;\n                        &lt;phase&gt;package&lt;/phase&gt;\n                        &lt;goals&gt;\n                            &lt;goal&gt;shade&lt;/goal&gt;\n                        &lt;/goals&gt;\n                        &lt;configuration&gt;\n                            &lt;transformers&gt;\n                                &lt;transformer implementation=&quot;org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.AppendingTransformer&quot;&gt;\n                                    &lt;resource&gt;META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSource&lt;/resource&gt;\n                                &lt;/transformer&gt;\n                            &lt;/transformers&gt;\n                        &lt;/configuration&gt;\n                    &lt;/execution&gt;\n                &lt;/executions&gt;\n            &lt;/plugin&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which ideally should merge both META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSource files from the shared library and child project, but this did not work.</p>\n<p>Any suggestions on how to merge both META-INF/services/org.eclipse.microprofile.config.spi.ConfigSource files from shared library and child project?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","gradle","intellij-idea"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1119690,"reputation":15787,"user_id":1108305,"accept_rate":47,"display_name":"M.

Based on what I experienced, the two are not the same. The first method, with batching is the safer solution, but I also found it to be much slower. \r\n\r\nI recognize the that this is not the way that is recommended for implementing something that accepts user inputs, but for my use case, it was the first tractable solution that I found. \r\n\r\nMy use case was this: I had a civ with 21 million rows that I wanted to upload to my database, and I found that using prepared statement batches was much slower. As far as I can tell, this is because each insert statement is added separately to the batch, and so having batch of 1000 executes 1000 insert statements. Whatever the case, this was taking about 30 seconds per batch for me with batch sizes of 1000. With 21 million rows, that would have taken two days. Therefore, I deliberately did something UNSAFE that worked much faster. \r\n\r\nWhen I did it this way, each batch of 10,000 took about 0.25 seconds. This ran enough (1000x) faster than the other way that I thought I would share it for people that are looking for the same answer I was. \r\n\r\nFor reference, the CSV file that I was using was downloaded from https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets.html.\r\n\r\nThe readCSV function was from Jeronimo Backes&#39;s solution here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47275132/slow-csv-row-parsing-and-splitting.\r\nhttps://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.univocity/univocity-parsers\r\n\r\n**Again, don&#39;t do something like this for a solution where you are worried about injection attacks.

Based on what I experienced, the two are not the same. The first method, with batching is the safer solution, but I also found it to be much slower.</p>\n<p>I recognize the that this is not the way that is recommended for implementing something that accepts user inputs, but for my use case, it was the first tractable solution that I found.</p>\n<p>My use case was this: I had a civ with 21 million rows that I wanted to upload to my database, and I found that using prepared statement batches was much slower. As far as I can tell, this is because each insert statement is added separately to the batch, and so having batch of 1000 executes 1000 insert statements. Whatever the case, this was taking about 30 seconds per batch for me with batch sizes of 1000. With 21 million rows, that would have taken two days. Therefore, I deliberately did something UNSAFE that worked much faster.</p>\n<p>When I did it this way, each batch of 10,000 took about 0.25 seconds.

I think you'd find it easier than it was in your GridLayout approach.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":11443964,"reputation":23,"user_id":8388500,"display_name":"TheRussianPatzer"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1374,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":45645305,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1683043449,"creation_date":1502492214,"question_id":45644828,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m new to Android development so I&#39;ve been working on a chess app in order to teach myself.
