In a multiple producer / single consumer scenario, the consumer will not contend with the producers. This queue does have contention when multiple producers try to <code>offer()</code>, but that's concurrency by definition. It's basically a general purpose and efficient non-blocking queue.</p>\n\n<p>As for it not being a <code>BlockingQueue</code>, well, blocking a thread to wait on a queue is a freakishly terrible way of designing concurrent systems. Don't. If you can't figure out how to use a <code>ConcurrentLinkedQueue</code> in a consumer/producer scenario, then just switch to higher-level abstractions, like a good actor framework.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4262789,"reputation":4632,"user_id":3486720,"accept_rate":36,"display_name":"Apurva Singh"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1685028486,"creation_date":1685028486,"answer_id":76333970,"question_id":1426754,"body_markdown":"ConcurrentLinkedQueue.poll uses CAS to maintain thread safety.&lt;br&gt;\r\nLinkedBlockingQueue.poll uses ReentrantLock!

Each layer except the application has two interfaces: the downward interface (to the lower-numbered layer) and the upward interface (to the higher-numbered layer).

Maven shade explodes the BouncyCastle jar file which puts the signatures into META-INF, but the BouncyCastle signatures aren't valid for a new, uber-jar (only for the BC jar), and <strong>that's what causes the Invalid signature error in this thread</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, excluding or deleting the signatures as suggested by @ruhsuzbaykus does indeed make the original error go away, but it can also lead to new, cryptic errors:</p>\n\n<pre><code>java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException: PBEWithSHA256And256BitAES-CBC-BC SecretKeyFactory not available\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>By explicitly specifying where to find the algorithm like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(\"PBEWithSHA256And256BitAES-CBC-BC\",\"BC\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I was able to get a different error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>java.security.NoSuchProviderException: JCE cannot authenticate the provider BC\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>JCE can't authenticate the provider because we've deleted the cryptographic signatures</strong> <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/6743609/5786226\">by following the suggestion elsewhere in this same thread</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The solution I found was the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/44226166/5786226\">executable packer</a> plugin that uses a jar-in-jar approach to <strong>preserve the BouncyCastle signature</strong> in a single, executable jar.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</h2>\n\n<p>Another way to do this (the correct way?) is to use <a href=\"http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-jarsigner-plugin/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maven Jar signer</a>. This allows you to keep using Maven shade without getting security errors. HOWEVER, you must have a code signing certificate (Oracle suggests searching for \"Java Code Signing Certificate\").

This is interesting to me because `ArrayBlockingQueue` uses a `ReentrantLock` internally - and we have already seen the documentation for ReentrantLock to be much more detailed.

The synthetic method and the method handle in the constant pool both contain the generic type (if the lambda uses the type or is explicit as in your examples). \r\n\r\nNow at runtime the `LambdaMetaFactory` is called and a class is generated using ASM that implements the functional interface and the body of the method then calls the private static method with any arguments passed. It is then injected into the original class using `Unsafe.defineAnonymousClass` (see [John Rose post][2]) so it can access the private members etc.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the generated Class does not store the generic signatures (it could) so you can&#39;t use the usual reflection methods that allow you to get around erasure\r\n\r\nFor a normal Class you could inspect the bytecode using `Class.getResource(ClassName + &quot;.class&quot;)` but for anonymous classes defined using `Unsafe` you are out of luck. However you can make the `LambdaMetaFactory` dump them out with the JVM argument:\r\n\r\n    java -Djdk.internal.lambda.dumpProxyClasses=/some/folder\r\n\r\nBy looking at the dumped class file (using `javap -p -s -v`), one can see that it does indeed call the static method. But the problem remains how to get the bytecode from within Java itself. \r\n\r\n**This unfortunately is where it gets hackie:**\r\n\r\nUsing reflection we can call `Class.getConstantPool` and then access the MethodRefInfo to get the type descriptors. We can then use ASM to parse this and return the argument types. Putting it all together:\r\n\r\n    Method getConstantPool = Class.class.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;getConstantPool&quot;);\r\n    getConstantPool.setAccessible(true);\r\n    ConstantPool constantPool = (ConstantPool) getConstantPool.invoke(lambda.getClass());\r\n    String[] methodRefInfo = constantPool.getMemberRefInfoAt(constantPool.size() - 2);\r\n    \r\n    int argumentIndex = 0;\r\n    String argumentType = jdk.internal.org.objectweb.asm.Type.getArgumentTypes(methodRef[2])[argumentIndex].getClassName();\r\n    Class&lt;?&gt; type = (Class&lt;?&gt;) Class.forName(argumentType);\r\n\r\n**UPDATED with Jonathan&#39;s suggestion**\r\n\r\nNow ideally the classes generated by `LambdaMetaFactory` should store the generic type signatures (I might see if I can submit a patch to the OpenJDK) but currently this is the best we can do.

The synthetic method and the method handle in the constant pool both contain the generic type (if the lambda uses the type or is explicit as in your examples). </p>\n\n<p>Now at runtime the <code>LambdaMetaFactory</code> is called and a class is generated using ASM that implements the functional interface and the body of the method then calls the private static method with any arguments passed. It is then injected into the original class using <code>Unsafe.defineAnonymousClass</code> (see <a href=\"https://blogs.oracle.com/jrose/entry/anonymous_classes_in_the_vm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">John Rose post</a>) so it can access the private members etc.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately the generated Class does not store the generic signatures (it could) so you can't use the usual reflection methods that allow you to get around erasure</p>\n\n<p>For a normal Class you could inspect the bytecode using <code>Class.getResource(ClassName + \".class\")</code> but for anonymous classes defined using <code>Unsafe</code> you are out of luck. However you can make the <code>LambdaMetaFactory</code> dump them out with the JVM argument:</p>\n\n<pre><code>java -Djdk.internal.lambda.dumpProxyClasses=/some/folder\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>By looking at the dumped class file (using <code>javap -p -s -v</code>), one can see that it does indeed call the static method. But the problem remains how to get the bytecode from within Java itself. </p>\n\n<p><strong>This unfortunately is where it gets hackie:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Using reflection we can call <code>Class.getConstantPool</code> and then access the MethodRefInfo to get the type descriptors. We can then use ASM to parse this and return the argument types. Putting it all together:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Method getConstantPool = Class.class.getDeclaredMethod(\"getConstantPool\");\ngetConstantPool.setAccessible(true);\nConstantPool constantPool = (ConstantPool) getConstantPool.invoke(lambda.getClass());\nString[] methodRefInfo = constantPool.getMemberRefInfoAt(constantPool.size() - 2);\n\nint argumentIndex = 0;\nString argumentType = jdk.internal.org.objectweb.asm.Type.getArgumentTypes(methodRef[2])[argumentIndex].getClassName();\nClass&lt;?&gt; type = (Class&lt;?&gt;) Class.forName(argumentType);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATED with Jonathan's suggestion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Now ideally the classes generated by <code>LambdaMetaFactory</code> should store the generic type signatures (I might see if I can submit a patch to the OpenJDK) but currently this is the best we can do.
