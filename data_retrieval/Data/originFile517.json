Spring automatically maps the incoming JSON to a Java object. Now, we want to check if the incoming Java object meets our requirements. We should use `spring-boot-starter-validation` dependency that brings bean validation api.

By default, Spring Data uses Hibernate underneath, which supports Bean Validation out of the box.

As a TCP socket (blocking or non-blocking) represents a connection to a **single** remote host, it can only send and receive data from that host. So if you have 1 thread serving more than 1 connection, i.e. more than 1 socket instance per thread, than if one of them blocks, the remaining won&#39;t get served. So you need a model of 1 thread per connection (i.e. socket instance), but this doesn&#39;t scale well because each thread comes at a cost (famous C10k problem).\r\n\r\nNon-blocking solves the issue by having 1 thread serving many TCP connections. In Java parlance, a Selector is able to tell when **at least** one Channel is ready for IO and tell which Channels are ready. A Selector in non-blocking IO is a multiplexer across many TCP sockets.\r\n\r\nNow, in UDP, a `DatagramSocket` already acts as a multiplexer.\r\nA single (blocking) UDP socket can receive (and send) datagrams from any remote host, so when I do\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport java.net.{DatagramPacket, DatagramSocket}\r\n\r\nval udpSocket = new DatagramSocket(&lt;some-port&gt;)\r\ndef run(): Unit = {\r\n  val packet = new Datagrampacket(new Array[Byte](150), 150)\r\n  udpSocket.receive(packet)\r\n  // datagram contains the source IP and port.\r\n  // do something with the datagram\r\n  run()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe blocking `receive` will return when I receive data from **ANY** remote UDP socket. So the behavior that is only achievable with non-blocking channels/selectors in TCP, can be achieved by blocking UDP due to the nature of UDP.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?\r\n\r\n1. If so, why do we also have the concept of non-blocking UDP connections in Java? What value do they add?\r\n2. I imagine the underlying OS also has that construct?

As I see in your code, you have two different collections, `trainers` and `trainees`. Which in your case, doesn&#39;t help much, because you have to perform two different checks.\r\n\r\nSo in your case, I would recommend a schema with a single collection that looks like this:\r\n\r\n    db\r\n    |\r\n    --- users (collection)\r\n         |\r\n         --- $email (document)\r\n               |\r\n               --- type: &quot;trainee&quot;\r\n               |\r\n               --- //other user fields\r\n\r\nTo check if a user is a trainer or a trainee, you only have to create a reference that points to the user document, read the document, and check the type of the user like this:\r\n\r\n    FirebaseFirestore db = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance();\r\n    CollectionReference usersRef = db.collection(&quot;users&quot;);\r\n    DocumentReference emailRef = usersRef.document(email);\r\n    emailRef.get().addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener&lt;DocumentSnapshot&gt;() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onComplete(@NonNull Task&lt;DocumentSnapshot&gt; task) {\r\n            if (task.isSuccessful()) {\r\n                DocumentSnapshot document = task.getResult();\r\n                if (document.exists()) {\r\n                    String type = document.getString(&quot;type&quot;);\r\n                    if(type.equals(&quot;trainer&quot;)) {\r\n                        //Do something.\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        //Do something else.\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            } else {\r\n                Log.d(TAG, task.getException().getMessage()); //Never ignore potential errors!\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you call [DocumentReference#get()][1], the type of object that is returned is a `Task&lt;DocumentSnapshot&gt;`. So in order to get the result, you have to attach a listener, which is an asynchronous operation There is no way you can make that operation synchronous. This means that you cannot return the result of an asynchronous operation as a result of the method.

Therefore, when calculating the average, it&#39;s using the sum of all grades instead of the sum of grades for the specific discipline.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, you need to create a list of lists to store the grades for each discipline separately. You can modify the code as follows:\r\n\r\n    package graduation;\r\n    \r\n    import java.util.ArrayList;\r\n    import java.util.List;\r\n    import java.util.Scanner;\r\n    \r\n    public class GraduationGrade {\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            List&lt;String&gt; disciplines = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n            List&lt;List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; disciplineGrades = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n            List&lt;Integer&gt; disciplineAverages = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    \r\n            while(true) {\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Please enter a discipline or type EXIT&quot;);\r\n                Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n                String discipline = sc.next();\r\n    \r\n                if(discipline.equals(&quot;EXIT&quot;)) {\r\n                    System.out.println(&quot;    DISCIPLINE      GRADES          AVERAGE &quot;);\r\n                    for (int j = 0; j &lt; disciplines.size(); j++) {\r\n                        List&lt;Integer&gt; grades = disciplineGrades.get(j);\r\n                        int sum = grades.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum();\r\n                        int average = sum / grades.size();\r\n                        System.out.println((j + 1) + &quot;      &quot; + disciplines.get(j) + &quot;       &quot; + grades.toString() + &quot;         &quot; + average);\r\n                    }\r\n                    break;\r\n                } else {\r\n                    System.out.println(&quot;Please enter how many grades do you have for &quot; + discipline);\r\n                    sc = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n                    int gradeNumbers = sc.nextInt();\r\n    \r\n                    List&lt;Integer&gt; grades = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n                    for (int i = 0; i &lt; gradeNumbers; i++) {\r\n                        System.out.println(&quot;Please enter your grade for &quot; + discipline + &quot; (between 4 and 10)&quot;);\r\n                        sc = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n                        int grade = sc.nextInt();\r\n                        grades.add(grade);\r\n                    }\r\n    \r\n                    disciplines.add(discipline);\r\n                    disciplineGrades.add(grades);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis code creates a ```List&lt;List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;``` called ```disciplineGrades``` to hold the grades for each discipline.

Upon each `while` loop iteration, you are declaring a new Scanner object. You only need the one Scanner, so declare it in the members area so that it can be used globally throughout the entire class. You are also declaring a new Scanner for ever prompt (`sc = new Scanner(System.in);`)... try not to do that.\r\n\r\nInstead of using a bunch of Lists, use one List of Discipline (`List&lt;Discipline&gt;`). Create a **Discipline** object class instead and use that for your **one** List.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s also a good idea to validate a User&#39;s entry within all prompts to that User so as not to encounter any errors down the road. You will notice in the supplied runnable code, I like to only use the [Scanner#nextLine()](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/util/scanner_nextline.htm) method for all alpha, numerical, or alphanumerical entry prompts. This however, is a personal choice since I find it to be the most flexible and I don&#39;t need to utilize *Try/Catch* mechanisms for prompt validations. \r\n\r\nThe runnable code below makes use of a Discipline class. Although in the demo code below, it is an *inner class*, it should really be a **.java** class file of its own. Here is the runnable code. Be sure to read all the comments in code. If you like, You can delete those comments when you are done with them since too many comments can be rather obtrusive.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\r\nimport java.util.Arrays;\r\nimport java.util.Collections;\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\nimport java.util.Scanner;\r\n\r\npublic class GraduationGrade {\r\n    \r\n    // Member variables:\r\n    // OS related newline character sequence.\r\n    private final String ls = System.lineSeparator();\r\n    \r\n    /* Open a keyboard input Stream.

Upon each <code>while</code> loop iteration, you are declaring a new Scanner object. You only need the one Scanner, so declare it in the members area so that it can be used globally throughout the entire class. You are also declaring a new Scanner for ever prompt (<code>sc = new Scanner(System.in);</code>)... try not to do that.</p>\n<p>Instead of using a bunch of Lists, use one List of Discipline (<code>List&lt;Discipline&gt;</code>). Create a <strong>Discipline</strong> object class instead and use that for your <strong>one</strong> List.</p>\n<p>It's also a good idea to validate a User's entry within all prompts to that User so as not to encounter any errors down the road. You will notice in the supplied runnable code, I like to only use the <a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/util/scanner_nextline.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Scanner#nextLine()</a> method for all alpha, numerical, or alphanumerical entry prompts. This however, is a personal choice since I find it to be the most flexible and I don't need to utilize <em>Try/Catch</em> mechanisms for prompt validations.</p>\n<p>The runnable code below makes use of a Discipline class. Although in the demo code below, it is an <em>inner class</em>, it should really be a <strong>.java</strong> class file of its own. Here is the runnable code. Be sure to read all the comments in code. If you like, You can delete those comments when you are done with them since too many comments can be rather obtrusive.</p>\n<pre><code>import java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.Collections;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class GraduationGrade {\n    \n    // Member variables:\n    // OS related newline character sequence.\n    private final String ls = System.lineSeparator();\n    \n    /* Open a keyboard input Stream.

Spring Boot auto-configuration attempts to automatically configure your Spring application based on the jar dependencies that you have added. For your reference, you can see all the starters here- https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-starters\r\n\r\nSpring Boot can also auto-configure the dataSource bean, depending on the database you&#39;re using. Now instead of using `spring-data-jpa`, you should add `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`. Even you do NOT need to add `spring-boot-starter-jdbc` as it already comes with `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`. In the same way, you should check if the dependencies like Jakarta, jackson, jaxb are already added by `spring-boot-starter-web` then you do not need to add those explicitly.\r\n\r\nIf you are new to Spring-Boot then for your reference start from here\r\n\r\n    Spring boot reference guide:-\r\n    \r\n    Web- [https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/web.html#web][1] \r\n    Data- [https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/data.html][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/data.html","title":"Error when running DemoApplication.java -dependencies","body":"<p>First of all, you should have added more description to your question such as what you are trying to do along with some code snippet.

It doesn&#39;t have to be active (in that there is a separate `.connect()` method, and things like `.getInputStream()` implicitly connect if it isn&#39;t already), and it can be to anything - a file, a resource in a jar, a BLOB in an SQL-based database, or a connection to a webserver, which is what is happening here.\r\n\r\nSuch connections can be two-way (where you can send data to them, as well as receive data from them) but doesn&#39;t have to be. Web connections are one-way, unless it&#39;s a POST call, such as when you submit a web form, where it&#39;s two way (you send the form data, which might be a lot if it includes a file upload element, and then you receive the response).\r\n\r\n## InputStream\r\n\r\nAs produced by `con.getInputStream()`. An InputStream is a thing that can produce a stream of bytes. It may be endless (for example, a stream that produces random numbers, as many as you want, or a web connection, which could be endless if the server decides to serve bytes as long as you continue to ask for them), but more usually it will end. You don&#39;t know when - another property of inputstreams is that the source that provides these bytes doesn&#39;t have to tell you in advance if it will ever end or when that will happen.\r\n\r\n`con.getInputStream()` represents the data that the server sends. It&#39;s _just_ the data - the &#39;raw data&#39; sent directly by a webserver includes headers and the like. `con.getInputStream()` represents __only__ the &#39;payload&#39; - for example, when connecting to `https://www.pravda.ru/` (if for some reason you want to do that), `con.getInputStream()` returns an `InputStream` that gives you the HTML.\r\n\r\n## InputStreamReader\r\n\r\nInputStream provides __bytes__ and bytes are not characters. If you&#39;re receiving ASCII, there is virtually no difference between bytes and characters, but, it&#39;s 2023, and there are way more characters than that, so, for example, most websites are sent as UTF-8 where 1 to 4 bytes represents a character. `Reader` is to `InputStream` as &#39;character&#39; is to &#39;byte&#39; - where `InputStream` gives you bytes until the stream is done, a `Reader` gives you `char`s until it is done.\r\n\r\nAn `InputStreamReader` bridges them - it turns an inputstream into a reader, by giving it an `InputStream`, and a charset encoding. This code provides a non-standard way to say &quot;it is UTF-8&quot;. `StandardCharsets.UTF8` is the standard way, `&quot;UTF8&quot;` is less standard (if you typo `UTF8`, you won&#39;t know until you run it, whereas if you typo `StandardCharsets.UTF8` you know as you type, because your editor will immediately red-wavy-underline it).\r\n\r\n## BufferedReader\r\n\r\nOne &#39;issue&#39; that connections can have is that they have peculiar chunking behaviour. For example, on just about any disk system (be it a spinning disk or a bunch of SSD cells) __cannot__ give you single bytes. It can only give you fairly large chunks of them. This is a problem: If your code processes things one at a time, then an InputStream has to be allowed to be really wasteful (read an entire disk sector in, and then toss em all in the garbage except the one byte you asked for), because the alternative requires that the object allocate a bunch of RAM to store that stuff. Usually you&#39;d want it to do that, but every so often you don&#39;t. Of course, if you &#39;wrap&#39; that `InputStream` into a Reader with `InputStreamReader` you run into the same problem.\r\n\r\n`BufferedReader` lets you opt into: Yes, please allocate memory for efficiency. a BufferedReader wraps around a Reader and doesn&#39;t change anything at all (it has the same methods - it is also a `Reader`), except its spec indicates that if you call `read()` (which returns a single character), under the hood BufferedReader actually grabs a whole boatload of them, gives you the first one, and stores the rest in an internal cache, and will continue to use that cache as you call `read()` until it has run dry in which case It&#39;ll ask the underlying InputStreamReader for a bunch more. Which will in turn call its underlying InputStream (which you got from `con.getInputStream()`) for a bunch of bytes.\r\n\r\n## URL\r\n\r\nA URL Is a &quot;Universal Resource Locator&quot;. It&#39;s a spec for writing a structured line of text  that identifies a resource _and_ how to load it. The web uses URLs - it&#39;s what you can type into a browser to tell it where to connect to and what to get from there. `https://www.independent.co.uk/europe` is a URL that represents:\r\n\r\n* `https` - use the https protocol to connect to a server to fetch this resource.\r\n* `www.independent.co.uk` - ask the DNS server (where is that? The system knows. Which it knows because when it connected to the network, the router in your closet or whatnot told it where it is) for the IP address that goes with `www.independent.co.uk`, then connect to that IP.\r\n* `/europe` - and ask the server that answers there for this resource.\r\n\r\nURLs don&#39;t _have_ to describe web pages. `file:///foo/bar/baz` is a URL. So is `ftp://ftp.foobar.com/path/to/some/file`. So is `my-bank-app://whatever` which is how iPhones and android let websites open apps. It&#39;s a very flexible system. It&#39;s essentially `someprotocol://someserver/someresourceidentifier` where all those 3 things can be just about anything.\r\n\r\n","title":"What is InputStreamReader really? and URL?","body":"<h2>URLConnection</h2>\n<p>A highly abstract thing - it represents a connection to a URL.
