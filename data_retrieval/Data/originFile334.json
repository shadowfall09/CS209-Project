This data storage has nothing to do with how spreadsheet data normally are stored in a sheet. It looks as if someone tried mimic the JSON in the sheet. That&#39;s unusual, but so be it.\r\n\r\nSheets are stored row by row. And in your case each row may have one cell stored with following meaning:\r\n\r\n - If first cell in row, then this is the key of the level 1 object.\r\n - If second cell in row, then this is the key of the level 2 object.\r\n - If third cell in row, then this is a item of the level 3 array.\r\n - The level 1 object maps a list of n level 2 objects to the key.\r\n - The level 2 object maps a list of n level 3 arrays to the key.\r\n - The level 3 array contais n array items each.\r\n\r\nKnowing this, the simplest way to produce JSON from this will be using a StringBuilder to append the found keys and/or array items delimeted with opening and closing tags. To open an object, &quot;{&quot; gets used. To open an array, &quot;[&quot; gets used. To close an object, when another follows, &quot;},&quot; gets used. To close an array, when another follows, &quot;],&quot; gets used. To close an object, when no other follows, &quot;}&quot; gets used. To close an array, when no other follows, &quot;]&quot; gets used. Array items are opened with no tag and closed using &quot;,&quot; when another follows and using no tag, when no other folows.\r\n\r\nThe following code implements that logic.

In this case, you&#39;re saying &quot;I realise that the `lookup()` method is declared to return `Object`, but when I call it in this particular context I&#39;m sure that it will always specifically return an `IPcdContext` object.&quot;  Your assumption here turned out not to hold, and the program correctly signals this by throwing the exception.\r\n\r\nThere are potential two causes to your problem:\r\n\r\n 1. Your assumption is correct in general, but due to a logic bug you&#39;re not passing in the string you expect to the `lookup` method, and so are getting the wrong thing back altogether.  In this case, ensure that the parameter passed to the method is always correct.\r\n 1. Your assumption is incorrect, and you might *not* always get an `IPcdContext` back.  In this case, you&#39;ll need to decide what to do with other objects that are returned, and deal with them appropriately (you can use the `instanceof` operator to check the class of the returned object).\r\n\r\nIn any case, whenever you do a cast it&#39;s usually beneficial to check that it will succeed first, with an idiom like:\r\n\r\n    IPcdContext context;\r\n    Object obj = context.lookup(&quot;foo&quot;);\r\n    if (obj instanceof IPcdContext) {\r\n        context = (IPcdContext)obj;\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        // You got back something else.

am using OpenApi to generate java client code using a spring webclient. \r\nThis offers an MergedApi class .\r\n```java\r\n@Bean\r\npublic MergedApi mergedApi(final ApiClient apiClient) {\r\n  return new MergedApi(apiClient);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo add my token to the ApiClient, I need to use following dependencies: \r\n\r\n```xml\r\n   &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n

`org.lognet.springboot.grpc.security.GrpcSecurityConfigurerAdapter`: \r\n```java \r\n  @Override\r\n  public void configure(GrpcSecurity builder) throws Exception {\r\n    try {\r\n      final

builder.authorizeRequests().withSecuredAnnotation();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nSo apparently when no JwtDecoder-Bean exists, the whole Application crashed and thankfully this error is thrown somewhere completely else since this catch block is empty.\r\nI added manually the JwtDecoder and the necessary dependency for it: \r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public JwtDecoder decoder() {\r\n

Now there seem to be two options, but basically only one will remain. I&#39;ll explain below.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you&#39;d think that using a `Signature` with `&quot;NoneWithRSA&quot;` should work. The algorithm does exist, but unfortunately it still pads; it just strips the ASN.1 structure indicating the hash function and value. So that one is not available.\r\n\r\nAlthough [signing is not the same as encryption](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/15997/is-rsa-encryption-of-a-cryptographic-hash-with-a-private-key-the-same-as-signatu), both operations in the end rely on modular exponentiation.

Instead of just removing the padding, it also *forgets to put the ciphertext through the I2OSP algorithm* (see the PKCS#1 standard), which properly encodes to the output size of the modulus. So you can have a smaller ciphertext than 128 bytes for specific key / plaintext combinations. This is very easy to see by encrypting the value 0, where the output will be zero bytes.\r\n\r\nFinally note that specifying `Cipher.ENCRYPT` mode or `Cipher.DECRYPT` mode doesn&#39;t make a difference; both simply perform modular exponentiation.

So you can have a smaller ciphertext than 128 bytes for specific key / plaintext combinations. This is very easy to see by encrypting the value 0, where the output will be zero bytes.</p>\n\n<p>Finally note that specifying <code>Cipher.ENCRYPT</code> mode or <code>Cipher.DECRYPT</code> mode doesn't make a difference; both simply perform modular exponentiation. However, Cipher.DECRYPT is more likely to expect a private key, which is why I used it in above code.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>You can generate a key pair for testing above code like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>KeyPairGenerator kpg = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance(\"RSA\");\nkpg.initialize(1024);\nKeyPair kp = kpg.generateKeyPair();\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Warning</strong>: signature generation without secure padding is insecure; <a href=\"https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/12780/1172\">it may result in existential forgery attacks</a>.
