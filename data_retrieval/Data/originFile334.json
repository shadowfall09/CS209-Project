The program passes an employee number to the function. The function returns the corresponding Employee object. To retrieve this object you do the following:\r\n\r\n1.Prepare an OracleCallableStatement to call the GETEMPLOYEE function, as follows:\r\n\r\n     OracleCallableStatement ocs = (OracleCallableStatement)conn.prepareCall(&quot;{ ? = call GETEMPLOYEE(?) }&quot;);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.Declare the empnumber as the input parameter to GETEMPLOYEE. Register the SQLData object as the OUT parameter, with the type code OracleTypes.STRUCT. Then, run the statement. This can be done as follows:\r\n\r\n     ocs.setInt(2, empnumber); \r\n     ocs.registerOutParameter(1, OracleTypes.STRUCT, &quot;EMP_OBJECT&quot;); \r\n    ocs.execute(); \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.Use the getObject method to retrieve the employee object. The following code assumes that there is a type map entry to map the Oracle object to the Java type Employee:\r\n\r\n     Employee emp = (Employee)ocs.getObject(1); //my comment--&gt;this doesn&#39;t seem to work\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is no type map entry, then getObject would return an oracle.sql.STRUCT object. Cast the output to the STRUCT type, because the getObject method returns an instance of the generic java.lang.Object class. This is done as follows:\r\n\r\n    STRUCT emp = (STRUCT)ocs.getObject(1); \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"Mapping an Oracle stored procedure result to a custom Java type (class)","body":"<p>I have to call a stored procedure in Oracle (11g) that uses a single IN OUT parameter.

I can successfully\ncall the Oracle procedure with an instance of TNapraviNalog (  stmt.setObject(1, paramValues.get(0) ); ) but I can't get the result converted to TNapraviNalog. I really would like\nto be able to have something like</p>\n\n<pre><code> TNapraviNalog nalog = stmt.getObject(1, m); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, this line will cause an exception ( <strong>java.lang.ClassCastException: oracle.sql.STRUCT cannot be cast to ib.easyorm.db.TNapraviNalog</strong>).\nI'm guessing that the JDBC driver isn't aware of the actual type returned by the stmt.getObject(1,m) and thus can't make the conversion.</p>\n\n<p>Does anybody know if this can be done using either plain JDBC or Hibernate?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT: The relevant code from an Oracle page</strong> (link given in cihan seven's answer)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Retrieving SQLData Objects from a Callable Statement OUT Parameter</strong></p>\n\n<p>Consider you have an OracleCallableStatement instance, ocs, that calls a PL/SQL function GETEMPLOYEE. The program passes an employee number to the function. The function returns the corresponding Employee object. To retrieve this object you do the following:</p>\n\n<p>1.Prepare an OracleCallableStatement to call the GETEMPLOYEE function, as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code> OracleCallableStatement ocs = (OracleCallableStatement)conn.prepareCall(\"{ ? = call GETEMPLOYEE(?) }\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>2.Declare the empnumber as the input parameter to GETEMPLOYEE. Register the SQLData object as the OUT parameter, with the type code OracleTypes.STRUCT. Then, run the statement. This can be done as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code> ocs.setInt(2, empnumber); \n ocs.registerOutParameter(1, OracleTypes.STRUCT, \"EMP_OBJECT\"); \nocs.execute(); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>3.Use the getObject method to retrieve the employee object. The following code assumes that there is a type map entry to map the Oracle object to the Java type Employee:</p>\n\n<pre><code> Employee emp = (Employee)ocs.getObject(1); //my comment--&gt;this doesn't seem to work\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If there is no type map entry, then getObject would return an oracle.sql.STRUCT object. Cast the output to the STRUCT type, because the getObject method returns an instance of the generic java.lang.Object class. This is done as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>STRUCT emp = (STRUCT)ocs.getObject(1); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thank you</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","apache-kafka","ksqldb"],"owner":{"account_id":6780685,"reputation":445,"user_id":5255911,"display_name":"MaduKan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1688377352,"creation_date":1688377352,"question_id":76603571,"body_markdown":"I created a stream with the KSQLDB client Java:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        CompletableFuture&lt;ExecuteStatementResult&gt; execFuture = client.executeStatement(\r\n                &quot;CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM IF NOT EXISTS PAGEVIEWS &quot; +\r\n                &quot;(PAGE_ID BIGINT, VIEWTIME BIGINT, USER_ID STRING) &quot; +\r\n                &quot;WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC=&#39;keyless-pageviews-topic&#39;, &quot; +\r\n                &quot;KEY_FORMAT=&#39;KAFKA&#39;, PARTITIONS=1, VALUE_FORMAT=&#39;JSON&#39;);&quot;,\r\n                properties\r\n        );\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when I try to read the data with the same Java client I can&#39;t see the data.

In compute, it knows that the put\ncall is &quot;coming&quot;, so it can save the hash.  Similarly in other implementations, once the key has been &quot;located&quot;, it will be reused, rather than being looked up again.  The main algorithmic cost of this operation is in the lookup, so doing it once is better than doing it twice.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, between 2 and 3, there are good reasons to use compute.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":22182114,"reputation":1,"user_id":16425668,"display_name":"Yokesh Chowdary"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1688374237,"creation_date":1688374051,"answer_id":76603198,"question_id":70430071,"body_markdown":"As **@John Kugelman** explained above, **put() is more efficient than compute().** \r\n\r\nApart from explanation, Below are few observations from my side:\r\n\r\nThere are 2 cases where we can compare set() and compute()\r\n\r\n - If key is present in hash map\r\n - If key is not present in hash map\r\n\r\n**set(key,value):** If key is not present in hash map, the key with value is added to the hash map and set() method returns &quot;none&quot;.\r\n\r\n**set(key,value):** If key is present in hash map, the new value will be replaced in place of old value and set() returns &quot;old value&quot;.\r\n\r\n**compute(key,BiFunction biFunction):** If key is not present in hash map, the key with value is added to to the hash map and compute() method retuns &quot;new value&quot;. \r\n\r\n**compute(key, BiFunction biFunction):** If key is present in hash map, the new value will be replaced in place of old value and compute() returns &quot;new value&quot;\r\n\r\n        Map&lt;String,Integer&gt; ss = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(Map.of(&quot;A&quot;,10,&quot;B&quot;,20));\r\n        System.out.println(ss.put(&quot;C&quot;,30)); // none\r\n        System.out.println(ss); // {A=10, B=20, C=30}\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(ss.put(&quot;A&quot;,11)); // 10\r\n        System.out.println(ss); // {A=11, B=20, C=30}\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(ss.compute(&quot;D&quot;,(x,y)-&gt;40)); // 40\r\n        System.out.println(ss); // {D=40, A=11, B=20, C=30}\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(ss.compute(&quot;B&quot;,(x,y)-&gt;y+10)); // 30\r\n        System.out.println(ss); // {A=11, B=30, C=30, D=40}\r\n\r\n - Internally compute() uses set().

However, there is no need to do that since the runtime will close it automatically when the program exits.</p>\n<p>PS: on a separate note, if you do want or need to close something you should normally use a <code>try..finally</code> or <code>try-with-resources</code> statement to ensure that the statement is not skipped in the case of exception which could lead to memory or resource leaks.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":25904485,"reputation":23,"user_id":19629760,"display_name":"George S."},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":76602236,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1688366356,"creation_date":1688364540,"question_id":76602205,"body_markdown":"\r\nI have a Top-level public class with an inner class being created in that same class by creating an instance of the top-level class and then creating an instance of the inner class in that instance of the top-level class.\r\n\r\nThe issue I&#39;m running into is that after I create the Scanner object and try to run the `next()` method, is that the program doesn&#39;t allow for the terminal to input anything and then throws an error for there not being a token for it to pick up on.\r\n\r\nI have tried using the `hasNext()` method and using try_catch.

To profit from this support you need to:\r\n\r\n1. Register a [`ThreadLocalAccessor`](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.micrometer/context-propagation/latest/io/micrometer/context/ThreadLocalAccessor.html) that will help transfering the correlation id from Log4j&#39;s `ThreadContext` from and to various context objects:\r\n   ```lang-java\r\n   private static final String CORRELATION_ID = &quot;correlationId&quot;;\r\n   ...\r\n   ContextRegistry.getInstance()\r\n       .registerThreadLocalAccessor(\r\n           CORRELATION_ID,\r\n           () -&gt; ThreadContext.get(CORRELATION_ID),\r\n           v -&gt; ThreadContext.put(CORRELATION_ID, v),\r\n           () -&gt; ThreadContext.remove(CORRELATION_ID)\r\n       );\r\n   ```\r\n1. Add one of the `contextWrite/contextCapture` operators at the end of your `WebClient` chain to capture your correlation id into a Reactor [`Context`](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/util/context/Context.html) object:\r\n   ```lang-java\r\n   webClient.get()\r\n            ...\r\n            .contextCapture();\r\n   ```\r\n1. All Reactor Netty pipelines consist of two parts: a sequence of Reactor operators and a sequence of Netty [`ChannelHandler`](https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/channel/ChannelHandler.html)s.  Reactor operators should automatically restore the thread locals, when they jump between threads. At the moment this does not seems to be the case for tasks started by the Netty part. Since `wiretap` works as a Netty handler, inbound events will **not** have a correlation id (only code executed in the Reactor part will have it). In order to correct that you need to restore the context manually via a `ChannelInboundHandler`:\r\n   ```lang-java\r\n   private static final class ContextInboundHandler extends ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter {\r\n\r\n       private static final ContextSnapshotFactory SNAPSHOT_FACTORY = ContextSnapshotFactory.builder()\r\n           .contextRegistry(ContextRegistry.getInstance())\r\n           .build();\r\n\r\n       private static Scope setThreadLocals(ChannelHandlerContext ctx) {\r\n           return SNAPSHOT_FACTORY.setThreadLocalsFrom(ctx.channel());\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       @Override\r\n       public void channelRegistered(ChannelHandlerContext ctx) throws Exception {\r\n           try (final Scope s = setThreadLocals(ctx)) {\r\n               super.channelRegistered(ctx);\r\n           }\r\n       }\r\n   // Same for all other events\r\n   ...\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n   and add it as first Netty inbound Handler:\r\n   ```lang-java\r\n   final HttpClient httpClient = HttpClient.create()\r\n       .wiretap(true)\r\n       .doOnChannelInit((connectionObserver, channel, remoteAddress) -&gt; {\r\n           channel.pipeline()\r\n               .addFirst(&quot;context&quot;, new ContextInboundHandler());\r\n   });\r\n   final WebClient client = WebClient.builder()\r\n       ...\r\n       .clientConnector(new ReactorClientHttpConnector(httpClient))\r\n       .build();\r\n\r\nSupport for `context-propagation` is quite recent in Reactor Netty.
