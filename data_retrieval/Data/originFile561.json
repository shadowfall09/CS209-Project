This feature can be used to achieve the desired result of ensuring no null elements are within a collection or map.\r\n\r\nHibernate Validator 5.2 (which implements Bean Validation 1.2) has limited support for bean validation annotations on type parameters of collection types, though the standard bean validation annotations cannot be used in this manner, nor can such annotations be used on map keys.\r\n\r\n## Bean Validation 2.0/Hibernate Validator 6.0\r\n\r\nBean Validation 2.0 (of which Hibernate Validator 6.0 is the reference implementation) allows using its validation annotations directly on generic type arguments.  This is noted in the [Hibernate 6.0 release documentation](https://hibernate.org/validator/releases/6.0/#bean-validation-2-0):\r\n\r\n&gt; Hibernate Validator 6.0 is the Reference Implementation of the Bean Validation 2.0 specification so it comes with all its new features:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; * First class support of container element constraints and cascaded validation (think `private Map&lt;@Valid @NotNull OrderCategory, List&lt;@Valid @NotNull Order&gt;&gt; orderByCategories;`);\r\n\r\nIf the project is using Java 8 with Bean Validation 2.0, this feature can be used to achieve your stated goals:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList&lt;@NotNull String&gt; noNullsList;\r\nMap&lt;@NotNull String, @NotNull String&gt; noNullKeysOrValuesMap;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Bean Validation 1.2/Hibernate Validator 5.2\r\n\r\nHibernate 5.2 (with Bean Validation 1.2) added a limited version of the feature to allow validation annotations directly on generic type arguments.  However, none of its built-in Bean Validation or Hibernate Validation constraints could be used in this manner, as the annotations do not specify `ElementType.TYPE_USE` for backwards-compatibility reasons.  Additionally, type argument constraints could be specified for map values but not map keys.  This is all described in the [Hibernate Validator 5.2 documentation](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/validator/5.2/reference/en-US/html_single/#type-arguments-constraints):\r\n\r\n&gt; Starting from Java 8, it is possible to specify constraints directly on the type argument of a parameterized type.  However, this requires that `ElementType.TYPE_USE` is specified via `@Target` in the constraint definition.  To maintain backwards compatibility, built-in Bean Validation as well as Hibernate Validator specific constraints do not yet specify `ElementType.TYPE_USE`.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; [...]\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; When applying constraints on an Iterable type argument, Hibernate Validator will validate each element.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; [...]\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Type argument constraints are also validated for map values. Constraints on the key are ignored.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nIn summary, if you are using Java 8 with Bean Validation 2.0 (such as Hibernate Validator 6), you can annotate the generic list &amp; map type arguments with `@NotNull`.\r\n\r\nIf you are using Java 8 with Bean Validation 1.2 and Hibernate Validator 5.2, you can write a custom `@NotNull` validation annotation with `TYPE_USE` in its definition, and apply it to the generic type of the collection or map value.\r\n\r\nIf you are not on Java 8 or are on a version of Hibernate Validator prior to 5.2, you would need a custom constraint to apply to the map or list to verify that every element of the collection or map is non-null.\r\n","title":"java/beans validation - collection/map does not contain nulls","body":"<p>Java 8 added the ability to apply annotations directly to generic type parameters (e.g. <code>private List&lt;@SomeAnnotation String&gt; myList</code>).</p>\n<p>In a Java 8 application, Bean Validation 2.0/Hibernate Validator 6.0 allows using the standard bean validation annotations such as <code>@NotNull</code> on type parameters of collection types to apply that validation to each element in the collection or map.  This feature can be used to achieve the desired result of ensuring no null elements are within a collection or map.</p>\n<p>Hibernate Validator 5.2 (which implements Bean Validation 1.2) has limited support for bean validation annotations on type parameters of collection types, though the standard bean validation annotations cannot be used in this manner, nor can such annotations be used on map keys.</p>\n<h2>Bean Validation 2.0/Hibernate Validator 6.0</h2>\n<p>Bean Validation 2.0 (of which Hibernate Validator 6.0 is the reference implementation) allows using its validation annotations directly on generic type arguments.  This is noted in the <a href=\"https://hibernate.org/validator/releases/6.0/#bean-validation-2-0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hibernate 6.0 release documentation</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hibernate Validator 6.0 is the Reference Implementation of the Bean Validation 2.0 specification so it comes with all its new features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First class support of container element constraints and cascaded validation (think <code>private Map&lt;@Valid @NotNull OrderCategory, List&lt;@Valid @NotNull Order&gt;&gt; orderByCategories;</code>);</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the project is using Java 8 with Bean Validation 2.0, this feature can be used to achieve your stated goals:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>List&lt;@NotNull String&gt; noNullsList;\nMap&lt;@NotNull String, @NotNull String&gt; noNullKeysOrValuesMap;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Bean Validation 1.2/Hibernate Validator 5.2</h2>\n<p>Hibernate 5.2 (with Bean Validation 1.2) added a limited version of the feature to allow validation annotations directly on generic type arguments.  However, none of its built-in Bean Validation or Hibernate Validation constraints could be used in this manner, as the annotations do not specify <code>ElementType.TYPE_USE</code> for backwards-compatibility reasons.  Additionally, type argument constraints could be specified for map values but not map keys.  This is all described in the <a href=\"https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/validator/5.2/reference/en-US/html_single/#type-arguments-constraints\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hibernate Validator 5.2 documentation</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Starting from Java 8, it is possible to specify constraints directly on the type argument of a parameterized type.

One of them ([LED Strip example](https://pi4j.com/examples/components/ledstrip/)) seems like the perfect match for your problem.\r\n\r\nGenerating the required timing for the WS2812 chips with switching a GPIO pin to high / low at the required rate is difficult even when working in C and probably almost impossible when working in Java.\r\n\r\nThe example from pi4j uses the SPI interface to accurately generate the required timing. (Note that the approach taken is different from the one in the elektormagazine that you linked in a comment.)\r\n\r\nThe bit timing for the SPI is set to a basic rate of around 156ns per bit and the data for the WS28xx is produced as follows:\r\n\r\n* a 0 bit for the WS2812 (350ns high followed by 900ns low) is written as 0b1100_0000 (2 bits high -&gt; 312ns, 6 bits low -&gt; 936ns)\r\n* a 1 bit for the WS2812 (900ns high followed by 350ns low) is written as 0xb1111_1000 (5 bits high -&gt; 780ns, 3 bits low -&gt; 468ns low)\r\n\r\nThe timing this produces is well within the specified limits of the WS28xx chips.\r\n\r\nThe example takes the RGB codes for all configured chips and creates a byte array where each byte corresponds to one output bit.
