I have a spatial index of objects where I want to find all objects between a start/end longitude. \r\n\r\nThe longitudes could be duplicates but I still need the ability to efficiently add/remove specific objects from the index. Unfortunately I could not find the Java equivalent of the Python [SortedKeyList][3] that separates the sort key from the type being stored.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this consider that we have a large list of retail purchases and we want to get all purchases where the cost is in a specific range.\r\n\r\n    // We are using TreeSet as a SortedList\r\n    TreeSet _index = new TreeSet&lt;PriceBase&gt;()\r\n\r\n    // populate the index with the purchases. \r\n    // Note that 2 of these have the same cost\r\n    _index.add(new Purchase(&quot;candy&quot;, 1.03));\r\n    Purchase _bananas = new Purchase(&quot;bananas&quot;, 1.45);\r\n    _index.add(new Purchase(_bananas);\r\n    _index.add(new Purchase(&quot;celery&quot;, 1.45));\r\n    _index.add(new Purchase(&quot;chicken&quot;, 4.99));\r\n\r\n    // Range scan.

There is one major criterion:\r\n\r\n* **Encapsulation.** Objects have an API attached to them, typically in such a way that you work with the object more by *telling it what to do* than by running some function on it.\r\n\r\n  Most object-based languages define objects in terms of &quot;classes&quot;, which are basically blueprints for an object.  The class lays out the internal structure of the object and defines the API.\r\n\r\n  This is not the only way, though.  In JavaScript, for example, objects don&#39;t really have &quot;classes&quot;.  Any object can have any properties it wants.  And since functions are first-class values in JavaScript, they can be set as properties on the object, and serve as the object&#39;s API.\r\n\r\nAs far as object-based-but-not-object-oriented languages go, a good example would be Visual Basic (not the .net stuff; i&#39;m talking about VB6 and VBA).  Classes exist, but can&#39;t inherit from each other.\r\n\r\n**Object-oriented** languages are object-based languages that take things a step further.  They have built-in support for the two other pillars of OOP:\r\n\r\n* **Inheritance.** Objects must have the ability to be (and be viewed as) specializations of some other object.  This means, for example, being able to define &quot;Dog&quot; as &quot;Animal that can bark and fetch sticks&quot;.\r\n\r\n  In modern languages, it typically takes the form of one object&#39;s *class* inheriting from another object&#39;s *class*.  This is not a requirement, though; contrary to what some people will try to tell you, the definition of OOP does not require classes at all.\r\n\r\n* **Polymorphism.** &#160;Code must be able to use an object without knowing or caring exactly what type it is.\r\n\r\n Most languages (especially statically typed ones) define polymorphism in terms of classes and inheritance. If you have a class B that inherits from A, code that requires a reference to an A can typically take a B instead, but not some class C that isn&#39;t related to A. Java also has the `interface` keyword, which lets you define a set of behaviors a class must implement.&#160;Any object whose class explicitly `implements X`, and thus implements the functions defined on interface X, qualifies as an instance of type X.\r\n\r\n&#160;Other languages, like JavaScript, let you pass any object you like. As long as the object presents the right interface, it doesn&#39;t matter exactly what kind of object it is. This is called &quot;duck typing&quot;, and it is very nearly the purest form of polymorphism there is.","title":"Core difference between object oriented and object based language","body":"<p><strong>Object-based</strong> languages include basically any language that offers the built-in ability to easily create and use objects.  There is one major criterion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Encapsulation.</strong> Objects have an API attached to them, typically in such a way that you work with the object more by <em>telling it what to do</em> than by running some function on it.</p>\n\n<p>Most object-based languages define objects in terms of \"classes\", which are basically blueprints for an object.  The class lays out the internal structure of the object and defines the API.</p>\n\n<p>This is not the only way, though.  In JavaScript, for example, objects don't really have \"classes\".

Let me know if you still face hurdles.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4907049,"reputation":31,"user_id":3953495,"display_name":"kanwar prince raghav"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1499941706,"creation_date":1499941706,"answer_id":45077991,"question_id":33194384,"body_markdown":"Change the code as per Hibernate 5\r\n\r\n        static\r\n\t    {\r\n\t\t    try {\r\n\t\t\t    //Configuration configuration = new Configuration().configure();\r\n\t            serviceRegistry = new \r\n                StandardServiceRegistryBuilder().configure(&quot;hibernate.cfg.xml&quot;)\r\n\t                                        .build();\r\n\t            Metadata metadata = new MetadataSources(serviceRegistry)\r\n\t                                .getMetadataBuilder().build();\r\n\t            sessionFactory = metadata.getSessionFactoryBuilder().build();\t\r\n\t     \t} catch (Exception e) {\r\n\t\t    \t// TODO: handle exception\r\n\t\t\t    e.printStackTrace();\r\n\t\t    }\r\n\t    }\r\n\t    public static SessionFactory getSessionFactory() {\r\n\t\treturn sessionFactory;\r\n\t    }\r\n\r\ngive the\r\ngive full class path in user.hbm.xml\r\n\r\n         &lt;class name=&quot;com.simpleprogrammer.Users&quot; table=&quot;USERS&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nmap the resource in hibernate.cfg.xml\r\n\r\n          &lt;mapping resource=&quot;com/simpleprogrammer/Users.hbm.xml&quot;/&gt;\r\nand execute the following code\r\n\r\n        Session session = HibernateUtilities.getSessionFactory().openSession();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tsession.beginTransaction();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tUsers user = new Users();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tuser.setuserName(&quot;Prince&quot;);\r\n\t\tuser.setGoal(100);\r\n\t\tuser.setId(101);\r\n\t\tuser.setTotal(10);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tsession.save(user);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tsession.getTransaction().commit(); \r\n\t\tsession.close();\r\n\t\tHibernateUtilities.getSessionFactory().close();","title":"Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; org.hibernate.MappingException: Unknown entity","body":"<p>Change the code as per Hibernate 5</p>\n\n<pre><code>    static\n    {\n        try {\n            //Configuration configuration = new Configuration().configure();\n            serviceRegistry = new \n            StandardServiceRegistryBuilder().configure(\"hibernate.cfg.xml\")\n                                        .build();\n            Metadata metadata = new MetadataSources(serviceRegistry)\n                                .getMetadataBuilder().build();\n            sessionFactory = metadata.getSessionFactoryBuilder().build();   \n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            // TODO: handle exception\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n    public static SessionFactory getSessionFactory() {\n    return sessionFactory;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>give the\ngive full class path in user.hbm.xml</p>\n\n<pre><code>     &lt;class name=\"com.simpleprogrammer.Users\" table=\"USERS\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>map the resource in hibernate.cfg.xml</p>\n\n<pre><code>      &lt;mapping resource=\"com/simpleprogrammer/Users.hbm.xml\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and execute the following code</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Session session = HibernateUtilities.getSessionFactory().openSession();\n\n    session.beginTransaction();\n\n    Users user = new Users();\n\n    user.setuserName(\"Prince\");\n    user.setGoal(100);\n    user.setId(101);\n    user.setTotal(10);\n\n    session.save(user);\n\n    session.getTransaction().commit(); \n    session.close();\n    HibernateUtilities.getSessionFactory().close();\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":10326101,"reputation":968,"user_id":7617526,"display_name":"ABODE"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1560764349,"creation_date":1560764349,"answer_id":56628633,"question_id":33194384,"body_markdown":"The mapping is having a little issue.

But for professional development, you will likely want your project to be modularized so you can use [*jlink*](https://openjdk.org/jeps/282) to bundle a slimmed-down JVM as part of your final app artifact.
