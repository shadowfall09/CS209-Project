First of all, be sure to check the documentation on constructing a `Mat` in `C++`. Since you have a 1D array and (I assume) you know the `rows` and `columns` you want to give your `Mat`, you should use [this constructor][1]:\r\n\r\n    cv::Mat::Mat (int rows, int cols, int type,\tvoid * data, size_t step = AUTO_STEP) \t\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a code example:\r\n\r\n    float data[10] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };\r\n    cv::Mat your_matrix = cv::Mat(1, 10, CV_32F, data);\r\n    \r\n    cout &lt;&lt; your_matrix.at&lt;float&gt;(0,2) &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n    cout &lt;&lt; your_matrix &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n\r\nIt will output:\r\n\r\n    3\r\n    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\r\n\r\nOf course you can change the datatype according to your needs (e.g. use `int` instead of `float`). You can ignore the `AUTO_STEP` parameter, but be sure to check the documentation on the usage if you want to use it. Also, if you want to change the structure of your `Mat` (e.g. split the array into multiple rows) you can achieve this by changing the `rows` and `cols` arguments in the constructor:\r\n\r\n\r\n    float data[10] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };\r\n    cv::Mat your_matrix = cv::Mat(2, 5, CV_32F, data);\r\n    \r\n    cout &lt;&lt; your_matrix.at&lt;float&gt;(1,2) &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n    cout &lt;&lt; your_matrix &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n\r\nIt will output:\r\n\r\n    8\r\n    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5; \r\n    6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\r\n\r\nYou have now split your `Mat` object into two rows of 5 columns, instead of 1 row of 10 columns.\r\n\r\n**In case of Java:**\r\nIf you want to do this in Java, you were already on the right track. However, you probably forgot to specify the rows, columns and channels/depth. Change the rows, cols and CvType according to whatever suits your data as before. You can do the following:\r\n\r\n    float data[] = new float[]{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\r\n    Mat mat = new Mat(1, 10, CvType.CV_32F);\r\n    mat.put(0, 0, data);\r\n\r\nBe sure to check the [Java documentation on Mat][2] as well!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d3/d63/classcv_1_1Mat.html#a51615ebf17a64c968df0bf49b4de6a3a\r\n  [2]: http://docs.opencv.org/java/3.1.0/org/opencv/core/Mat.html","title":"Initialize the values into Mat object in OpenCV","body":"<p>Your question is not entirely clear to me, but I'm going to assume you are trying to load a <code>float array</code> into a OpenCV <code>Mat</code> object in a single row.

The original script is included below and it works correctly. The upgraded script doesn&#39;t work: the application fails to start (more details below). I could use a second pair of eyes from somebody who has more experience with Gradle and/or SpringBoot. I have very limited experience with both.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe &quot;compile&quot; and &quot;testCompile&quot; dependency configuration keywords have been deprecated. So in order to make the script compatible with Gradle 7.x or newer, I&#39;ve had to replace both of them with alternative keywords. [According to the docs](https://docs.gradle.org/6.9.4/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:java_plugin_and_dependency_management), the new-style of declaring dependencies involves replacing `compile` with `implementation` and `testCompile` with `testImplementation`. \r\n\r\nHowever, simply replacing &quot;compile&quot; with &quot;implementation&quot; doesn&#39;t work. It turns out, including dependencies as &quot;compile&quot; results in a fat jar, but specifying them as &quot;implementation&quot; does not.\r\n\r\nSo I&#39;ve also updated the `jar` task, based on [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49278063/how-do-i-create-an-executable-fat-jar-with-gradle-with-implementation-dependenci), to make it generate a fat jar or all the dependencies. In the `jar` task, I&#39;ve added the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmanifest {\r\n   attributes &quot;Main-Class&quot;: &quot;com.namespace.ApplicationKt&quot;\r\n}\r\nfrom {\r\n   configurations.runtimeClasspath.collect { it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it) }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter making that change, running `./gradlew publish` does generate a fat jar, similar in size to the previous jar that was generated by &quot;compile&quot; and &quot;testCompile&quot;.\r\n\r\nBut attempting to run it using `java -jar build/libs/output.jar` still doesn&#39;t work. It throws this exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication - Application startup failed\r\norg.springframework.context.ApplicationContextException: Unable to start embedded container;

The original script is included below and it works correctly. The upgraded script doesn't work: the application fails to start (more details below). I could use a second pair of eyes from somebody who has more experience with Gradle and/or SpringBoot. I have very limited experience with both.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The &quot;compile&quot; and &quot;testCompile&quot; dependency configuration keywords have been deprecated. So in order to make the script compatible with Gradle 7.x or newer, I've had to replace both of them with alternative keywords. <a href=\"https://docs.gradle.org/6.9.4/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:java_plugin_and_dependency_management\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">According to the docs</a>, the new-style of declaring dependencies involves replacing <code>compile</code> with <code>implementation</code> and <code>testCompile</code> with <code>testImplementation</code>.</p>\n<p>However, simply replacing &quot;compile&quot; with &quot;implementation&quot; doesn't work. It turns out, including dependencies as &quot;compile&quot; results in a fat jar, but specifying them as &quot;implementation&quot; does not.</p>\n<p>So I've also updated the <code>jar</code> task, based on <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49278063/how-do-i-create-an-executable-fat-jar-with-gradle-with-implementation-dependenci\">this guide</a>, to make it generate a fat jar or all the dependencies. In the <code>jar</code> task, I've added the following:</p>\n<pre><code>manifest {\n   attributes &quot;Main-Class&quot;: &quot;com.namespace.ApplicationKt&quot;\n}\nfrom {\n   configurations.runtimeClasspath.collect { it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it) }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>After making that change, running <code>./gradlew publish</code> does generate a fat jar, similar in size to the previous jar that was generated by &quot;compile&quot; and &quot;testCompile&quot;.</p>\n<p>But attempting to run it using <code>java -jar build/libs/output.jar</code> still doesn't work. It throws this exception:</p>\n<pre><code>ERROR org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication - Application startup failed\norg.springframework.context.ApplicationContextException: Unable to start embedded container;

However, if you are caching a collection, then I'd argue to 1) keep the <code>List</code> of things related and 2) small.</p>\n<p>There are several ways to handle what you want to do in your case, but I present 1 way here.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WARNING: This approach is not necessarily the best way, and it depends on the use case, requirements and SLAs for your application.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See the example <a href=\"https://github.com/jxblum/stackoverflow-questions-answers/blob/cached-collection/spring-cache/src/test/java/io/stackoverflow/questions/spring/cache/CachingCollectionOfObjectsIntegrationTests.java#L75-L105\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">test</a> I wrote for this post.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":14331277,"reputation":71,"user_id":10351954,"display_name":"J.

All such methods are implicitly `abstract`, so you don&#39;t need to use the word `abstract`.\r\n* In old versions of Java, interfaces could not have default implementations, so *every* method was `abstract`. This is no longer the case, and interfaces can now have default implementations that get used in `implement`ing classes unless replaced.\r\n* In recent versions of Java, interfaces can declare `private` helper methods. These can help in implementing default implementations.\r\n* Interfaces can never have constructors or instance variables.\r\n* A class can `implement` several interfaces.\r\n\r\nAn `abstract class` is just a class that cannot be instantiated. Abstract classes are not required to  define any `abstract` methods, though you&#39;ll usually want to.\r\n\r\n* Abstract classes can declare methods with any visibility: `public`, `private`, `protected`, and package-private.\r\n* Abstract classes can implement methods or leave them `abstract`. Methods in an abstract class are *not* implicitly `abstract` and must be marked as such.\r\n* An abstract class can have constructors, which must be called by `extend`ing classes in their own constructor using `super`. An abstract class can have instance variables of any visibility, and these work just like instance variables in any parent class.\r\n* A class can only `extend` one class, either an `abstract` one or a concrete one. A class&#39; `abstract`ness does not change the number of superclasses it&#39;s allowed to have.\r\n\r\n`abstract class`es should be the exception and not the norm. You should use an abstract class if you need to maintain some internal state while also letting subclasses define your own behavior. A great example of this comes from the Java Swing GUI library: [`AbstractButton`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/AbstractButton.html). `AbstractButton` is the abstract parent of things that behave vaguely like buttons in a window, including buttons, toggle buttons, and items in a menu. Anyone can subclass `AbstractButton` and implement its members to define a button-like display. But `AbstractButton` also has to maintain a lot of internal state (much of it coming from `JComponent`) in order to communicate with the window and with the Swing API as a whole.\r\n\r\nIf you want to define the public interface for a collection of types, use an `interface`. If you want to provide default implementations for some of those methods and are using a version of Java released after 2014, use interfaces. If you need default implementations but are stuck in the 2000s, use an abstract class. Regardless of Java version, if you need private state such as instance variables or custom initialization like a constructor, use an abstract class.","title":"When to use abstraction and when an interface?","body":"<p>The general age-old principle is: Stick with interfaces until you're forced to write an abstract class.</p>\n<p>An <code>interface</code> in Java is a non-instantiable type which defines a public interface that other types can <em>choose</em> to conform to.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interfaces can declare public methods, which must be defined by their implementors. All such methods are implicitly <code>abstract</code>, so you don't need to use the word <code>abstract</code>.</li>\n<li>In old versions of Java, interfaces could not have default implementations, so <em>every</em> method was <code>abstract</code>. This is no longer the case, and interfaces can now have default implementations that get used in <code>implement</code>ing classes unless replaced.</li>\n<li>In recent versions of Java, interfaces can declare <code>private</code> helper methods. These can help in implementing default implementations.</li>\n<li>Interfaces can never have constructors or instance variables.</li>\n<li>A class can <code>implement</code> several interfaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An <code>abstract class</code> is just a class that cannot be instantiated. Abstract classes are not required to  define any <code>abstract</code> methods, though you'll usually want to.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstract classes can declare methods with any visibility: <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>protected</code>, and package-private.</li>\n<li>Abstract classes can implement methods or leave them <code>abstract</code>. Methods in an abstract class are <em>not</em> implicitly <code>abstract</code> and must be marked as such.</li>\n<li>An abstract class can have constructors, which must be called by <code>extend</code>ing classes in their own constructor using <code>super</code>. An abstract class can have instance variables of any visibility, and these work just like instance variables in any parent class.</li>\n<li>A class can only <code>extend</code> one class, either an <code>abstract</code> one or a concrete one. A class' <code>abstract</code>ness does not change the number of superclasses it's allowed to have.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>abstract class</code>es should be the exception and not the norm. You should use an abstract class if you need to maintain some internal state while also letting subclasses define your own behavior. A great example of this comes from the Java Swing GUI library: <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/AbstractButton.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>AbstractButton</code></a>. <code>AbstractButton</code> is the abstract parent of things that behave vaguely like buttons in a window, including buttons, toggle buttons, and items in a menu. Anyone can subclass <code>AbstractButton</code> and implement its members to define a button-like display. But <code>AbstractButton</code> also has to maintain a lot of internal state (much of it coming from <code>JComponent</code>) in order to communicate with the window and with the Swing API as a whole.</p>\n<p>If you want to define the public interface for a collection of types, use an <code>interface</code>. If you want to provide default implementations for some of those methods and are using a version of Java released after 2014, use interfaces. If you need default implementations but are stuck in the 2000s, use an abstract class. Regardless of Java version, if you need private state such as instance variables or custom initialization like a constructor, use an abstract class.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":23126814,"reputation":45,"user_id":17232487,"display_name":"Bambi2k21"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":125,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1699893098,"accepted_answer_id":77475110,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1699893766,"creation_date":1699886561,"question_id":77474701,"body_markdown":"I vaguely understand the difference between abstraction and interfaces, but what I can&#39;t understand at all, is when to use abstraction and when an interface.
