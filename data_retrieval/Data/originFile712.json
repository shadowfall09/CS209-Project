We realized that this didn't make sense for storing a list of ingredients in a recipe, so I'm in the process of refactoring it to be a list of a new type I created, <code>Ingredient</code>: <code>List&lt;Ingredient&gt; ingredients</code>. The ingredient form field is dynamically created by JS on the front end, and when submitted on a POST request, is transformed into an ArrayList of new Ingredients and then added into the Recipe model.</p>\n<p>Whenever it reaches the line where it saves it into the database, I get this error:</p>\n<p><code>Field 'ingredients' doesn't have a default value</code>, which tells me that the field is null. However, when I use the debug tools, it shows me that newRecipe.ingredients is not null, its actually an ArrayList created from the data on the front end.</p>\n<p>The Ingredient class looks like such:</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity\npublic class Ingredient extends AbstractEntity{\n\n    @ManyToOne(targetEntity = Recipe.class,\n            fetch = FetchType.LAZY,\n            cascade = {CascadeType.MERGE, CascadeType.REMOVE})\n    @NotNull(message = &quot;Please include ingredients&quot;)\n    private Recipe recipe;\n\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue\n    private int id;\n\n    private String ingredient;\n\n    public Ingredient(String ingredient) {\n        this.ingredient = ingredient;\n    }\n\n    public String getIngredient() {\n        return ingredient;\n    }\n\n    public void setIngredient(String ingredient) {\n        this.ingredient = ingredient;\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Recipe Class is here:</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity\npublic class Recipe extends AbstractEntity {\n\n   private String name;\n\n   @OneToMany(mappedBy = &quot;recipe&quot;)\n   @NotNull(message = &quot;Ingredients required&quot;)\n   private List&lt;Ingredient&gt; ingredients = new ArrayList&lt;Ingredient&gt;();\n\n   private String directions;\n\n   @OneToMany(mappedBy = &quot;recipe&quot;)\n   private List&lt;Instruction&gt; instructions = new ArrayList&lt;Instruction&gt;();\n\n   @NotNull(message = &quot;Category required&quot;)\n   private Category category;\n\n   private Tag tag;\n\n   private String img;\n\n   @OneToMany(mappedBy = &quot;recipe&quot;, cascade = {CascadeType.MERGE, CascadeType.REMOVE})\n   @NotNull(message = &quot;User is required&quot;)\n   private List&lt;UserRecipe&gt; users = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n\n   public Recipe() {\n   }\n\n   public String getName() {\n      return name;\n   }\n\n   public void setName(String name) {\n      this.name = name;\n   }\n\n\n   public Category getCategory() {\n      return category;\n   }\n\n   public void setCategory(Category category) {\n      this.category = category;\n   }\n\n   public List&lt;UserRecipe&gt; getUsers() {\n      return users;\n   }\n\n   public void setUsers(List&lt;UserRecipe&gt; users) {\n      this.users = users;\n   }\n\n   public String getImg() {\n      return img;\n   }\n\n   public void setImg(String img) {\n      this.img = img;\n   }\n\n\n   public List&lt;Ingredient&gt; getIngredients() {\n      return ingredients;\n   }\n\n   public void setIngredients(List&lt;Ingredient&gt; ingredients) {\n      this.ingredients = ingredients;\n   }\n\n   public String getDirections() {\n      return directions;\n   }\n\n   public void setDirections(String directions) {\n      this.directions = directions;\n   }\n\n   public Tag getTag() {\n      return tag;\n   }\n\n   public void setTag(Tag tag) {\n      this.tag = tag;\n   }\n\n   public List&lt;Instruction&gt; getInstructions() {\n      return instructions;\n   }\n\n   public void setInstructions(List&lt;Instruction&gt; instructions) {\n      this.instructions = instructions;\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>RecipeController is here:</p>\n<pre><code>@PostMapping(&quot;create&quot;)\n   public String createRecipe(HttpServletRequest request, @ModelAttribute Recipe newRecipe,\n                              @ModelAttribute @Valid String newCategory,\n                              Errors errors, Model model, RedirectAttributes redirectAttrs) {\n\n      if (errors.hasErrors()) {\n         model.addAttribute(&quot;title&quot;, &quot;Create Recipe&quot;);\n         return &quot;recipes/create&quot;;\n      }\n\n      String[] ingredients = request.getParameterValues(&quot;ingredient&quot;);\n\n      List&lt;Ingredient&gt; ingredientsList = new ArrayList&lt;Ingredient&gt;();\n\n      for (int i = 0; i &lt; ingredients.length; i++) {\n         Ingredient newIngredient = new Ingredient(ingredients[i]);\n         ingredientsList.add(newIngredient);\n      }\n      newRecipe.setIngredients(ingredientsList);\n      \n      // THIS PRINTS AN ARRAY OF THE NUMBER OF INGREDIENTS ADDED\n      System.out.println(ingredientsList.toString());\n\n      // HERE IS WHERE MY ERROR HAPPENS\n      Recipe recipe = recipeRepository.save(newRecipe);\n      redirectAttrs.addAttribute(&quot;recipeId&quot;, recipe.getId());\n\n      return &quot;redirect:/recipes/display&quot;;\n   }\n</code></pre>\n<p>My thought here is that I'm somehow not mapping the ingredients list correctly to the recipe, but I can't figure this one out and after 3 days of googling and troubleshooting here I am.

Order the rows in your query by timestamp to preserve your message order.  To get it to be high performance you'll need to do a good job with PreparedStatement objects and other aspects of heap management.</p>\n\n<p>(5) Unit test (4) by running it a few times while message-generating changes are happening to your data base.</p>\n\n<p>(6) set up this program to repeat operation (6) several times a minute, while using a single persistent JDBC connection.  Queries to a small or empty table aren't very expensive, so this won't smack down your table server. </p>\n\n<p>(7) system test this whole setup.</p>\n\n<p>(8) figure out how to start your Java program from your crontab or your startup script.</p>\n\n<p>When you get all this working you'll have a functioning messaging / notification system ready for systems integration.  More importantly, you'll know exactly what you want your Java message-originating software to do.  Once you're up and running, if the latency of your messages or the database overhead proves to be a big problem, then you can migrate your Java program into a stored procedure.</p>\n\n<p>Note also that there are message-origination bindings for PERL and other languages built into the Apache ActiveMQ package, so you have some choices about how you implement your message-originating agent.</p>\n\n<p>This approach happens to have two advantages:  you aren't critically dependent on postgreSQL's distinctive stored-procedure scheme, and you aren't putting code with external communications dependencies into your table server.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":445017,"reputation":1103,"user_id":837189,"display_name":"scott"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1674289503,"creation_date":1674260851,"answer_id":75190462,"question_id":1771350,"body_markdown":"Since the original question mentions JMS, consider using Apache ActiveMQ.

So, what I would do is in whatever class you're initializing the network action, I would follow this paradigm:</p>\n\n<pre><code>try {\n  performNetworkAction();\n} catch (NoConnectionFoundException e) {\n  // handle the situation here\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Your application shouldn't be able to determine when a connection was lost, just how to react when you attempt a network action and no connection is found.</p>\n\n<p>That being said - you still may disagree with me.  If that is the case then the frequency of polling allowed/recommended might be documented in the API for the service you're using.  Also, if the resource from the 3rd party is static, you should cache it as opposed to getting it over and over again.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":87656,"reputation":31128,"user_id":242940,"display_name":"Sripathi Krishnan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1312164646,"creation_date":1312164646,"answer_id":6893667,"question_id":6890662,"body_markdown":"I wanted to expand [@Dave&#39;s answer][1], and a comment would not suffice.\r\n\r\n 1.
