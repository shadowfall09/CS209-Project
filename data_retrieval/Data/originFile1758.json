Still confused","body":"<p>I am learning about Kafka, and I am curious as to how a Kafka client should exist in a Microservices architecture I want Kafka to keep a log of important information, and enable automatic reaction to those information appropriately.</p>\n<p>My question is how should Kafka exist with the backend as a microservice?</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Stand alone client.- The Kafka client (producer/consumer) exists alone. It exposes an API for the frontend to do HTTP requests (POST, PUT), sending data. The data is then converted into events, and produced to the Kafka cluster by the Kafka client.- The consumer also lives here, and will make reactive API calls to a separate backend when necessary.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A layer in the backend- When the frontend makes a HTTP request (POST, PUT) to the backend, the ‘REST controller’ in the backend looks at what data is sent, and if necessary, produces it to the Kafka cluster. - The consumer also lives here, and reacts to new events internally with other services in the backend.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Producer in the frontend, consumer in the backend.- Frontend (React.js, Vue.js, etc) has a Kafka client that produces event of important information that requires logging. Consumer Kafka client also exists in the backend and reacts to events internally with other services. Backend also exposes an API for non-kafka requests.\nMaybe a combination of this? Or are these all wrong?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Confluent has been quite helpful so far, but I think I am missing something important to piece all of it together.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","azure","maven","azure-web-app-service","github-actions"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":22613317,"reputation":1314,"user_id":16793150,"display_name":"SauravDas-MT"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1639560392,"creation_date":1639560392,"answer_id":70361192,"question_id":70198809,"body_markdown":"If you check this [Deploy Angular app to Azure App Service running Linux from GitHub](https://nicolgit.github.io/how-deploy-angular-app-to-azure-appservice-running-linux-from-github/), you will understand how to deploy an Angular single page application, from GitHub to Azure App Service.\r\n\r\nIn order to deploy to App Service using GitHub Actions we need a workflow file. **A workflow is defined by a YAML (.yml) file in the `/.github/workflows/` path in your repository**.

That node is represented by a Map object, where the keys are represented by those IDs (ID_1, ID_2, etc) and the value by <code>Detail_Struct</code> objects. To be able to map the data under the &quot;Basket&quot; node, you have to add a new property in your <code>Name_Struct</code> class called <code>basket</code> like this:</p>\n<pre><code>public class Name_Struct implements Serializable {\n   private String name;\n   private Map&lt;String, Object&gt; basket;\n\n   public String getName() {\n       return name;\n   }\n\n   public void setName(String name) {\n       this.name = name;\n   }\n\n   @PropertyName(&quot;Basket&quot;)\n   public Map&lt;String, Object&gt; getBasket() {\n       return basket;\n   }\n\n   public void setBasket(Map&lt;String, Object&gt; basket) {\n       this.basket = basket;\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now to pass the data to the second activity, you have to add iterate the Map and create a <code>List&lt;Detail_Struct&gt;</code> that can be added to the Intent so it can be read in the second activity.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":21845664,"reputation":3,"user_id":16138542,"display_name":"Jhank Tatar"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":98,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":70360917,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1639559103,"creation_date":1639515930,"question_id":70355534,"body_markdown":"I want to pass data RC_1 to RC_2.
