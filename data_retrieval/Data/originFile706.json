No data are in <code>company</code> or <code>person</code>.\nThe DiscriminatorColumn has the same value <code>roles</code> in both cases.</p>\n<p>Also if I add the <code>DiscriminatorColumn objectType</code> in json</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;a Test&quot;,\n    &quot;roles&quot;: [\n        {\n            &quot;objectType&quot;: &quot;Company&quot;,\n            &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Testcity&quot;,\n            &quot;comopanyname&quot;: &quot;test inc.&quot;\n        },\n        {\n            &quot;objectType&quot;: &quot;Person&quot;,\n            &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Disney&quot;,\n            &quot;fistname&quot;: &quot;Mickey&quot;,\n            &quot;lastname&quot;: &quot;Maus&quot;\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>does nothing.</p>\n<p>What can I do?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","android-studio","layout","keyboard"],"owner":{"account_id":19549846,"reputation":1,"user_id":14305750,"display_name":"Music Lyrics"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1674944772,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1674570779,"creation_date":1674569865,"question_id":75222813,"body_markdown":"Any design of the interface of my app upload when using the keyboard as shown in the image\r\n\r\nhttps://i.stack.imgur.com/KxrJs.jpg\r\n\r\nhttps://i.stack.imgur.com/wRQb1.jpg\r\n\r\nMake Bottom Layouts Stay Down When You Raise The Keyboard\r\n\r\n\r\n  ","title":"don&#39;t move layout up when android studio keyboard shown","body":"<p>Any design of the interface of my app upload when using the keyboard as shown in the image</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KxrJs.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://i.stack.imgur.com/KxrJs.jpg</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wRQb1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://i.stack.imgur.com/wRQb1.jpg</a></p>\n<p>Make Bottom Layouts Stay Down When You Raise The Keyboard</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","testing"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":23483000,"reputation":56,"user_id":17534884,"display_name":"Samir Zafar"},"score":0,"creation_date":1674574406,"post_id":75222893,"comment_id":132740363,"body_markdown":"Just wondering, how come you need a variable of type TestEntityManager for this test class?","body":"Just wondering, how come you need a variable of type TestEntityManager for this test class?"},{"owner":{"account_id":27444946,"reputation":1,"user_id":20938912,"display_name":"Yauheni Kuchko"},"score":0,"creation_date":1674646028,"post_id":75222893,"comment_id":132757525,"body_markdown":"From the repository testing guides.

Can somebody help me with a simple java sample?\nThanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","maven","jenkins"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":4165445,"reputation":51,"user_id":3414500,"display_name":"GmanG77"},"score":0,"creation_date":1674511387,"post_id":75215267,"comment_id":132725980,"body_markdown":"OK I have now figured out the JAVA_HOME path - but I now get &quot;\nqemu-aarch64: Could not open &#39;/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1&#39;: No such file or directory&quot;. when I run &quot;+ mvn --version&quot;","body":"OK I have now figured out the JAVA_HOME path - but I now get &quot; qemu-aarch64: Could not open &#39;/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1&#39;: No such file or directory&quot;. when I run &quot;+ mvn --version&quot;"},{"owner":{"account_id":4599455,"reputation":2892,"user_id":3730626,"display_name":"M B"},"score":0,"creation_date":1674542104,"post_id":75215267,"comment_id":132730266,"body_markdown":"If you have maven installed on your Jenkins host, try removing the `tools` section to see if the problem continues.","body":"If you have maven installed on your Jenkins host, try removing the <code>tools</code> section to see if the problem continues."}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":11629934,"reputation":1,"user_id":8518507,"display_name":"jinxx_"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1674567557,"creation_date":1674567557,"answer_id":75222298,"question_id":75215267,"body_markdown":"Which docker image this container made of? if it&#39;s official jeknins docker image - java comes installed already, and you do not need to install it.

That, or, a place that the user can explicitly configure in a preferences dialog or a settings file.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":26005788,"reputation":5,"user_id":19715509,"display_name":"Liudmila Zavyalova"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":75222271,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1674567408,"creation_date":1674562357,"question_id":75221308,"body_markdown":"I want to receive files and save them in a folder inside resources.

Spring controls this bean lifecycle by creating only one bean that is shared across the whole application (of course you can change this behavior, but I refer to a default one here). In this case any static field has no sense - Spring makes sure that there is only one instance of `UserService`. And you get the error you have described, because static fields initialization happens many processor-cycles before Spring containers starts up.

The only problem is that you won&#39;t be able to load these values from Spring&#39;s `application.properties` file, you will have to maintain them directly in the code (or you could implement some class that loads values for these constants from properties file, but this sounds so verbose to the problem you are trying to solve).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/8704858/2194470\r\n  [2]: http://www.baeldung.com/configuration-properties-in-spring-boot","title":"How to assign a value from application.properties to a static variable?","body":"<p>Think about your problem for a second.

Also relevant: [`@RequestBody`][3] javadocs, [`@ResponseBody`][4] javadocs\r\n\r\nUsage examples would be something like this:\r\n\r\nUsing a JavaScript-library like JQuery, you would post a JSON-Object like this:\r\n\r\n    { &quot;firstName&quot; : &quot;Elmer&quot;, &quot;lastName&quot; : &quot;Fudd&quot; }\r\n\r\nYour controller method would look like this:\r\n\r\n    // controller\r\n    @ResponseBody @RequestMapping(&quot;/description&quot;)\r\n    public Description getDescription(@RequestBody UserStats stats){\r\n        return new Description(stats.getFirstName() + &quot; &quot; + stats.getLastname() + &quot; hates wacky wabbits&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // domain / value objects\r\n    public class UserStats{\r\n        private String firstName;\r\n        private String lastName;\r\n        // + getters, setters\r\n    }\r\n    public class Description{\r\n        private String description;\r\n        // + getters, setters, constructor\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow if you have [Jackson][5] on your classpath (and have an [`&lt;mvc:annotation-driven&gt;`][6] setup), Spring would convert the incoming JSON to a UserStats object from the post body (because you added the `@RequestBody` annotation) and it would serialize the returned object to JSON (because you added the `@ResponseBody` annotation). So the Browser / Client would see this JSON result:\r\n\r\n    { &quot;description&quot; : &quot;Elmer Fudd hates wacky wabbits&quot; }\r\n\r\nSee this previous answer of mine for a complete working example: https://stackoverflow.com/a/5908632/342852\r\n\r\nNote: RequestBody / ResponseBody is of course not limited to JSON, both can handle multiple formats, including plain text and XML, but JSON is probably the most used format.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Update\r\nEver since Spring 4.x, you usually won&#39;t use `@ResponseBody` on method level, but rather `@RestController` on class level, with the same effect.\r\n\r\nHere is a quote from the official [Spring MVC documentation][7]:\r\n\r\n&gt; `@RestController` is a [composed annotation][8] that is itself *meta-annotated*\r\n&gt; with `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody` to indicate a controller whose\r\n&gt; every method inherits the type-level `@ResponseBody` annotation and,\r\n&gt; therefore, writes directly to the response body versus view resolution\r\n&gt; and rendering with an HTML template.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-ann-requestbody\r\n  [2]: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-ann-responsebody\r\n  [3]: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/index.html?org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestBody.html\r\n  [4]: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/index.html?org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/ResponseBody.html\r\n  [5]: http://jackson.codehaus.org/\r\n  [6]: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-config-enable\r\n  [7]: https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-ann-controller\r\n  [8]: https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-meta-annotations","title":"@RequestBody and @ResponseBody annotations in Spring","body":"<p>There is a whole Section in the docs called <a href=\"http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-ann-requestbody\" rel=\"noreferrer\">16.3.3.4 Mapping the request body with the @RequestBody annotation</a>.

So the Browser / Client would see this JSON result:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{ \"description\" : \"Elmer Fudd hates wacky wabbits\" }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>See this previous answer of mine for a complete working example: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/5908632/342852\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/5908632/342852</a></p>\n\n<p>Note: RequestBody / ResponseBody is of course not limited to JSON, both can handle multiple formats, including plain text and XML, but JSON is probably the most used format.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Update</h2>\n\n<p>Ever since Spring 4.x, you usually won't use <code>@ResponseBody</code> on method level, but rather <code>@RestController</code> on class level, with the same effect.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a quote from the official <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-ann-controller\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Spring MVC documentation</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>@RestController</code> is a <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-meta-annotations\" rel=\"noreferrer\">composed annotation</a> that is itself <em>meta-annotated</em>\n  with <code>@Controller</code> and <code>@ResponseBody</code> to indicate a controller whose\n  every method inherits the type-level <code>@ResponseBody</code> annotation and,\n  therefore, writes directly to the response body versus view resolution\n  and rendering with an HTML template.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":5752727,"reputation":1642,"user_id":4541832,"display_name":"Maciej Lach"},"score":0,"creation_date":1444044900,"post_id":32947324,"comment_id":53719969,"body_markdown":"Please correct formatting of the answer and code sample.","body":"Please correct formatting of the answer and code sample."},{"owner":{"account_id":2483509,"reputation":1261,"user_id":2162470,"display_name":"Leonid Glanz"},"score":0,"creation_date":1444045622,"post_id":32947324,"comment_id":53720378,"body_markdown":"Please describe how this code helps the questioner.

This broke the pojocity of the component.</p>\n\n<p>So instead of wrinting a \"<code>BundleActivator</code>\" (OSGI-specifc API in your component: BAD), you write a plain POJO object:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class PollingComponent {\n    private static final int DEFAULT_PERIOD = 2000;\n    private PollingThread thread ;\n    protected void activate ( Map&lt;String , Object&gt; config ) {\n        System.out.println( \" Polling Component Activated \" );\n        Integer period = (Integer)config.get( \" period \" );\n        thread = new PollingThread(\n            period!=null ? period : DEFAULT_PERIOD);\n        thread.start();\n    }\n    protected void deactivate() {\n        System.out.println( \" Polling Component Deactivated \" );\n        thread.interrupt();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You will the simply <em>declare</em> your reference to other services:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;reference name=\"LOG\"\n    interface=\"org.osgi.service.log.LogService \"\n    bind=\"setLog\" unbind=\"unsetLog\"\n    cardinality=\"0..1\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And you can publis your component as a service itself:<br>\nThis is done with the <code>&lt;service&gt;</code> element in our XML descriptor.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;service&gt;\n    &lt;provide interface=\"net ...

Obviously, we can&#39;t be more specific unless you explain the scenario. \r\n\r\nThere are various factors to take into account.  For example:\r\n\r\n  - `Thread` + `Runnable` doesn&#39;t have a natural way to wait for / return a result.  (But it is not hard to implement.)\r\n  - Repeatedly creating bare `Thread` objects is inefficient because thread creation is expensive.  Thread pooling is better but you shouldn&#39;t implement a thread pool yourself.\r\n  - Solutions that use an `ExecutorService` take care of thread pooling and allow you to use `Callable` and return a `Future`.  But for a once-off async computation this might be over-kill.\r\n  - Solutions that involve `ComputableFuture` allow you to compose and combine asynchronous tasks.

If you were using `CompletableFuture` because you thought that `anyOf` was the solution, then you didn&#39;t need to do that.  Calling `ExecutorService.submit(Callable)` will give you a `Future` ...\r\n\r\nIt will be more complicated if you need to deal with exceptions thrown by the tasks and/or timeouts.  In the former case, you need to catch `ExecutionException` and the extract its `cause` exception to get the exception thrown by the task.\r\n\r\nThere is also the caveat that the second computation may ignore the interrupt and continue on regardless.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        ","title":"Thread vs Runnable vs CompletableFuture in Java multi threading","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>So, should I stick to <code>CompletableFuture</code> or use all of them based on the scenario?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Use the one that is most appropriate to the scenario.

So the solution is something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Integer i1 = future1.get();\nif (i1 == null) {\n    return future2.get();\n} else {\n    future2.cancel(true);\n    return i1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the above works with plain <code>Future</code> as well as CompletableFuture.  If you were using <code>CompletableFuture</code> because you thought that <code>anyOf</code> was the solution, then you didn't need to do that.  Calling <code>ExecutorService.submit(Callable)</code> will give you a <code>Future</code> ...</p>\n<p>It will be more complicated if you need to deal with exceptions thrown by the tasks and/or timeouts.  In the former case, you need to catch <code>ExecutionException</code> and the extract its <code>cause</code> exception to get the exception thrown by the task.</p>\n<p>There is also the caveat that the second computation may ignore the interrupt and continue on regardless.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":444292,"reputation":1,"user_id":836018,"accept_rate":57,"display_name":"Jack"},"score":0,"creation_date":1673039946,"post_id":75029179,"comment_id":132416051,"body_markdown":"Veeerry veeery good, actually perfect explanation.

So to use the first non‑null result we need to chain another operation which will resort to `thenCombine` if the first result is `null`.

You could also just use `i -&gt; i` to denote an identity function; that’s [mostly a stylistic choice].\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote that most complications stem from the design that tries to avoid blocking threads by always chaining a dependent operation to be executed when the previous stage has been completed. The examples above follow this principle as the final `join()` call is only for demonstration purposes; you can easily remove it and return the future, if the caller expects a future rather than being blocked.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to perform the final blocking `join()` anyway, because you need the result value immediately, you can also use\r\n\r\n```java\r\nInteger result = future1.applyToEither(future2, Function.identity()).join();\r\nif(result == null) {\r\n    Integer a = future1.join(), b = future2.join();\r\n    result = a != null? a: b;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich might be easier to read and debug.

But it does not stop the evaluation of the unnecessary future. Stopping an already ongoing evaluation is not supported by `CompletableFuture` at all. You can call [`cancel(…)`] on it, but this will will only [set the completion state (result) of the future to “exceptionally completed with a `CancellationException`”][1]\r\n\r\nSo whether you call `cancel` or not, the already ongoing evaluation will continue in the background and only its final result will be ignored.\r\n\r\nThis might be acceptable for some operations.

Equality corresponds to object identity.  This is of course the default provided by `Object.equals()`, and it can serve perfectly well for entities.  OR\r\n\r\n 2. Equality corresponds to persistent identity.  That is, entities are equal if and only if they have the same entity type and primary key. OR\r\n\r\n 3. Equality corresponds to (only) value equality.

Equality corresponds to persistent identity AND value equality.  Again, there are variations around how the value equality part applies to mapped relationships.\r\n\r\n## General advice\r\nIn general, you would do well to follow a fule rules of thumb:\r\n\r\n 1. As with most other classes, especially mutable ones, **default to just inheriting `Object.equals()` and `Object.hashCode()`**.  Have a specific purpose and plan before you do otherwise, and remember that you get only one choice for this.  And that it is impactful.\r\n\r\n 2. If you do override `equals()` (and therefore `hashCode()` as well) then do it in a consistent way across all your entities.\r\n\r\n 3. Think carefully before you go with an option involving value equality.  This is usually a poor choice for mutable classes in general, and entities are no exception.\r\n\r\n## Specific Questions\r\n\r\n&gt; **1.** By considering object states in Hibernate, I think it is good practice not using id field in equals and hashCode methods, right?\r\n\r\nI think using the ID is fine.  It&#39;s simply a question of what you want equality to represent for your entities.  You absolutely can have distinct entity objects with the same type and ID, and you might want to be able to detect that with `equals()`.  The other persistent fields might or might not factor into that.\r\n\r\nIn particular, an `equals()` method based solely on entity ID might make sense for entities that appear on the &quot;many&quot; side of a one-to-many relationship when that is mapped to a `Set`.\r\n\r\n&gt; **2.** When there is a unique field in a class, is it enough to use only one of the unique fields in equals and hashCode methods (except\r\n&gt; from id field)?\r\n\r\nI see no good reason to consider only a proper subset of unique fields, except that subset consisting only of the entity ID. Or if all the fields are unique then the one consisting of all the fields *except* the ID.  The logic that suggests that you might be able to consider other proper subsets revolves around the persistent identity of the entity, which is completely and best represented by its ID.\r\n\r\n&gt; **3.** Should I add all the fields except from id field when there is not any unique field except from id field in a class? Or should I only\r\n&gt; add some numeric field instead of adding text fields?\r\n\r\nIf your sense of equality is to be based on entity value then I don&#39;t see how it makes much sense to omit any persistent fields except, possibly, the ID.  Do not arbitrarily omit the ID -- it may very well be something you want to include.  Again, it depends on what `equals()` is intended to mean for your entities.","title":"equals and hashCode with many fields in Java?","body":"<p>JPA and Hibernate don't specify or rely on any particular semantics for entities' <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code> methods, so you can do what you want.</p>\n<h2>Good alternatives</h2>\n<p>With that said, there is a handful of alternatives for equality that make much more sense to me than any others:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Equality corresponds to object identity.

After all, given that hibernate doesn&#39;t require you to do anything particular, you can do whatever you want, which leads to the obvious question: ... okay, so what should I do, then?\r\n\r\nThat question boils down to (using `Person` as an arbitrary example of a model class + associated table; furthermore, lets say the `person` table has a single unique ID that is generated (A random UUID or auto-sequenced integer value).\r\n\r\n_What does an instance of `Person` represent_?\r\n\r\nThere are in broad strokes 2 answers:\r\n\r\n* It represents a person. A row in the `person` table _also_ represents a person; these 2 things aren&#39;t related.\r\n* It represents _a row in the `person` table_.\r\n* It represents a state in my application, nothing more.\r\n\r\nEven though these things sound quite similar, they result in opposite meanings as to equality.\r\n\r\nWhich choice is correct? That&#39;s up to you.\r\n\r\nWhen reading on, remember:\r\n\r\nAny `Person` instance which isn&#39;t &quot;saved&quot; yet, would have a `null` value for `id`, because upon insertion, hibernate will ask the DB to generate a value for it or generates one itself and only then fills it in.\r\n\r\n## An instance represents a row\r\n\r\n* Equality under the second model (an instance of `Person` represents a row in the table) should look __only__ at the `id` column, because that defines row uniqueness; any 2 representations of a row in the `person` table are guaranteed to be referring to the same row (hence, _equal_) if and only if the `id` is equal. That is a necessary and sufficient condition: If they are equal the 2 objects are necessarily referring to the same row, and if they aren&#39;t equal, then they are necessarily referring to different rows.\r\n* Notably, if `id` is still `null`, then __they cannot be equal__, not even to themselves: More generally the question: &quot;Is this object-representing-a-row equal to this other object-representing-a-row&quot; is a meaningless question if these objects are representing rows-to-be (unsaved rows). If you invoke `save()` on each object, you end up with 2 rows. Optimally such an object should be considered in a state such that attempting to invoke equals on it is a failure, but the spec of `equals` states that they can&#39;t throw, therefore, `false` is the best answer. This would mean you want:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Person {\r\n  // fields\r\n  @Override public boolean equals(Object other) {\r\n    if (other == this) return true;\r\n    if (other == null || other.getClass() != Person.class) return false;\r\n    UUID otherId = ((Person) other).id;\r\n    return id == null ? false : id.equals(otherId);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis defines your equals method as &#39;ends up representing the same row&#39;. This holds _even if_ you change meaningful state:\r\n\r\n* Change the name and save the object? It&#39;s... still the same row, and this equality implementation reflects this.\r\n* Call save() on each in the comparison when they were unsaved? Then you get 2 rows - and this equality implementation reflects this before _and_ after attempting to save it. \r\n* If invoking on self (`a.equals(a)`) this returns `true` as the equality spec demands; it also works out in the &#39;modelling a row&#39; view: If you invoke save() on the same object twice, it&#39;s still just one row.\r\n\r\n## An instance represents a person\r\n\r\nThe nature of what a person is is entirely unrelated to the autosequence/autogen ID it gets; the fact that we&#39;re using hibernate is an implementation detail that should play no part at all in considering equality; after all, this object represents the notion of a person, and that notion exists entirely independent of the database. The database is one thing that is modelling persons; instances of this class are another.\r\n\r\nIn this model you should do the exact opposite: Find something that uniquely identifies a person itself, and compare against that. After all, if you have 2 rows in a database that both contain the same social security number, then you have only 1 person.. and you just happen to have 2 rows that are both referring to the same person. Given that we chose our instance to imply that it represents __a person__, then an instance loaded from row A, and an instance loaded from row B, ought to be considered as equal - after all, they are representing the same individual.\r\n\r\nIn this case, you write an equals method that considers all relevant fields __except__ the autoseq/autogen ID field! If there is a separate unique id such as social security number, use that. If there isn&#39;t, essentially it boils down to an equals method that compares all fields, _except_ ID. Because that&#39;s the one field that definitely has zero bearing on what defines a person.\r\n\r\n## An instance defines a state in your application\r\n\r\nThis is almost a cop-out, and in general means equality is irrelevant / not applicable. It&#39;s like asking how to implement an equals method to an `InputStream` implementation - mostly, you.. don&#39;t.\r\n\r\nHere, the default behaviour (`Object`&#39;s own impls) are what you want, and therefore, you don&#39;t implement either `hashCode` or `equals`. Any instance of Person is equal to itself (as in, `a.equals(a)`, same reference), and not equal to any other, even if the other has identical values for each and every field, even the id field isn&#39;t `null` (represents the same row).\r\n\r\nSuch an object cannot meaningfully be used as a value object. For example, it would be pointless to stuff such things in a hashmap (at best, you can stuff them in an `IdentityHashMap`, as those semantics would apply. Only way to do any lookups is to have a ref that was `.put()` into it before and call `.get()` with that).\r\n\r\nWhich one is right? Up to you. But document it clearly, because in my experience, lots of hibernate users are absolutely convinced either the first or second model is the one, and only, right answer, and consider the other answer utterly bonkers. This is problematic - they&#39;d be writing their code assuming __all__ hibernate model classes work precisely as they want, and would therefore not even be thinking of checking docs/impl to know how it actually works.\r\n\r\nFor what its worth, objects are objects and database rows do not neatly map to the notion of an object.

In [Firebase Realtime database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/android/read-and-write) you could also use an `array`, but this is an anti-pattern.

The document `of` has three subcollections: `AudioSources` (recordings of the word in American and British accents), `FunFacts`, and `Translations`.

This was a lot of code, and with a deep data structure and/or large arrays I was downloading tons of data that I didn&#39;t need, and slowing my app running `forEach` loops on large arrays. Firestore puts the iterators in the database, on their end, so that I can request a single element and it sends me just that element, saving me bandwidth and making my app run faster.
