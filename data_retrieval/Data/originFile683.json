I would liked to have seen an unsigned byte as well, but I guess doubling the memory cost and instead use char is a viable option.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Edit</h2>\n\n<p>With JDK8 there are new APIs for <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Long.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>Long</code></a> and <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>Integer</code></a> which provide helper methods when treating <code>long</code> and <code>int</code> values as unsigned values.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>compareUnsigned</code></li>\n<li><code>divideUnsigned</code></li>\n<li><code>parseUnsignedInt</code></li>\n<li><code>parseUnsignedLong</code></li>\n<li><code>remainderUnsigned</code></li>\n<li><code>toUnsignedLong</code></li>\n<li><code>toUnsignedString</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/wiki\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Guava</a> provides a number of helper methods to do similar things for at the integer types which helps close the gap left by the lack of native support for <code>unsigned</code> integers.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":47283,"reputation":703927,"user_id":139985,"accept_rate":69,"display_name":"Stephen C"},"score":36,"creation_date":1341051413,"post_id":9650388,"comment_id":14823617,"body_markdown":"Just for kicks, Google the phrase &quot;self rotating loop&quot;.  **Clearly**, Denis Co is the only person in the world worthy of calling himself / herself a programmer :-)","body":"Just for kicks, Google the phrase &quot;self rotating loop&quot;.  <b>Clearly</b>, Denis Co is the only person in the world worthy of calling himself / herself a programmer :-)"},{"owner":{"account_id":446566,"reputation":18084,"user_id":839689,"accept_rate":71,"display_name":"Nayuki"},"score":10,"creation_date":1461368818,"post_id":9650388,"comment_id":61183691,"body_markdown":"This answer is so bad that it&#39;s funny","body":"This answer is so bad that it&#39;s funny"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1314302,"reputation":73,"user_id":1261572,"display_name":"Denis Co"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":18,"up_vote_count":9,"is_accepted":false,"score":-9,"last_activity_date":1331415476,"creation_date":1331415476,"answer_id":9650388,"question_id":430346,"body_markdown":"The reason IMHO is because they are/were too lazy to implement/correct that mistake. \r\nSuggesting that C/C++ programmers does not understand unsigned, structure, union, bit flag...

And, in relation to this thread topic, the difficulty of maintaining Unsigned semantics in the Signed world of Java.\r\n\r\nI would guess if one were to get a Dennis Ritchie alter ego to advise Gosling&#39;s design team it would have suggested giving Signed&#39;s a &quot;zero at infinity&quot;, so that all address offset requests would first add their ALGEBRAIC RING SIZE to obviate negative values.\r\n\r\nThat way, any offset thrown at the array can never generate a SEGFAULT.

If you need a general purpose implementation of the `Map` interface, use `HashMap` instead.\r\n\r\nIn case when you need to initialize a general purpose `Map` with a few entries, you can use one of the overloaded versions of [`Map.of()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html#of(K,V)) method which is available starting with Java 9. It allows providing up to `10` *key-value pairs*, if you need more you can use [`Map.ofEntries()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html#ofEntries(java.util.Map.Entry...)), which takes a varargs of map entries. You can create a map entry using another Java 9 method [`Map.entry()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html#entry(K,V)).\r\n\r\n*Example:*\r\n```\r\npublic static final Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; numbers = \r\n    Map.of(&quot;one&quot;, 1, &quot;two&quot;, 2, &quot;three&quot;, 3);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note** these maps are \r\n\r\n**1.** *Immutable*, therefore it would be the right choice only if the data never change (or might change rarely, i.e. in case of very frequent reads and infrequent writes, and every write would require re-initializing the map).\r\n\r\n**2** So-called *unmodifiable maps* like `MapN` (which is an internal implementation used by `Map.ofEntries()` intended to store an arbitrary number of key-value pairs) are optimized in terms of Memory consumption, their underlying array occupies exactly as match space as match there are key-value pairs and no more, and retrieving a value from an *unmodifiable map* using `get()` might even perform slightly better (*see the quote below*) in comparison to a `HashMap`.\r\n\r\nFor more information you can refer to official documentation - [*Creating Immutable Lists, Sets, and Maps*][useCases]:\r\n\r\n&gt; **Use Cases**\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The common use case for the immutable methods is a collection that is\r\n&gt; initialized from known values, and that never changes. Also consider\r\n&gt; using these methods if your data changes infrequently.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; For optimal performance, the immutable collections store a data set\r\n&gt; that never changes. However, you may be able to take advantage of the\r\n&gt; performance and space-saving benefits even if your data is subject to\r\n&gt; change. **These collections may provide better performance than the\r\n&gt; mutable collections**, even if your data changes occasionally.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; If you have a large number of values, you may consider storing them in\r\n&gt; a HashMap. If you are constantly adding and removing entries, then\r\n&gt; this is a good choice. But, if you have a set of values that never\r\n&gt; change, or rarely change, and you read from that set a lot, then the\r\n&gt; immutable Map is a more efficient choice. If the data set is read\r\n&gt; frequently, and the values change only rarely, then you may find that\r\n&gt; the overall speed is faster, even when you include the performance\r\n&gt; impact of destroying and rebuilding an immutable Map when a value\r\n&gt; changes.\r\n\r\nAlso note that depending on the type of keys and the actual data (specifically on the number of collisions), an unmodifiable map might perform worse than a `HashMap` because contrary to `HashMap` unmodifiable map is incapable to store and reuse hashes of the keys and hence might perform more comparisons of keys using `equals` method. And in case of large number of collisions, unmodifiable map has no means to mitigate performance degradation, unlike `HashMap` which since would try to arrange nodes into a tree when the number of nodes in a bucket exceeds certain threshold.\r\n\r\nSpiking of other alternatives doubly-brace initialization, which creates an instance of anonymous inner class, is indisputably a discouraged practice.\r\n\r\nStatic and instance initializer blocks have no downsides from the technical point of view, they allow you to keep the variables `final` if you need that.

Also consider\nusing these methods if your data changes infrequently.</p>\n<p>For optimal performance, the immutable collections store a data set\nthat never changes. However, you may be able to take advantage of the\nperformance and space-saving benefits even if your data is subject to\nchange. <strong>These collections may provide better performance than the\nmutable collections</strong>, even if your data changes occasionally.</p>\n<p>If you have a large number of values, you may consider storing them in\na HashMap. If you are constantly adding and removing entries, then\nthis is a good choice. But, if you have a set of values that never\nchange, or rarely change, and you read from that set a lot, then the\nimmutable Map is a more efficient choice. If the data set is read\nfrequently, and the values change only rarely, then you may find that\nthe overall speed is faster, even when you include the performance\nimpact of destroying and rebuilding an immutable Map when a value\nchanges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also note that depending on the type of keys and the actual data (specifically on the number of collisions), an unmodifiable map might perform worse than a <code>HashMap</code> because contrary to <code>HashMap</code> unmodifiable map is incapable to store and reuse hashes of the keys and hence might perform more comparisons of keys using <code>equals</code> method. And in case of large number of collisions, unmodifiable map has no means to mitigate performance degradation, unlike <code>HashMap</code> which since would try to arrange nodes into a tree when the number of nodes in a bucket exceeds certain threshold.</p>\n<p>Spiking of other alternatives doubly-brace initialization, which creates an instance of anonymous inner class, is indisputably a discouraged practice.</p>\n<p>Static and instance initializer blocks have no downsides from the technical point of view, they allow you to keep the variables <code>final</code> if you need that. But some might argue that from the perspective of clean coding, initializer blocks are not very great.</p>\n<p>Another possibility you might consider is to initialize a map inline using Stream API (<em>for instance, when map-data can be expressed as a sequence that is easy to generate</em>).</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1992310,"reputation":11172,"user_id":1786065,"accept_rate":91,"display_name":"Rogue"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"is_accepted":true,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1659701072,"creation_date":1659464485,"answer_id":73212061,"question_id":73211801,"body_markdown":"For Java 9 and beyond, you can make use of [`Map#of`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#of--), as well as [`Map#ofEntries`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#ofEntries-java.util.Map.Entry...-) with [`Map#entry`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#entry-K-V-):\r\n\r\n    Map&lt;String, String&gt; example = Map.ofEntries(\r\n        Map.entry(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;one&quot;),\r\n        Map.entry(&quot;2&quot;, &quot;two&quot;),\r\n        Map.entry(&quot;3&quot;, &quot;three&quot;),\r\n        //...\r\n    );\r\n\r\nFor shorter literals (10 or less entries), you can use `Map#of` directly (albeit with a slightly confusing syntax of `Key1, Value1, Key2, Value2, ...`):\r\n\r\n    Map&lt;String, String&gt; example = Map.of(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;two&quot;);\r\n\r\nPrior to Java 9, this would typically only be needed for initializing constant `Map` objects, for which a `static` initializer block is also useful:\r\n\r\n    private static final Map&lt;String, String&gt; MY_CONSTANT;\r\n\r\n    static {\r\n        Map&lt;String, String&gt; setup = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n        setup.put(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;one&quot;);\r\n        setup.put(&quot;2&quot;, &quot;two&quot;);\r\n        setup.put(&quot;3&quot;, &quot;three&quot;);\r\n        MY_CONSTANT = Collections.unmodifiableMap(setup);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis will allow you to create a constant `Map` while allowing you to modify the map before it is set.\r\n\r\nAs pointed out by [@Pshemo](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1393766/pshemo), there are [numerous reasons to avoid double-brace initialization](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1958636/what-is-double-brace-initialization-in-java/27521360#27521360), however the notable exception to the &quot;rule&quot; is typically in constants much like the above example (as numerous anonymous classes would not be made).

Query the Provider Configuration or Authorization Server Metadata endpoint for the `jwks_url` property\r\n&gt; 2. Query the `jwks_url` endpoint for supported algorithms\r\n&gt; 3. Configure the validation strategy to query `jwks_url` for valid public keys of the algorithms found\r\n&gt; 4. Configure the validation strategy to validate each JWTs `iss` claim against `idp.example.com`.\r\n\r\nAn important note from the docs which answers one of your questions is:\r\n\r\n&gt; If the authorization server is down when Resource Server queries it\r\n&gt; (given appropriate timeouts), then startup will fail.\r\n\r\nDuring the runtime, any request containing an `Authorization: Bearer` header is processed as follows:\r\n\r\n&gt; 1. Validate its signature against a public key obtained from the `jwks_url` endpoint during startup and matched against the JWT\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 2. Validate the JWT’s `exp` and `nbf` timestamps and the JWT’s `iss` claim, and\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 3. Map each scope to an authority with the prefix `SCOPE_`.\r\n\r\nThere is no communication between Resource Server and Authorization Server during this process, so it doesn&#39;t have to be up after startup.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe behavior you expected, in the beginning, is actually related to Opaque Token Authentication.

What Jon Skeet manages easily could give you a headache.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":8537,"reputation":40691,"user_id":15459,"accept_rate":70,"display_name":"PhiLho"},"score":3,"creation_date":1449850857,"post_id":15803895,"comment_id":56199878,"body_markdown":"Seems removed, probably in favor of `Enums.getIfPresent(Country.class, countryInput).or(Country.DEFAULT);`, which is nice.

There are two types of IPs; `32 Bit` and `128 Bit`.\r\n\r\n**32 Bit** [Source](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Ipv4_address.svg)\r\n\r\n[![32 Bit][2]][2]\r\n\r\n - The `32 bit IP` is split into 4 groups of numbers between `0` and `255`. These groups are seperated via a `.`\r\n - A single group, as shown above, is 8 bits of data. This is the reason the numbers in a group are limited between `0` and `255`.\r\n - For a `32 bit IP` to be formatted correctly it should be `int.int.int.int`. Even if the int is a `0` it must be shown in the IP address. This is different to a `128 bit IP` which may omit `0`s. For example `::5:` which is the same as `0:0:5:0:0:0:0:0`.\r\n\r\n**128 Bit** [Source](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Ipv6_address_leading_zeros.svg)\r\n\r\n[![128 Bit][3]][3]\r\n\r\n - The `128 bit IP` is split into 8 groups of numbers between `0` and `FFFF` (which is equivalent to `65535`). Unlike a `32 bit IPs` group, these groups are separated buy a `:`.\r\n - A single group, as show above, is 16 bits of data. This is the reason the numbers in the groups are limited between `0` and `FFFF`.\r\n - To format a `128 bit IP` properly there are several rules you have to follow. `0`s may be omitted from groups and if the remaining groups all are `0` then the groups may also be omitted. The groups have to be separated by a `:`. If you are omitting groups the last group which isn&#39;t a `0` has to be followed by a `:`. These rules leave us with a format `int:int:int:int:int:int:int:int`. An example of `0`s and groups being omitted would be `58f:::fff:2:`. This is the same as `58f:0:0:fff:2:0:0:0`.\r\n\r\n**Sorting**\r\n\r\nOnce the IPs have been sorted into their respective groups they can be sorted. To sort an IP you need to use a method called weighting. This is because simply adding or multiplying different groups together wouldn&#39;t work. For example take the these two IPs; `192.5.48.198` and `198.48.5.192`. If you add or multiply the values of the groups together you get the same answer. So there is no way to accurately compare them using addition and multiplication. If you use weighting you get something like this.\r\n\r\n**32 Bit Weighting**\r\n\r\n    Value of IP = (Group one value * 256^4) + (Group two value * 256^3) +\r\n                  (Group three value * 256^2) + (Group four value * 256)\r\n\r\n**128 Bit Weighting**\r\n\r\n    Value of IP = (Group one value * 65536^8) + (Group two value * 65536^7) +\r\n                  (Group three value * 65536^6) + (Group four value * 65536^5) +\r\n                  (Group five value * 65536^4) + (Group six value * 65536^3) +\r\n                  (Group seven value * 65536^2) + (Group eight value * 65536)\r\n\r\n**The Code in Java**\r\n\r\nAs long as the IP is formatted reasonably correctly this code will separate the two kinds of IP and then sort them.\r\n\r\n\timport java.util.*;\r\n\timport java.math.*;

There are two types of IPs; <code>32 Bit</code> and <code>128 Bit</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>32 Bit</strong> <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Ipv4_address.svg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TDeU3.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TDeU3.png\" alt=\"32 Bit\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>32 bit IP</code> is split into 4 groups of numbers between <code>0</code> and <code>255</code>. These groups are seperated via a <code>.</code></li>\n<li>A single group, as shown above, is 8 bits of data. This is the reason the numbers in a group are limited between <code>0</code> and <code>255</code>.</li>\n<li>For a <code>32 bit IP</code> to be formatted correctly it should be <code>int.int.int.int</code>. Even if the int is a <code>0</code> it must be shown in the IP address. This is different to a <code>128 bit IP</code> which may omit <code>0</code>s. For example <code>::5:</code> which is the same as <code>0:0:5:0:0:0:0:0</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>128 Bit</strong> <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Ipv6_address_leading_zeros.svg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/R8RUt.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/R8RUt.png\" alt=\"128 Bit\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>128 bit IP</code> is split into 8 groups of numbers between <code>0</code> and <code>FFFF</code> (which is equivalent to <code>65535</code>). Unlike a <code>32 bit IPs</code> group, these groups are separated buy a <code>:</code>.</li>\n<li>A single group, as show above, is 16 bits of data. This is the reason the numbers in the groups are limited between <code>0</code> and <code>FFFF</code>.</li>\n<li>To format a <code>128 bit IP</code> properly there are several rules you have to follow. <code>0</code>s may be omitted from groups and if the remaining groups all are <code>0</code> then the groups may also be omitted. The groups have to be separated by a <code>:</code>. If you are omitting groups the last group which isn't a <code>0</code> has to be followed by a <code>:</code>. These rules leave us with a format <code>int:int:int:int:int:int:int:int</code>. An example of <code>0</code>s and groups being omitted would be <code>58f:::fff:2:</code>. This is the same as <code>58f:0:0:fff:2:0:0:0</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sorting</strong></p>\n<p>Once the IPs have been sorted into their respective groups they can be sorted. To sort an IP you need to use a method called weighting. This is because simply adding or multiplying different groups together wouldn't work. For example take the these two IPs; <code>192.5.48.198</code> and <code>198.48.5.192</code>. If you add or multiply the values of the groups together you get the same answer. So there is no way to accurately compare them using addition and multiplication. If you use weighting you get something like this.</p>\n<p><strong>32 Bit Weighting</strong></p>\n<pre><code>Value of IP = (Group one value * 256^4) + (Group two value * 256^3) +\n              (Group three value * 256^2) + (Group four value * 256)\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>128 Bit Weighting</strong></p>\n<pre><code>Value of IP = (Group one value * 65536^8) + (Group two value * 65536^7) +\n              (Group three value * 65536^6) + (Group four value * 65536^5) +\n              (Group five value * 65536^4) + (Group six value * 65536^3) +\n              (Group seven value * 65536^2) + (Group eight value * 65536)\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>The Code in Java</strong></p>\n<p>As long as the IP is formatted reasonably correctly this code will separate the two kinds of IP and then sort them.</p>\n<pre><code>import java.util.*;\nimport java.math.*;

To make Hibernate use UTC we set the `jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.time_zone` configuration property to `true` within our `application.yaml`. \r\n\r\nAfter moving to Spring Boot 3 and Hibernate 6 (which introduces a more specific configuration for timestamp conversion) the migration of timestamps doesn&#39;t work as expected anymore:\r\n\r\nWhen looking up entities by timestamp attributes, they won&#39;t be found. \r\n\r\n**A short example:**  \r\nSaving an entity with a `java.time.Instant` timestamp of `2023-12-13T00:00:00Z` to the database creates a new record as expected.   \r\nHowever, when trying to retrieve the record using the same timestamp the data repository will return an empty result. It therefore seems that the timestamp conversion differs between saving and querying. \r\n\r\nWe tried to adjust this behaviour using the configuration property `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.timezone.default_storage` but no matter what value we set, the behaviour kept being the same. We also tried different combinations of the `jdbc.time_zone` and `timezone.default_storage` config properties without recognizing any effects on the application&#39;s behaviour.

My Service works fine and I know my subscription mapping works as I am able to retrieve it from the command line using rsc. But when I try to fetch the subscription and use RSocketGraphQlClient, it's unable to map the field from the response. It returns Scala Map.Map1 object which it cannot caste to Entity of My Object(Simple Pojo to map response). All examples I can find work with a return type of String and are very simple, so I cannot find anything more comprehensive. Any help would be appreciated, or if you can point me to a good reference document to write a rsocket subscription client for Graphql? As I understand, I may be not coercing schema on my return object but I cant figure out if thats the case. Below is the relevant code:</p>\n<pre><code>var rsocketDoc = &quot;&quot;&quot;\n                subscription {\n                    getSecuritiesSubscription {\n                        secId\n                        rowStatusType\n                        label\n                    }\n                }\n                &quot;&quot;&quot;;\nvar d = rSocketGraphQlClient\n            .document(rsocketDoc)\n            .executeSubscription()\n            .mapNotNull(response -&gt; {\n                if (!response.isValid()) {\n                    log.info(response.getData());\n                    throw new RuntimeException(response.getErrors().toString());\n                }\n                final SecurityQl data1 = response.field(&quot;getSecuritiesSubscription&quot;).toEntity(SecurityQl.class);\n                    log.info(&quot;data &quot; + data1);\n                    return data1;\n
