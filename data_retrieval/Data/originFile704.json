Here is an example:</p>\n<p>The following class <code>MultiTenantConfiguration</code>provides all the necessary beans for configuring the datasource, sessions and transactions:</p>\n<pre><code> class MultiTenantConfiguration {\n    \n    @Bean\n    public DataSource dataSource() {\n       AbstractRoutingDataSource dataSource = new RoutingDataSource();\n       dataSource.setTargetDataSources(....);\n       dataSource.setDefaultTargetDataSource(....);\n       dataSource.afterPropertiesSet();\n       \n       return dataSource;\n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    public SessionFactory entityManagerFactory(DataSource dataSource) {\n        LocalSessionFactoryBuilder builder = new LocalSessionFactoryBuilder(dataSource);\n        builder.scanPackages(&quot;....&quot;);\n        return builder.buildSessionFactory();\n    }   \n\n    @Bean\n    public HibernateTransactionManager transactionManager(SessionFactory sessionFactory) {\n        return new HibernateTransactionManager(sessionFactory);\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The following class provides the <code>id</code> of DB source to lookup:</p>\n<pre><code>class RoutingDataSource extends AbstractRoutingDataSource {\n    \n    @Override\n    protected Object determineCurrentLookupKey() {\n        return TENANT_CONTEXT.getCurrentTenant();\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the API service which calls the internal user service:</p>\n<pre><code>class UserAPIResource {\n\n    @GET\n    @Path(&quot;/api/users_0/{id}&quot;)\n    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\n    public User getUser0(@PathParam(&quot;id&quot;) Long id) {\n        return userService.getUserForId_0(id);\n    }   \n\n    @GET\n    @Path(&quot;/api/users_1/{id}&quot;)\n    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\n    public User getUser1(@PathParam(&quot;id&quot;) Long id) {\n        return userService.getUserForId_1(id);\n    }   \n\n    @GET\n    @Path(&quot;/api/users_2/{id}&quot;)\n    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\n    public User getUser2(@PathParam(&quot;id&quot;) Long id) {\n        return userService.getUserForId_2(id);\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the  <code>UserService</code> that communicates with the JPA repo - <code>UserRepository</code>, converts it into a  consumable POJO and returns:</p>\n<pre><code>class UserService {\n    \n    @Autowired\n    UserRepository userRepo;\n\n\n    public User getUserForId_0(Long id) {\n        RawUser rawUser= userRepo.getById(id);\n        User user =  new User();\n        user.setId(rawUser.getId());\n        user.setName(rawUser.getName());\n\n        return user;\n    }\n\n    @Transactional\n    public User getUserForId_1(Long id) {\n        RawUser rawUser= userRepo.getById(id);\n        User user =  new User();\n        user.setId(rawUser.getId());\n        user.setName(rawUser.getName());\n\n        return user;\n    }\n\n\n    public User getUserForId_2(Long id) {\n        RawUser rawUser= userRepo.findById(id);\n        User user =  new User();\n        user.setId(rawUser.getId());\n        user.setName(rawUser.getName());\n\n        return user;\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is the <code>RawUser</code> entity class. It does not have any mappings to other entities:</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity\n@EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class)\nclass RawUser {\n  @Id\n  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)\n  private long id;\n\n  @Column(name = &quot;name&quot;)\n  private String name;\n\n  public long getId() {return id;}\n\n  public String getName() {return name;}\n}\n    \n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, <code>/api/users_0/1</code> throws: <code>org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy [com.db.model.User#1] - no Session</code>.</p>\n<p>However, <code>/api/users_1/1</code> and <code>/api/users_2/1</code> return successfully.</p>\n<p>The difference is that  <code>/api/users_1/1</code> which calls <code>userService.getUserForId_1()</code> is marked as <code>Transactional</code>.</p>\n<p>And <code>/api/users_2/1</code> which calls <code>userService.getUserForId_1()</code> uses <code>findById()</code> instead of <code>getById()</code>.</p>\n<p>This behavior only happens in the multi-tenant structure. So I'm guessing I'm missing  some additional configuration, specifically in Sessions/Proxy? If someone can explain this, that'd be great.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","vue.js","nginx"],"owner":{"account_id":25334822,"reputation":101,"user_id":19154125,"display_name":"mobiw"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1674573791,"creation_date":1674573791,"question_id":75223587,"body_markdown":"i need to start two jar files on nginx:\r\n\r\nFiles started, url `/` work, but url `/new` doesn&#39;t work i get error :\r\n\r\n&gt; HTTP Status 404 – Not Found\r\n\r\nMy nginx:\r\n\r\n     location /new {\r\n                    # my new version site \r\n                    #                \r\n                                                     proxy_pass https://localhost:8098/;\r\n                    #\r\n         proxy_redirect http://localhost:8098/ https://localhost:8098/;\r\n                                                               }\r\n            location / {\r\n                    # my old version site\r\n                    \r\n                     proxy_pass https://localhost:8443/;\r\n    \r\n        proxy_redirect http://localhost:8443/ https://localhost:8443/;\r\n            }\r\n\r\ni start vue+spring boot on url /new\r\n\r\nIn vue i change :\r\n   \r\n\r\n    publicPath: &#39;/new&#39;,\r\n\r\nIf i stated jar file on my local machine everythigs works fine\r\nJava and vue work on /new url\r\n\r\nBut in linux(nginx) i get error.\r\n\r\nIf i follow the link /new/new it redirect me to /new\r\n\r\n","title":"Sub path nginx with vue+java","body":"<p>i need to start two jar files on nginx:</p>\n<p>Files started, url <code>/</code> work, but url <code>/new</code> doesn't work i get error :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>HTTP Status 404 – Not Found</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My nginx:</p>\n<pre><code> location /new {\n                # my new version site \n                #                \n                                                 proxy_pass https://localhost:8098/;\n                #\n     proxy_redirect http://localhost:8098/ https://localhost:8098/;\n                                                           }\n        location / {\n                # my old version site\n                \n                 proxy_pass https://localhost:8443/;\n\n    proxy_redirect http://localhost:8443/ https://localhost:8443/;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n<p>i start vue+spring boot on url /new</p>\n<p>In vue i change :</p>\n<pre><code>publicPath: '/new',\n</code></pre>\n<p>If i stated jar file on my local machine everythigs works fine\nJava and vue work on /new url</p>\n<p>But in linux(nginx) i get error.</p>\n<p>If i follow the link /new/new it redirect me to /new</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","jpa","spring-data-jpa","orm"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":14889478,"reputation":124,"user_id":10751633,"display_name":"bosowski"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1674513338,"creation_date":1674513338,"answer_id":75215753,"question_id":75215587,"body_markdown":"It is not obvious what the `failureDO.getFailure()` returns exactly because you did not provide a method definition for the `StatusFailureDO.getFailure()` method and so I will assume that that method returns an instance of a `GeneralFailure` class (or StatusFailure that extends it).\r\n\r\nFor hibernate to successfully save objects into the database, the `@Entity` classes that you are trying to save need to consist of &quot;base&quot; types.

You don&#39;t have to keep any properties from `application.properties` in static fields. The &quot;workaround&quot; suggested by Patrick is very dirty:\r\n\r\n* you have no idea when this static field is modified\r\n* you don&#39;t know which thread modifies it&#39;s value\r\n* any thread at any time can change value of this static field and you are screwed\r\n* initializing private static field that way has no sense to me\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that when you have bean controlled by `@Service` annotation you delegate its creation to Spring container. Spring controls this bean lifecycle by creating only one bean that is shared across the whole application (of course you can change this behavior, but I refer to a default one here). In this case any static field has no sense - Spring makes sure that there is only one instance of `UserService`. And you get the error you have described, because static fields initialization happens many processor-cycles before Spring containers starts up. Here you can find more about [when static fields are initialized][1].\r\n\r\n### Suggestion\r\n\r\nIt would be much better to do something like this:\r\n\r\n    @Service\r\n    public class UserService {\r\n        private final String svnUrl;\r\n        \r\n        @Autowired\r\n        public UserService(@Value(&quot;${SVN_URL}&quot;) String svnUrl) {\r\n            this.svnUrl = svnUrl;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis approach is better for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n* constructor injection describes directly what values are needed to initialize the object\r\n* `final` field means that this value wont be changed after it gets initialized in a constructor call (you are thread safe)\r\n\r\n### Using `@ConfigurationProperties`\r\n\r\nThere is also another way to load multiple properties to a single class.

You don't have to keep any properties from <code>application.properties</code> in static fields. The \"workaround\" suggested by Patrick is very dirty:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>you have no idea when this static field is modified</li>\n<li>you don't know which thread modifies it's value</li>\n<li>any thread at any time can change value of this static field and you are screwed</li>\n<li>initializing private static field that way has no sense to me</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that when you have bean controlled by <code>@Service</code> annotation you delegate its creation to Spring container. Spring controls this bean lifecycle by creating only one bean that is shared across the whole application (of course you can change this behavior, but I refer to a default one here). In this case any static field has no sense - Spring makes sure that there is only one instance of <code>UserService</code>. And you get the error you have described, because static fields initialization happens many processor-cycles before Spring containers starts up. Here you can find more about <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/8704858/2194470\">when static fields are initialized</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Suggestion</h3>\n\n<p>It would be much better to do something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Service\npublic class UserService {\n    private final String svnUrl;\n\n    @Autowired\n    public UserService(@Value(\"${SVN_URL}\") String svnUrl) {\n        this.svnUrl = svnUrl;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This approach is better for a few reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>constructor injection describes directly what values are needed to initialize the object</li>\n<li><code>final</code> field means that this value wont be changed after it gets initialized in a constructor call (you are thread safe)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Using <code>@ConfigurationProperties</code></h3>\n\n<p>There is also another way to load multiple properties to a single class. It requires using prefix for all values you want to load to your configuration class. Consider following example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = \"test\")\npublic class TestProperties {\n\n    private String svnUrl;\n\n    private int somePort;\n\n    // ... getters and setters\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Spring will handle <code>TestProperties</code> class initialization (it will create a <code>testProperties</code> bean) and you can inject this object to any other bean initialized by Spring container.

You usually have no reason to deal with `Thread` creation manually. If you find `CompletableFuture` unsuitable for a particular task you may try the other tools/abstractions first.\r\n\r\nIf you want to proceed with the first (in the sense of faster) non‑null result, you can use something like\r\n\r\n```java\r\nCompletableFuture&lt;Integer&gt; future1 = fetchAsync(1);\r\nCompletableFuture&lt;Integer&gt; future2 = fetchAsync(2);\r\n\r\nInteger result = CompletableFuture.anyOf(future1, future2)\r\n    .thenCompose(i -&gt; i != null?\r\n        CompletableFuture.completedFuture((Integer)i):\r\n        future1.thenCombine(future2, (a, b) -&gt; a != null? a: b))\r\n    .join();\r\n```\r\n\r\n`anyOf` allows you to proceed with the first result, but regardless of its actual value. So to use the first non‑null result we need to chain another operation which will resort to `thenCombine` if the first result is `null`. This will only complete when both futures have been completed but at this point we already know that the faster result was `null` and the second is needed. The overall code will still result in `null` when both results were `null`.\r\n\r\nNote that `anyOf` accepts arbitrarily typed futures and results in a `CompletableFuture&lt;Object&gt;`.

You could also just use `i -&gt; i` to denote an identity function; that’s [mostly a stylistic choice].\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote that most complications stem from the design that tries to avoid blocking threads by always chaining a dependent operation to be executed when the previous stage has been completed. The examples above follow this principle as the final `join()` call is only for demonstration purposes; you can easily remove it and return the future, if the caller expects a future rather than being blocked.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to perform the final blocking `join()` anyway, because you need the result value immediately, you can also use\r\n\r\n```java\r\nInteger result = future1.applyToEither(future2, Function.identity()).join();\r\nif(result == null) {\r\n    Integer a = future1.join(), b = future2.join();\r\n    result = a != null? a: b;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich might be easier to read and debug. This ease of use is the motivation behind the upcoming [Virtual Threads] feature. When an action is running on a virtual thread, you don’t need to avoid blocking calls. So with this feature, if you still need to return a `CompletableFuture` without blocking the your caller thread, you can use\r\n\r\n```java\r\nCompletableFuture&lt;Integer&gt; resultFuture = future1.applyToEitherAsync(future2, r-&gt; {\r\n    if(r != null) return r;\r\n    Integer a = future1.join(), b = future2.join();\r\n    return a != null? a: b;\r\n}, Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor());\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy requesting a virtual thread for the dependent action, we can use blocking `join()` calls within the function without hesitation which makes the code simpler, in fact, similar to the previous non-asynchronous variant.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn all cases, the code will provide the faster result if it is non‑null, without waiting for the completion of the second future. But it does not stop the evaluation of the unnecessary future. Stopping an already ongoing evaluation is not supported by `CompletableFuture` at all. You can call [`cancel(…)`] on it, but this will will only [set the completion state (result) of the future to “exceptionally completed with a `CancellationException`”][1]\r\n\r\nSo whether you call `cancel` or not, the already ongoing evaluation will continue in the background and only its final result will be ignored.\r\n\r\nThis might be acceptable for some operations. If not, you would have to change the implementation of `fetchAsync` significantly. You could use an `ExecutorService` directly and [`submit`] an operation to get a `Future` which support cancellation with interruption.\r\n\r\nBut it also requires the operation’s code to be sensitive to interruption, to have an actual effect:\r\n\r\n - When calling blocking operations, use those methods that may abort and throw an `InterruptedException` and do not catch-and-continue.\r\n\r\n - When performing a long running computational intense task, poll [`Thread.interrupted()`] occasionally and bail out when `true`.\r\n\r\n[`cancel(…)`]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html#cancel(boolean)\r\n[1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html#:~:text=Method%20cancel,.\r\n[`submit`]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html#submit(java.util.concurrent.Callable)\r\n[`Thread.interrupted()`]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Thread.html#interrupted()\r\n[mostly a stylistic choice]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/28032827/2711488 &quot;Function.identity() or t-&gt;t?&quot;\r\n[Virtual Threads]: https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8277131","title":"Thread vs Runnable vs CompletableFuture in Java multi threading","body":"<p><code>CompletableFuture</code> is a tool which settles atop the <code>Executor</code>/<code>ExecutorService</code> abstraction, which has implementations dealing with <code>Runnable</code> and <code>Thread</code>.

If you do override `equals()` (and therefore `hashCode()` as well) then do it in a consistent way across all your entities.\r\n\r\n 3. Think carefully before you go with an option involving value equality.  This is usually a poor choice for mutable classes in general, and entities are no exception.\r\n\r\n## Specific Questions\r\n\r\n&gt; **1.** By considering object states in Hibernate, I think it is good practice not using id field in equals and hashCode methods, right?\r\n\r\nI think using the ID is fine.  It&#39;s simply a question of what you want equality to represent for your entities.  You absolutely can have distinct entity objects with the same type and ID, and you might want to be able to detect that with `equals()`.  The other persistent fields might or might not factor into that.\r\n\r\nIn particular, an `equals()` method based solely on entity ID might make sense for entities that appear on the &quot;many&quot; side of a one-to-many relationship when that is mapped to a `Set`.\r\n\r\n&gt; **2.** When there is a unique field in a class, is it enough to use only one of the unique fields in equals and hashCode methods (except\r\n&gt; from id field)?\r\n\r\nI see no good reason to consider only a proper subset of unique fields, except that subset consisting only of the entity ID. Or if all the fields are unique then the one consisting of all the fields *except* the ID.  The logic that suggests that you might be able to consider other proper subsets revolves around the persistent identity of the entity, which is completely and best represented by its ID.\r\n\r\n&gt; **3.** Should I add all the fields except from id field when there is not any unique field except from id field in a class? Or should I only\r\n&gt; add some numeric field instead of adding text fields?\r\n\r\nIf your sense of equality is to be based on entity value then I don&#39;t see how it makes much sense to omit any persistent fields except, possibly, the ID.  Do not arbitrarily omit the ID -- it may very well be something you want to include.  Again, it depends on what `equals()` is intended to mean for your entities.","title":"equals and hashCode with many fields in Java?","body":"<p>JPA and Hibernate don't specify or rely on any particular semantics for entities' <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code> methods, so you can do what you want.</p>\n<h2>Good alternatives</h2>\n<p>With that said, there is a handful of alternatives for equality that make much more sense to me than any others:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Equality corresponds to object identity.

After all, given that hibernate doesn&#39;t require you to do anything particular, you can do whatever you want, which leads to the obvious question: ... okay, so what should I do, then?\r\n\r\nThat question boils down to (using `Person` as an arbitrary example of a model class + associated table; furthermore, lets say the `person` table has a single unique ID that is generated (A random UUID or auto-sequenced integer value).\r\n\r\n_What does an instance of `Person` represent_?\r\n\r\nThere are in broad strokes 2 answers:\r\n\r\n* It represents a person. A row in the `person` table _also_ represents a person; these 2 things aren&#39;t related.\r\n* It represents _a row in the `person` table_.\r\n* It represents a state in my application, nothing more.\r\n\r\nEven though these things sound quite similar, they result in opposite meanings as to equality.\r\n\r\nWhich choice is correct? That&#39;s up to you.\r\n\r\nWhen reading on, remember:\r\n\r\nAny `Person` instance which isn&#39;t &quot;saved&quot; yet, would have a `null` value for `id`, because upon insertion, hibernate will ask the DB to generate a value for it or generates one itself and only then fills it in.\r\n\r\n## An instance represents a row\r\n\r\n* Equality under the second model (an instance of `Person` represents a row in the table) should look __only__ at the `id` column, because that defines row uniqueness; any 2 representations of a row in the `person` table are guaranteed to be referring to the same row (hence, _equal_) if and only if the `id` is equal. That is a necessary and sufficient condition: If they are equal the 2 objects are necessarily referring to the same row, and if they aren&#39;t equal, then they are necessarily referring to different rows.\r\n* Notably, if `id` is still `null`, then __they cannot be equal__, not even to themselves: More generally the question: &quot;Is this object-representing-a-row equal to this other object-representing-a-row&quot; is a meaningless question if these objects are representing rows-to-be (unsaved rows). If you invoke `save()` on each object, you end up with 2 rows. Optimally such an object should be considered in a state such that attempting to invoke equals on it is a failure, but the spec of `equals` states that they can&#39;t throw, therefore, `false` is the best answer. This would mean you want:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Person {\r\n  // fields\r\n  @Override public boolean equals(Object other) {\r\n    if (other == this) return true;\r\n    if (other == null || other.getClass() != Person.class) return false;\r\n    UUID otherId = ((Person) other).id;\r\n    return id == null ? false : id.equals(otherId);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis defines your equals method as &#39;ends up representing the same row&#39;. This holds _even if_ you change meaningful state:\r\n\r\n* Change the name and save the object? It&#39;s... still the same row, and this equality implementation reflects this.\r\n* Call save() on each in the comparison when they were unsaved? Then you get 2 rows - and this equality implementation reflects this before _and_ after attempting to save it. \r\n* If invoking on self (`a.equals(a)`) this returns `true` as the equality spec demands; it also works out in the &#39;modelling a row&#39; view: If you invoke save() on the same object twice, it&#39;s still just one row.\r\n\r\n## An instance represents a person\r\n\r\nThe nature of what a person is is entirely unrelated to the autosequence/autogen ID it gets; the fact that we&#39;re using hibernate is an implementation detail that should play no part at all in considering equality; after all, this object represents the notion of a person, and that notion exists entirely independent of the database. The database is one thing that is modelling persons; instances of this class are another.\r\n\r\nIn this model you should do the exact opposite: Find something that uniquely identifies a person itself, and compare against that. After all, if you have 2 rows in a database that both contain the same social security number, then you have only 1 person.. and you just happen to have 2 rows that are both referring to the same person. Given that we chose our instance to imply that it represents __a person__, then an instance loaded from row A, and an instance loaded from row B, ought to be considered as equal - after all, they are representing the same individual.\r\n\r\nIn this case, you write an equals method that considers all relevant fields __except__ the autoseq/autogen ID field! If there is a separate unique id such as social security number, use that. If there isn&#39;t, essentially it boils down to an equals method that compares all fields, _except_ ID. Because that&#39;s the one field that definitely has zero bearing on what defines a person.\r\n\r\n## An instance defines a state in your application\r\n\r\nThis is almost a cop-out, and in general means equality is irrelevant / not applicable. It&#39;s like asking how to implement an equals method to an `InputStream` implementation - mostly, you.. don&#39;t.\r\n\r\nHere, the default behaviour (`Object`&#39;s own impls) are what you want, and therefore, you don&#39;t implement either `hashCode` or `equals`. Any instance of Person is equal to itself (as in, `a.equals(a)`, same reference), and not equal to any other, even if the other has identical values for each and every field, even the id field isn&#39;t `null` (represents the same row).\r\n\r\nSuch an object cannot meaningfully be used as a value object. For example, it would be pointless to stuff such things in a hashmap (at best, you can stuff them in an `IdentityHashMap`, as those semantics would apply. Only way to do any lookups is to have a ref that was `.put()` into it before and call `.get()` with that).\r\n\r\nWhich one is right? Up to you. But document it clearly, because in my experience, lots of hibernate users are absolutely convinced either the first or second model is the one, and only, right answer, and consider the other answer utterly bonkers. This is problematic - they&#39;d be writing their code assuming __all__ hibernate model classes work precisely as they want, and would therefore not even be thinking of checking docs/impl to know how it actually works.\r\n\r\nFor what its worth, objects are objects and database rows do not neatly map to the notion of an object. SQL&#39;s and java&#39;s notion of `null` are utterly incompatible, and the notion of &#39;a query&#39; does not neatly map to tables (between selecting expressions, selecting on views, and JOINs, that should be obvious) - hibernate is tilting at windmills. It is a leaky abstraction and this is one of its many, many leaks.

You should prepare a specific set of data, and maybe mock other external sources of data, and then verify if the returned data is what you expected."}],"owner":{"account_id":15189074,"reputation":39,"user_id":18848766,"display_name":"NNFdo"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":63,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1674560668,"creation_date":1674556709,"question_id":75220292,"body_markdown":"I am trying to write unit test for the below method &quot;processStudentData&quot;. \r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Override\r\npublic List&lt;StudentsCSV&gt; processStudentData(MappingIterator&lt;Students&gt; studentsMappingIterator, String studentDetails) {\r\n    // ...\r\n\r\n    Iterators.partition(studentsMappingIterator, BATCH_SIZE)\r\n        .forEachRemaining(studentsList -&gt; processBatch(studentDetails.getStudentId()));\r\n\r\n    List&lt;StudentsCSV&gt; studentsCSVList = new ArrayList();\r\n    // ...\r\n    return studentsCSVList;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have used com.google.common.collect.Iterators.partition() inside this method.

I think this can be done using JLabels using the text of the JLabel to check against, same with a JButton.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: yes this is definitly not the proper way to do things but just wondering if it is possible, if so, how?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Just to make things a bit more clearer, I have one class that extends ActionListener, MouseMotionListener, MouseListener. is it possible to have this one class handle all events of a JFrame that has lots of different JPanels attached to it and do something different based off of which JPanel was pressed?
