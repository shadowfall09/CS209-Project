A chain of if statements, starting with the most specific and ending with the most general, is probably the best after all:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (obj instanceof SubClass1) {\n    // Handle all the methods and properties of SubClass1\n} else if (obj instanceof SubClass2) {\n    // Handle all the methods and properties of SubClass2\n} else if (obj instanceof Interface3) {\n    // Unknown class but it implements Interface3\n    // so handle those methods and properties\n} else if (obj instanceof Interface4) {\n    // likewise.  May want to also handle case of\n    // object that implements both interfaces.\n} else {\n    // New (unknown) subclass; do what I can with the base class\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","websocket"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2606744,"reputation":733,"user_id":2257772,"display_name":"benbenw"},"score":0,"creation_date":1587497447,"post_id":60545815,"comment_id":108534237,"body_markdown":"How did you check that the body was empty ?","body":"How did you check that the body was empty ?"},{"owner":{"account_id":14692591,"reputation":2143,"user_id":10610826,"display_name":"Mykhailo Moskura"},"score":0,"creation_date":1587507217,"post_id":60545815,"comment_id":108538609,"body_markdown":"Spring interceptors are not modifying response body","body":"Spring interceptors are not modifying response body"},{"owner":{"account_id":1412824,"reputation":307,"user_id":1339102,"accept_rate":50,"display_name":"Andrew Sokolov"},"score":1,"creation_date":1587573656,"post_id":60545815,"comment_id":108566751,"body_markdown":"I checked the response in Firefox console.

I am presently attempting to display data on multiple tablets from a device with a limited UDP capability.  This UDP device can only talk to one tablet at a time, and I have a tablet successfully communicating with it now, but my difficulty is trying to share this data with the other tablets.  All of these tablets are running the same app, with a setting to tell which tablet handles the communication with the UDP device.  The selected tablet also runs a TCP server, while the others run a matching TCP client.  All that I need from this TCP communication is for the server to send the clients a custom serialized object, which contains all of the data that the tablets need, at a periodic rate of once every 100ms.\r\n\r\nAfter a lot of google searches, stackoverflow searches, and experimentation, I am now running the following code.  The server tablet calls StartTxServer once to start the process, while the rest of the tablets call RunRxClient periodically every 100ms.\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate void StartTxServer() throws IOException\r\n   CustomSerial localdata;\r\n   ServerSocket server = null;\r\n\r\n   try {\r\n      server = new ServerSocket(TCP_Port) // TCP_Port is a constant int telling the port number\r\n      while(Server_Active) { // ServerActive is a boolean\r\n         Socket socket = server.accept();\r\n         InputStream streamin = socket.getInputStream();\r\n         ObjectOutputStream streamout = new ObjectOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\r\n         byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\r\n         int bytes;\r\n         bytes = streamin.read(buffer);\r\n         // The following line creates a current copy of my custom serializable object.\r\n         localdata = customdata.ConvertToSerial();\r\n         streamout.writeObject(localdata);\r\n         streamin.close();\r\n         streamout.close();\r\n         socket.close();\r\n      }\r\n   } catch (IOException e) {\r\n      Log.e(&quot;TCP_Server&quot;, &quot;Server ERROR: &quot;.concat(e.getMessage()));\r\n      e.printStackTrace();\r\n   } finally {\r\n      server.close();\r\n   }\r\n   if(Server_Active) {\r\n      Log.i(&quot;TCP_Server&quot;, &quot;Triggering a function restart&quot;);\r\n      final Runnable restartserver = new Runnable() {\r\n         @Override\r\n         public void run() {\r\n            try {\r\n               StartTxServer();\r\n            } catch (IOException e) {\r\n               e.printStackTrace();\r\n            }\r\n         }\r\n      };\r\n      threads.execute(restartserver);\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate void RunRxClient() throws IOException {\r\n   CustomSerial localdata;\r\n   Socket socket          = null;\r\n   ObjectOutputStream oos = null;\r\n   ObjectInputStream  ois = null;\r\n\r\n   try {\r\n      // IP_MasterAddressLocal is a constant IP string, which the server tablet needs to have\r\n      //    as a static address in order to work with the UDP device.\r\n      // TCP_Port is the constant int already referred to in the server function.\r\n      socket = new Socket(IP_MasterAddressLocal, TCP_Port); \r\n      socket.setSoTimeout(1000);\r\n      oos = new ObjectOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\r\n      ois = new ObjectInputStream(socket.getInputStream());\r\n      oos.writeObject(&quot;R&quot;); // Only one byte for efficiency.  Stands for &quot;Request Data&quot;.\r\n      localdata = (CustomSerial) ois.readObject();\r\n      customdata.ConvertFromSerial(localdata); // Loads data into non-serialized object for display.\r\n   } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {\r\n      Log.e(&quot;TCP_Client&quot;, &quot;ERROR: &quot;.concat(e.getMessage()));\r\n      e.printStackTrace();\r\n   } finally {\r\n      socket.close();\r\n      oos.close();\r\n      ois.close();\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this code, the server side seems to run successfully with no errors noted.  But when I connect the client tablet to my PC, I see in the Android Studio Logcat that most of the attempts at communication fail.  Usually I get an &quot;ECONNRESET&quot; error, though sometimes I see an &quot;EPIPE&quot; error instead.  From time to time, one message gets through successfully without setting either error.  When that happens, the client tablet&#39;s screen updates correctly, proving that my serialization and deserialization routines work properly.  But the client tablet&#39;s screen is quite &quot;jerky&quot;, with inconsistent updates as would be expected with the low number of successful data receptions.  As I develop this code, the tablets are right next to each other on a desk, so Wi-Fi connectivity between them should not be an issue.  The full text of sample error messages are below.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nE/TCP_Server: ERROR: java.net.SocketException: sendto failed: ECONNRESET (Connection reset by peer)\r\nW/System.err:

I have tried re-writing my functions to match the sample code of plenty of other stackoverflow pages, but the errors persist.  Alternatively, is there an easier way to do this?  Could the server simply send out data periodically without being prompted, while any clients in range silently listen?  I am open to any other suggestions for the best way to get my serialized data to the client tablets.","title":"Best way to share a serialized object among several nearby Android devices in java","body":"<p>I am a long-time programmer, but fairly new to Android tablet programming and java.  I am presently attempting to display data on multiple tablets from a device with a limited UDP capability.  This UDP device can only talk to one tablet at a time, and I have a tablet successfully communicating with it now, but my difficulty is trying to share this data with the other tablets.  All of these tablets are running the same app, with a setting to tell which tablet handles the communication with the UDP device.  The selected tablet also runs a TCP server, while the others run a matching TCP client.  All that I need from this TCP communication is for the server to send the clients a custom serialized object, which contains all of the data that the tablets need, at a periodic rate of once every 100ms.</p>\n<p>After a lot of google searches, stackoverflow searches, and experimentation, I am now running the following code.  The server tablet calls StartTxServer once to start the process, while the rest of the tablets call RunRxClient periodically every 100ms.</p>\n<pre><code>private void StartTxServer() throws IOException\n   CustomSerial localdata;\n   ServerSocket server = null;\n\n   try {\n      server = new ServerSocket(TCP_Port) // TCP_Port is a constant int telling the port number\n      while(Server_Active) { // ServerActive is a boolean\n         Socket socket = server.accept();\n         InputStream streamin = socket.getInputStream();\n         ObjectOutputStream streamout = new ObjectOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\n         byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n         int bytes;\n         bytes = streamin.read(buffer);\n         // The following line creates a current copy of my custom serializable object.\n         localdata = customdata.ConvertToSerial();\n         streamout.writeObject(localdata);\n         streamin.close();\n         streamout.close();\n         socket.close();\n      }\n   } catch (IOException e) {\n      Log.e(&quot;TCP_Server&quot;, &quot;Server ERROR: &quot;.concat(e.getMessage()));\n      e.printStackTrace();\n   } finally {\n      server.close();\n   }\n   if(Server_Active) {\n      Log.i(&quot;TCP_Server&quot;, &quot;Triggering a function restart&quot;);\n      final Runnable restartserver = new Runnable() {\n         @Override\n         public void run() {\n            try {\n               StartTxServer();\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n               e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n         }\n      };\n      threads.execute(restartserver);\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>private void RunRxClient() throws IOException {\n   CustomSerial localdata;\n   Socket socket          = null;\n   ObjectOutputStream oos = null;\n   ObjectInputStream  ois = null;\n\n   try {\n      // IP_MasterAddressLocal is a constant IP string, which the server tablet needs to have\n      //    as a static address in order to work with the UDP device.\n      // TCP_Port is the constant int already referred to in the server function.\n      socket = new Socket(IP_MasterAddressLocal, TCP_Port); \n      socket.setSoTimeout(1000);\n      oos = new ObjectOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\n      ois = new ObjectInputStream(socket.getInputStream());\n      oos.writeObject(&quot;R&quot;); // Only one byte for efficiency.

But when I connect the client tablet to my PC, I see in the Android Studio Logcat that most of the attempts at communication fail.  Usually I get an &quot;ECONNRESET&quot; error, though sometimes I see an &quot;EPIPE&quot; error instead.  From time to time, one message gets through successfully without setting either error.  When that happens, the client tablet's screen updates correctly, proving that my serialization and deserialization routines work properly.  But the client tablet's screen is quite &quot;jerky&quot;, with inconsistent updates as would be expected with the low number of successful data receptions.  As I develop this code, the tablets are right next to each other on a desk, so Wi-Fi connectivity between them should not be an issue.  The full text of sample error messages are below.</p>\n<pre><code>E/TCP_Server: ERROR: java.net.SocketException: sendto failed: ECONNRESET (Connection reset by peer)\nW/System.err:

I.e. use `List&lt;Vertex&gt;` instead of `LinkedList&lt;Vertex&gt;`. It makes your code more flexible.\r\n* In order to be able to retrieve a particular *vertex* by *label*, you can use a `Map&lt;String, Vertex&gt;` to store all vertices of the graph. With that time complexity of the `getVertex()` will be reduced to constant time, it&#39;s way faster than iterate over the list. And the code is a single line `vertexByLabel.get(label)`.\r\n* Maintaining a variable that hold a count of vertices is redundant because you can check the size of collection of vertices to get this value.\r\n* `ArrayList` performs than `LinkedList` and has a better memory consumption. For that reason, it considered to be a general purpose implementation of the `List` interface and it&#39;s a preferred choice if you don&#39;t expect use cases like removal of elements by the means of `Iterator` while iterating over the list (which will be done in constant time, here `LinkedList` really shines). Also, `HashSet` might be useful in a role of the collection of *adjacencent vertices* because it will all you to ensure that there will be no duplicates.\r\n\r\nSo in regard to `getVertex()` method, if you&#39;ll agree with the suggestion to use map, the code will look like this:\r\n```\r\nprivate Map&lt;String, Vertex&gt; vertexByLabel = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); // it is advisable to initialise collections, if you are not passing argument with collection that holds values to the constructor, but just assigning a new collection\r\n\r\npublic Vertex getVertex(String label) {\r\n   return vertexByLabel.get(label);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI also advise you to make changes to the methods `addVertex()` and `addEdge()`. Firstly, I would rather expect to a method called `addVertex()` inside the `Vertex` class (we are adding a new vertex to the adjacency list of `this` vertex) and a method `addEdge()` inside the `Graph` (we are *connecting* vertices inside the graph).\r\n\r\nAnd if order to connect the vertices method `addEdge()` of the graph will expect a vertex label as its first argument, and labes of the adjacent vertices as a [variable arity argument](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/arguments.html#varargs) (*varargs*).\r\n_________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nIn case if you have a strong requirement to utilize `LinkedLinked` exclusively and not allowed to use generic types.

It doesn't reduce complexity a lot because instead you have to deal with manual down-casts, and it's a very bad practice.</p>\n<p>Your method might look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>public Vertex getVertex(String label) {\n    Vertex result = null;\n    for (Object next: vertices) { // all elements in the collection of row type a treated by the compiler as being of type Object\n        Vertex vertex = (Vertex) next; // you need to cast the element into the Vertex type in order to be able to access its field `label`\n        if (vertex.label.equals(label)) {\n            result = vertex;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":19739293,"reputation":47,"user_id":14453002,"display_name":"Mumer"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":397,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":72026642,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1651168330,"creation_date":1651047799,"question_id":72025525,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m implementing a **Graph** in Java. \r\n\r\nThe `Graph` class uses a `LinkedList` for the *vertices*.
