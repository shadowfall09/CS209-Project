It can also contain duplicates, so it can&#39;t be a `Set`.\r\n- [`List.sublist()`][3] returns a `List` because it&#39;s simply a &quot;zoomed in&quot; view of a `List` so getting the first/last works just like any other.\r\n- [`SortedSet.subSet()`][4] returns another `SortedSet` for reasons analogous to the `List`.\r\n\r\nWhen the view happens to be a `List` then `l.get(0)` and `l.get(l.size()-1)` will return the first/last element respectively.\r\n\r\nIf the view is a `Collection` then there is no meaningful &quot;first&quot; or &quot;last&quot;, because there&#39;s no defined order. You *could* use `iterator()` and designate the first value returned by `next()` as the &quot;first&quot; and the last one as &quot;last&quot;, but that depends on the iteration order which is frequently undefined (plus iterating to the last element could be quite expensive).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html#keySet()\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html#values()\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html#subList(int,int)\r\n  [4]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/SortedSet.html#subSet(E,E)","title":"How to access the first and last value of a view in java?","body":"<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> treat views like any other collection, there's nothing special about them being views.

A few representative examples are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html#keySet()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Map.keySet()</code></a> returns a <code>Set</code> because the order of keys in a <code>Map</code> is undefined and there can't be any duplicates</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html#values()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Map.values()</code></a> returns a <code>Collection</code> because the order of its values is undefined. It can also contain duplicates, so it can't be a <code>Set</code>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html#subList(int,int)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>List.sublist()</code></a> returns a <code>List</code> because it's simply a &quot;zoomed in&quot; view of a <code>List</code> so getting the first/last works just like any other.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/SortedSet.html#subSet(E,E)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>SortedSet.subSet()</code></a> returns another <code>SortedSet</code> for reasons analogous to the <code>List</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the view happens to be a <code>List</code> then <code>l.get(0)</code> and <code>l.get(l.size()-1)</code> will return the first/last element respectively.</p>\n<p>If the view is a <code>Collection</code> then there is no meaningful &quot;first&quot; or &quot;last&quot;, because there's no defined order. You <em>could</em> use <code>iterator()</code> and designate the first value returned by <code>next()</code> as the &quot;first&quot; and the last one as &quot;last&quot;, but that depends on the iteration order which is frequently undefined (plus iterating to the last element could be quite expensive).</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":18517189,"reputation":19,"user_id":13491081,"display_name":"Ishtiaq Naqi"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":70,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1675854902,"creation_date":1675790876,"question_id":75376932,"body_markdown":"In Java a *view* is a lightweight object which implements the `Collection` or `Map` interface but is not a real collection.

I&#39;m not sure how Spring Boot testing works, but I assume there is some way to call a pre- and post- actions that can call the below Oracle commands.\r\n\r\nFirst, you will likely need to enable row movement on the relevant tables. This step is only needed once for each table and cannot be undone. (But the change is also pretty harmless. If I recall correctly, the only downside is a very tiny increase in metadata space.)\r\n\r\n```\r\nalter table my_table1 enable row movement;\r\nalter table my_table2 enable row movement;\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight before the test begins, create a uniquely named restore point that is used to record the exact system change number to roll back to.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate restore point restore_point_1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe run `data.sql` and all other testing changes.\r\n\r\nWhen testing is done, run a `FLASHBACK TABLE` command that will restore all of the relevant tables back to their state as of the restore point.\r\n\r\n```\r\nflashback table my_table1, my_table2 to restore point restore_point_1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs commenters have suggested, there are cleaner, more modern ways to instantly recreate data. But not everybody has containers or build scripts setup. I&#39;ve seen this flashback approach used successfully by testers with only a small amount of effort.\r\n\r\nThere are some potential gotchas when using flashback.

To make your code more portable and universally runnable, you should consider processing one line at a time - and splitting the input yourself, line by line. (From <a href=\"https://stackabuse.com/reading-and-writing-csvs-in-java/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://stackabuse.com/reading-and-writing-csvs-in-java/</a>)  </p>\n\n<pre><code>BufferedReader csvReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(pathToCsv));\nwhile ((row = csvReader.readLine()) != null) {\n    String[] data = row.split(\",\");\n    // do something with the data\n}\ncsvReader.close();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Caveat with the above code is that quoted commas will just be treated as new columns - you will have to add some additional processing if your CSV data contains quoted commas. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, if you really want to use your existing code, and just want to split the file, you can adapt the above:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.io.*;\n\npublic class split {\n\n    static String CSVFile=\"test.csv\";\n    static String row;\n    static BufferedReader csvReader;\n    static PrintWriter csvWriter;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {   \n\n    csvReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(CSVFile));\n\n    int line = 0;\n    while ((row = csvReader.readLine()) != null) {\n       if (line % 100000 == 0) {  // maximum lines per file\n          if (line&gt;0) { csvWriter.close(); }\n          csvWriter = new PrintWriter(\"cut-\"+Integer.toString(line)+CSVFile);\n       }\n       csvWriter.println(row);\n        // String[] data = row.split(\",\");\n        // do something with the data\n       line++;\n    }\n    csvWriter.close();\n    csvReader.close();\n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I chose PrintWriter above FileWriter or BufferedWriter because it automatically prints the relevent newlines - and I would presume that it's buffered... I've not written anything in Java in 20 years, so I bet you can improve on the above. </p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1652686,"reputation":1,"user_id":1522943,"display_name":"Shivam Maralay"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1675834942,"creation_date":1675834942,"answer_id":75381753,"question_id":60724017,"body_markdown":"I created a simple fun to create a childcsv from parent based on the start and last Range.
