I&#39;m expecting a 400 bad request but getting a 200 Ok response.\r\n\r\nThe validateToken is a void method.\r\n\r\nTest class \r\n\r\n```\r\n@SpringBootTest\r\n@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)\r\n@AutoConfigureMockMvc\r\nclass GetUserAddressControllerTest {\r\n    @Mock\r\n    private CustomerAddressService customerAddressService;\r\n\r\n    @Mock\r\n    private TokenValidator tokenValidator;\r\n\r\n    @InjectMocks\r\n    private GetUserAddressController getUserAddressController;\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    private MockMvc mockMvc;\r\n\r\n    @BeforeEach\r\n    void setup() {\r\n        MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this);\r\n        mockMvc = MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup(getUserAddressController).build();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void getAllAddressesFailureTest() throws Exception {\r\n        doThrow(new AddressBookException(RestResultCode.BAD_REQUEST, ErrorType.UNAUTHORIZED_ERROR.getStatus(), &quot;Access is denied&quot;))\r\n                .when(tokenValidator)\r\n                .validateUser(header, userId);\r\n\r\n\r\n        MvcResult mvcResult = mockMvc.perform(get(getAddressUrl)\r\n                        .param(&quot;userId&quot;, userId)\r\n                        .header(&quot;Authorization&quot;, header))\r\n                .andDo(MockMvcResultHandlers.print())\r\n                .andExpect(status().is4xxClientError())\r\n                .andReturn();\r\n\r\n        verify(customerAddressService).getAllAddresses(any());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nController class\r\n```\r\n    @ApiOperation(value = &quot;This API will fetch all address for a user&quot;)\r\n    @GetMapping(value = &quot;/addresses&quot;, produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)\r\n    CustomerAddressResponse getAllAddresses(@RequestHeader(value = &quot;Authorization&quot;, required = true) String authToken,\r\n                                            @RequestParam(&quot;userId&quot;) String userId) {\r\n\r\n        tokenValidator.validateUser(authToken, userId);  //----&gt; want exception\r\n        return customerAddressService.getAllAddresses(userId);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTokenValidator class\r\n```\r\n   public void validateUser(String authToken, String uuid) {\r\n        if (StringUtils.isEmpty(authToken)) {\r\n            throw new AddressBookException(RestResultCode.UNAUTHORIZED, ErrorType.ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR.getStatus(), &quot;Access is denied&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n        // some logic here\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nEarlier I was using the when().thenThrow() syntax, but came to know for void methods we have to use a different syntax. So I changed it. Then I tried somethings with different annotations, but could not get it working. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m expecting the exception to be thrown, but getting 200.[![enter image description

The item has a very complex data structure with nested properties and contains fields that ranges from strings, lists, arrays of strings, arrays of enums etc. There is also a complexity added where some of the fields may be returned as a null or populated with a value respective to its type.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to do is to create a pact response matcher that can be re-used for any item. At the moment, there are 120 items (each item is a separate API call with the item name in the query param of the request) that I could request information for and writing a pact matcher for each item is not feasible / maintainable.\r\n\r\nE.g. Sample response cut down ( the actual response is over 60 lines):\r\n\r\n```\r\n   return new PactDslJsonBody()\r\n                .object(&quot;metadata&quot;)\r\n                   .stringValue(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;item-1&quot;)\r\n                   .integerType(&quot;index&quot;, 1)\r\n                   .eachLike(&quot;contents&quot;)\r\n                       .stringType(&quot;param&quot;, &quot;content-param&quot;)\r\n                       .stringType(&quot;value&quot;, &quot;content-value&quot;)\r\n                   .closeArray\r\n                .closeObject\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem I have is that the field [tag:contents] could also come back as [tag:null] from the provider. What I am trying to achieve is whether I can within the same PactDslJsonBody have an **OR** condition or something similar which can check for the eachLike but also can accept that the field is null.\r\n\r\nContents field populated:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   &quot;metadata&quot;:{\r\n      &quot;name&quot;:&quot;item-1&quot;,\r\n      &quot;index&quot;:1,\r\n      &quot;contents&quot;:[\r\n         {\r\n            &quot;param&quot;:&quot;content-param&quot;,\r\n            &quot;value&quot;:&quot;content-value&quot;\r\n         }\r\n      ]\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nContents field null:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   &quot;metadata&quot;:{\r\n      &quot;name&quot;:&quot;item-1&quot;,\r\n      &quot;index&quot;:1,\r\n      &quot;contents&quot;:null\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI see there is PactDslJsonBody.or() available but the usage of this is not documented clearly, hence I am unsure if this is the intended usage for the above use case.\r\n\r\nWriting separate tests is not feasible as this is a specific use case to repeat the same PactDslJsonBody for n number of consumer tests, one for each item. We need to test each item as we have a direct mapping of some field values as enums between the consumer and provider hence we want to make sure that each item has the expected values for such fields.

The item has a very complex data structure with nested properties and contains fields that ranges from strings, lists, arrays of strings, arrays of enums etc. There is also a complexity added where some of the fields may be returned as a null or populated with a value respective to its type.</p>\n<p>What I would like to do is to create a pact response matcher that can be re-used for any item. At the moment, there are 120 items (each item is a separate API call with the item name in the query param of the request) that I could request information for and writing a pact matcher for each item is not feasible / maintainable.</p>\n<p>E.g.

The method will return the value immediately when the keyword is encountered. ***This means that the method will not execute any more statements beyond the return keyword, and any local variables created in the method will be discarded.***\r\n\r\nSo back to your case, you have the following code:\r\n```java\r\n@Override public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\r\n    binding = FragmentAlarmBinding.inflate(getLayoutInflater());\r\n    return binding.getRoot();\r\n    createNotificationChannel(); //problem is here.

And that is already an ending point of your method. All the remaining lines you have within the method will not be executed. And hence that&#39;s why **Unreachable statement** will be prompted.\r\n\r\nSo the correct code for ```onCreateView()``` function should look like this:   \r\n```java\r\n@Override public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\r\n    binding = FragmentAlarmBinding.inflate(getLayoutInflater());\r\n    return binding.getRoot();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you may wonder how to deal with the remaining lines of your method? So for a **Fragment**, after the View is being loaded with ```onCreateView()```, ```onViewCreated()``` will be called and you can do your next action there. So you should implement another override method ```onViewCreated()```:\r\n```java\r\n@Override public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\r\n    binding = FragmentAlarmBinding.inflate(getLayoutInflater());\r\n    return binding.getRoot();\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Override\r\npublic void onViewCreated(View view, Bundle savedInstanceState) {\r\n    createNotificationChannel();\r\n\r\n    binding.cancelAlarmBtn.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onClick(View v) {\r\n            cancelAlarm();\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```","title":"setContentView in Fragment for java","body":"<p>So you have to familiarize yourself with what a <code>return</code> keyword does in a method.

Return `true` when finding two equal elements:\r\n\r\nBasically, rather than\r\n```\r\nsame = true;\r\n```\r\nYou can just do\r\n```\r\nreturn true;\r\n```\r\nsince you don&#39;t care about the rest of the array; you already found a matching pair.\r\n\r\nAlthough this doesn&#39;t improve the asymptotic runtime complexity, it will speed up your code by terminating early.\r\n\r\n2. Sort the array beforehand, then compare adjacent elements:\r\n\r\nWe can use `Arrays.sort(duplicateArray);` to sort the numbers in ascending order, in only `O(n log n)` time. Now, we guarantee that equal elements are going to be next to each other, meaning that we can find the answer in `O(n)` time afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe code looks something like this (after you have received input):\r\n```\r\nArrays.sort(duplicateArray);\r\nfor (int i = 1; i &lt; duplicateArray.length; i++) {\r\n  if (duplicateArray[i] == duplicateArray[i - 1]) {\r\n    return true;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nreturn false;\r\n```\r\nThis reduces your runtime complexity to `O(n log n)`\r\n\r\n3. Use a `HashSet`:\r\n\r\n`HashSet`s have a `.contains()` method that runs in expected `O(1)` time. Therefore, if we add each number already traversed into a `HashSet`, we can check for equality in constant time. Traversing the array takes, therefore, `O(n)` time, so we can improve the `O(n log n)` solution.\r\n\r\nThe code would look like this (again after input):\r\n```\r\nSet&lt;Integer&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\r\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; duplicateArray.length; i++) {\r\n  if (set.contains(duplicateArray[i])) {\r\n    return true;\r\n  }\r\n  set.add(duplicateArray[i]);\r\n}\r\nreturn false;\r\n```\r\nThe only issue with this is that a `HashSet` will take extra space.","title":"Return true if the array contains duplicate elements (which need not be adjacent)","body":"<p>Like others have said, the problem in your code is that you compare the indices (<code>i and j</code>) rather than the values (<code>duplicateArray[i] and duplicateArray[j]</code>).</p>\n<p>Therefore, changing</p>\n<pre><code>if (i == j)\n</code></pre>\n<p>to</p>\n<pre><code>if (duplicateArray[i] == duplicateArray[j])\n</code></pre>\n<p>should fix your problem.</p>\n<p>However, to improve your solution (which is currently an <code>O(n^2)</code> algorithm since you have two nested loops that traverse the entire array), here are several methods:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Return <code>true</code> when finding two equal elements:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Basically, rather than</p>\n<pre><code>same = true;\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can just do</p>\n<pre><code>return true;\n</code></pre>\n<p>since you don't care about the rest of the array; you already found a matching pair.</p>\n<p>Although this doesn't improve the asymptotic runtime complexity, it will speed up your code by terminating early.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Sort the array beforehand, then compare adjacent elements:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can use <code>Arrays.sort(duplicateArray);</code> to sort the numbers in ascending order, in only <code>O(n log n)</code> time.
