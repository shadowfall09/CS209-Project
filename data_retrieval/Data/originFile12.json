This method allows to store of a compact version of a date which requires fewer bits to store the Date.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIt uses a total of 8 bytes to store Date and Time, let&#39;s break it down.\r\n\r\n\r\n| Bits  | Field         | Value |\r\n| ----: | :----         | :---- |\r\n|    1  | sign          |(used when on disk) |\r\n|   17  | year*13+month |(year 0-9999, month 0-12) |\r\n|    5  | day           |(0-31)|\r\n|    5  | hour          |(0-23)|\r\n|    6  | minute        |(0-59)|\r\n|    6  | second        |(0-59)|\r\n|   24  | microseconds  |(0-999999)|\r\n\r\n   Total: 64 bits = 8 bytes\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s focus on the Date part here, how it holds the date in a compact format &amp; Why multiply with 13.\r\n\r\nThe reason for choosing 13 as the multiplier is that it allows for a convenient representation of leap years. When a year is divisible by 4, it is considered a leap year and has 366 days instead of the usual 365. In the MySQL DateTime format, leap years are represented by adding 1 to the month value.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s Understand it by an example\r\n---\r\nLet&#39;s say we want to store the date (YYYY - MM): 2023-12\r\n\r\nas per the calculation  = 2023 &#215; 13 = 26299\r\n\r\nthen (+) the month = 26299 + 12 = 26311\r\n\r\nSo, the compact form of `2023-12` is `26311`\r\n\r\n### How do we extract the year and month from the compact form?\r\n\r\nfor YEAR = 26311 / 13 = 2023\r\n\r\nfor MONTH = 26311 % 13 = 12\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s how it works. for the Day there is another field of which is of 5 bits. \r\n[Check GitHub Code](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server/blob/ea1efa9822d81044b726aab20c857d5e1b7e046a/mysys/my_time.cc#L1841)\r\n\r\nThanks","title":"How datetime values are stored in mysql?","body":"<p>It uses a brilliant technique to store and retrieve the Date efficiently.

While interesting, such implementation details are subject to change, and are largely irrelevant to us as Java app developers. \r\n\r\nWhat matters is the contract laid out in documentation. To quote [the 8.2 doc][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt;The `DATETIME` type is used for values that contain both date and time parts. MySQL retrieves and displays `DATETIME` values in &#39;YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss&#39; format. The supported range is &#39;1000-01-01 00:00:00&#39; to &#39;9999-12-31 23:59:59&#39;.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;A `DATETIME` or `TIMESTAMP` value can include a trailing fractional seconds part in up to microseconds (6 digits) precision. In particular, any fractional part in a value inserted into a `DATETIME` or `TIMESTAMP` column is stored rather than discarded. With the fractional part included, the format for these values is &#39;YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss[.fraction]&#39;, the range for DATETIME values is &#39;1000-01-01 00:00:00.000000&#39; to &#39;9999-12-31 23:59:59.499999&#39;, …\r\n\r\nNote that `DATETIME` differs from `TIMESTAMP` in its ignorance of offset-from-UTC or time zone. To quote the doc again:\r\n\r\n&gt; MySQL converts `TIMESTAMP` values from the current time zone to UTC for storage, and back from UTC to the current time zone for retrieval. (This does not occur for other types such as `DATETIME`.) …\r\n\r\nSo the `DATETIME` type in MySQL is akin to the SQL standard type of `TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE`, representing merely a date &amp; time.\r\n\r\nYou said:\r\n\r\n&gt;I am sending a datetime value such as &#39;2016-04-27 09:00:00&#39; from java program\r\n\r\nIn a Java app, you should be using *java.time* date-time objects rather than mere text to exchange date-time values with the database. If you have a textual value such as `&quot;2016-04-27 09:00:00&quot;`, parse it as a `LocalDateTime`. The `LocalDateTime` class represents a date with time-of-day but lacks the context of an offset or zone.\r\n\r\nTo parse such a string, substitute the  SPACE in the middle with a `T` to comply with the [ISO 8601][2] standard. \r\n\r\n    String input = &quot;2016-04-27 09:00:00&quot;.replace( &quot; &quot; , &quot;T&quot; ) ;\r\n    LocalDateTime ldt = LocalDateTime.parse( input ) ;\r\n\r\nWrite to database in a MySQL column of the type `DATETIME`.\r\n\r\n    myPreparedStatement.setObject( … , ldt ) ;\r\n\r\nRetrieval:\r\n\r\n    LocalDateTime ldt = myResultSet.getObject( … , LocalDateTime.class ) ;\r\n\r\nYou said:\r\n\r\n&gt; whether It&#39;ll be stored as string as I have passed or mysql will parse the string\r\n\r\nNo, no serious database engine stores date-time values as text. Each database has its own internal binary representation of date-time values. \r\n\r\nIf you pass text as input to the database, the text is parsed into an internal binary format before being stored. Likewise, upon retrieval the binary formatted data retrieved is converted back to text by a console-access app or as a Java object by a JDBC driver.\r\n\r\n&gt; constructs UTC timestamp out of it and store that number into db\r\n\r\nNo, no, no! Be very careful here. The `DATETIME` type you mentioned in your Question **has *no* concept of offset or time zone**. `DATETIME` values in MySQL do not represent a moment, are not a point on the timeline. A `DATETIME` value is just a date with a time-of-day, nothing more. So if the value is noon on January 23 of 2024, we have no way to know if that is noon in Tokyo, noon in Toulouse, or noon in Toledo Ohio — three very differ9ent moments, several hours apart. A `DATETIME` value in MySQL is **inherently ambigous**! \r\n\r\nIf your goal is to track a moment, a specific point on the timeline, you must use a data type akin to the SQL standard type of `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`. In MySQL 8, that would be the MySQL type `TIMESTAMP`. In Java, the matching type defined in JDBC is `java.time.OffsetDateTime`. \r\n\r\n    OffsetDateTime odt = … ;\r\n    myPreparedStatement.setObject( … , odt ) ;\r\n\r\nRetrieval:\r\n\r\n    OffsetDateTime odt = myResultSet.getObject( … , OffsetDateTime.class ) ;\r\n\r\nWhen you write to a MySQL column of type `TIMESTAMP`, any given offset or time zone is used to adjust the moment to an offset from UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. \r\n\r\nYou asked:\r\n\r\n&gt; Will this stored value be retrieved as it is from java program, irrespective of different timezone settings of mysql server and java server ?\r\n\r\nWhen you retrieve a MySQL `DATETIME` value, you get just a date and a time-of-day, without offset or zone. When using a JDBC driver, you get a `LocalDateTime` as that is the class for a date with time-of-day that lacks the context of an offset or zone.\r\n\r\nSo time zone settings in your OS, your database engine, your database session, and your [JVM][3] are all irrelevant. A date and time go into the database, and you get back the exact same date and time upon retrieval. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, with a MySQL `TIMESTAMP` column, when writing to the database any submitted offset or zone is used to determine a value in UTC (zero offset), then stored in UTC. On retrieval, you get back a UTC value. \r\n\r\nBeware: Some **access tools and middleware may inject a time zone** or offset —&#160;after retrieving a UTC value from the database such an anti-feature may dynamically apply some default offset or zone before handing over the resulting value. No JDBC driver does this that I know of, but it definitely happens in many database access tools (unfortunately). \r\n\r\nGenerally in business apps, use `TIMESTAMP` type in MySQL as we generally care about specific moments. Use `DATETIME` type in MySQL only if you are really clear on the context, behavior, and purpose. When in doubt, use `TIMESTAMP`. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.2/en/datetime.html\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine","title":"How datetime values are stored in mysql?","body":"<h1>tl;dr</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <strong><code>TIMESTAMP</code></strong> column in MySQL to record a moment, a specific point on the timeline.

The solution that worked for me was to download the missing artifact manually via cmd:</p>\n<pre><code>mvn dependency:get -DrepoUrl=http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/ -Dartifact=ro.isdc.wro4j:wro4j-maven-plugin:1.8.0\n</code></pre>\n<p>After this change need to let know the Idea about new available artifacts. This can be done in &quot;Settings &gt; Maven &gt; Repositories&quot;, select there your &quot;Local&quot; and simply click &quot;Update&quot;.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: the -DrepoUrl seems to be deprecated. -DremoteRepositories should be used instead.
