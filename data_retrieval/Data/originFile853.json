In your given code, you only return if a certain condition is met. Otherwise, there is no return value. That&#39;s the issue with your code. \r\n\r\nOne thing you can do is to break the loop once your condition is met and then return at the end of the method.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static int wordCount(String sentence) {\r\n  int wc = 1;\r\n  for (int a = 0; a &lt;= sentence.length()-1; a++) {\r\n    if (sentence.charAt(a) == &#39; &#39;) {\r\n      wc += 1;\r\n    }\r\n    if (a == sentence.length()-1) {\r\n      break;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return wc;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in your code, you are checking the same condition twice.\r\n\r\nFirst, in your for loop, you are looping from `a = 0` to `a &lt;= sentence.length()-1`.\r\n\r\nYou can change it to this, to increase the readability of your code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfor (int a = 0; a &lt; sentence.length(); a++) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat this does is, you start your loop where `a = 0` and iterate until `a` is lesser than the length of the `sentence`. That is exactly same as &quot;until `a` is lesser than or equal to the (length of the `sentence` - `1`)&quot;. Check how the explanation of the code is also simpler here.\r\n\r\nThen inside your loop, you are checking whether `a == sentence.length() - 1` to return.

This whole MVP design is a bit confusing to me and I&#39;m trying my best to understand it and use the correct design structure but I think I am doing some things wrong. I also know that this code isn&#39;t very optimal with me drawing colored squares to artificially clear the maze or that I have a boolean in the render for the solving of the maze but I don&#39;t know what else to do as of now. \r\n\r\nThank you so much for taking a look and leaving any comments below it means a lot to me. I will continue to do research and try new things as this question is active and if I make any progress I will leave updates.","title":"How do I animate a draw call in android studio from the presenter?","body":"<h1>Issue</h1>\n<p>I have a project that I am writing where I have a maze that is randomly created with one button and and I can solve the maze with another button. The issue I am having is that I currently have the solution path drawn all at once in the presenter and then the solve method in the presenter is called in the DrawingView and is activated through a button on the MainActivity. I want each rect that I am drawing in the presenter (render) method to draw with timed pauses in between them. This is my first time using the MVP design and I have done a bunch of research on this and I am just struggling a lot to run methods that don't have the canvas passed to them.</p>\n<p>As a warning I did get rid of the imports of the classes to try to cut down a bit.</p>\n<h2>Drawing View</h2>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>class DrawingView extends View implements DrawingContract.DrawingCanvas {\n\n    private final DrawingContract.DrawingPresenter drawingPresenter;\n\n    public DrawingView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {\n        super(context, attrs);\n\n        drawingPresenter = new Presenter(this);\n    }\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {\n        super.onDraw(canvas);\n        drawingPresenter.render(canvas);\n    }\n\n    public void generateNewMaze() {\n        drawingPresenter.createMaze();\n        postInvalidate();\n    }\n\n    public void solveAndPrintMazePath() {\n        drawingPresenter.solveMaze();\n        postInvalidate();\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Presenter</h2>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class Presenter implements DrawingContract.DrawingPresenter{\n    DrawingContract.DrawingCanvas view;\n\n    //boolean for the maze path to be drawn\n    private boolean mazeIsSolved;\n\n    //2d array for maze and start/exit cells\n    private Cell[][] cells;\n    private Cell start, exit;\n\n    //Static variables for columns, rows and thickness of cell walls\n    private static final int COLS = 10, ROWS = 10;\n    private static final float WALL_THICKNESS = 4;\n\n    //Cell sizes and screen margins\n    private float cellSize, hMargin, vMargin;\n\n    //Paints\n    private Paint wallPaint, startPaint, exitPaint, cellPaint;\n\n    //Random for the maze generation\n    private Random random;\n\n    //Graph\n    private Graph mazeGraph;\n\n    //Depth first object to solve the maze\n    private DepthFirst myDFS;\n\n    public Presenter(DrawingContract.DrawingCanvas v) {\n        //Set the view\n        view = v;\n\n        //Set boolean to false so we don't draw solve path\n        mazeIsSolved = false;\n\n        //Create a new graph\n        mazeGraph = new Graph();\n\n        //Creating a paint for the walls\n        wallPaint = new Paint();\n        wallPaint.setColor(Color.WHITE);\n        wallPaint.setStrokeWidth(WALL_THICKNESS);\n\n        //Creating the paint for the start of the maze\n        startPaint = new Paint();\n        startPaint.setColor(Color.GREEN);\n\n        //Creating the paint for the exit of the maze\n        exitPaint = new Paint();\n        exitPaint.setColor(Color.BLUE);\n\n        //Creating the cell paint\n        cellPaint = new Paint();\n        cellPaint.setColor(Color.BLACK);\n\n        //Random for maze generation\n        random = new Random();\n\n        //Creating the DFS\n        myDFS = new DepthFirst();\n\n        //Creating an initial maze\n        createMaze();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void render(Canvas canvas) {\n        canvas.drawColor(Color.BLACK);\n\n        int width = canvas.getWidth();\n        int height = canvas.getHeight();\n\n        if(width/height &lt;

This is used by default for `CsvToBeanBuilder`:\r\n\r\n&gt; This builder is intelligent enough to guess the **mapping strategy** according to the following strategy:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 1. If a mapping strategy is explicitly set, it is always used.\r\n&gt; 2. If CsvBindByPosition or CsvCustomBindByPosition is present, ColumnPositionMappingStrategy is used.\r\n&gt; 3. Otherwise, `HeaderColumnNameMappingStrategy` is used. This includes the case when `CsvBindByName` or `CsvCustomBindByName` are being used. The\r\n&gt; annotations will automatically be recognized.\r\n\r\nInternally, the class [`HeaderColumnNameMappingStrategy`][3] will call `registerBinding(..)`.

The most naive method of doing this is by putting different depth thresholds in the minimax tree. For example, you can expand the minimax game tree until only depth 2 (assuming for a 3*3 tic-tac-toe) for easy level and say until the end of the search tree for the highest difficulty level. You can set this threshold depending on the board size and the difficulty level expected. \r\n\r\nAnother way of implementing difficulty levels is by implementing different heuristic functions to calculate the board score (a goodness measure to the current state of the board). You can have your heuristic function that evaluates the individual row/column/diagonal score based on the number of cells that you occupy in that row/column/diagonal. For example, if the number of cells occupied is 1, then score = x (x can be any arbitrary number). If the number of cells occupied is 2, then score = x^2 and if it is 3, then score = x^3. Then multiply all individual line scores to get a measure of goodness (or you can think of this as a winning probability) in each row, column or diagonal. You can calculate a similar score for your opponent and then take a difference to get a board score. Thus the idea is to implement different ways of evaluating current board states by designing different variations of the heuristic function for each difficulty level.

The Above code only support hard level (Impossible), how can i create easy medium and hard level in above game algorithm again computer(CPU). \r\n 2. how can i set custom icon instead of **O** and **X**\r\n 3. how can i set all three game mode randomly in above code, as easy medium and hard level, so when user start the game, cpu will come randomly, wither easy or medium or hard.  \r\n\r\nHere are some links that i have tried so far but unable to understand how to create easy medium and hard level\r\n\r\n - [Learn to create a Tic-Tac-Toe Game for Android][1]\r\n - https://stackoverflow.com/q/36072107/8112541\r\n - https://stackoverflow.com/q/45062904/8112541\r\n - [Tic-Tac-Toe (TableLayout) Android App][2]\r\n - https://stackoverflow.com/q/23302586/8112541\r\n\r\nIf need more information please do let me know.

If i would like to use a blockingqueue object to validate if one of the threads is allowed to enter their shared protocol object based on a boolean where would make the most sense to implement it? in the protocol or in the theads?"},{"owner":{"account_id":404649,"reputation":57192,"user_id":773113,"accept_rate":72,"display_name":"Mike Nakis"},"score":0,"creation_date":1669595630,"post_id":74589017,"comment_id":131671027,"body_markdown":"Asynchronous message passing using message queues is used in an entirely different way.

Example: With the addition of [Streams][8] (see below) to Java, it has become easier to write _functional code_ in Java.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, we can make use of Java _Streams._ Example:\r\n1. Create a stream of indices we want to access `A`/`B` at; namely, 0 to `size of A or B`.\r\n2. [Map][9] the indices to the differences of the elements of `A` and `B`.\r\n3. Collect the (streamed) result as a list named `C`.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\r\nimport java.util.Arrays;\r\nimport java.util.stream.IntStream;\r\n\r\npublic class FunctionalApproach {\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    ArrayList&lt;Double&gt; A = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(new Double[] {1d,2d,3d,4d,5d}));\r\n    ArrayList&lt;Double&gt; B = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(new Double[] {0d,1d,2d,3d,4d}));\r\n    \r\n    assert A.size() == B.size();\r\n    int size = A.size();\r\n    Double[] arrayC = IntStream.range(0, size)\r\n        .mapToDouble((index) -&gt; A.get(index) - B.get(index))\r\n        .boxed()\r\n        .toArray(Double[]::new);\r\n    \r\n    ArrayList&lt;Double&gt; C = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(arrayC));\r\n    \r\n    System.out.println(C); // [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n([@GrzegorzPiwowarek][10] provided [alternative and arguably better implementations][11] on [a similar but older question][12].)\r\n\r\n# Addendum\r\nThere may have been unfamiliar expressions in the examples above, which I&#39;ll try to explain in this section.\r\n\r\n## Assertions\r\nAssertions in Java are a development tool to ensure correct functionality of your code. If assertions fail, they will throw an exception. They will only run if you correctly [compile][13] and [enable][14] them.\r\n\r\nNote that **assertions do not replace proper checking!** Oracle has a [summary of when to use assertions][15].\r\n\r\nIn the examples above I use assertions _mainly to semantically describe_ that (roughly) &quot;the following code only works under the assertion&#39;s condition&quot;.\r\n\r\n## Primitives and boxed values\r\n[&lt;i&gt;(Auto-)boxing&lt;/i&gt; in Java][16] refers to converting a primitive value to its corresponding wrapper class.\r\n\r\nThis is required in places where primitives cannot be used, or rather where `Object`s are expected. Examples are [Generics][17] like `List`, for which you&#39;ll find simple explanations in [Oracle&#39;s autoboxing tutorial][16].\r\n\r\n**Be extra careful** if—in your code—references to such wrapper classes can be null: Java cannot unbox null to a primitive, instead **it will throw a runtime exception!** In the above code, no such scenario can occur.\r\n\r\n### In both approaches\r\nSince arrays are more readable and statically compile, I chose to provide the lists&#39; initial values as arrays. My implementation came with the following requirements:\r\n\r\n1. Constructing `ArrayList` with initial values requires a `Collection`.&lt;sup&gt;[\\[1\\]][18]&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n2. `Arrays.asList()` returns a `Collection`, but requires a non-primitive array (here: array of boxed values; further: boxed array).&lt;sup&gt;[\\[2\\]][19]&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n3. Initializing a boxed array (`Double[]`) requires the elements to be of the corresponding primitive type; we need to provide the numbers in type `double`.&lt;sup&gt;[\\[3\\]][20]&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n4. Declaring number literals as `double` requires us to suffix them with `d` (or use a decimal point).&lt;sup&gt;[\\[4\\]][21]&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\nThis means that this invalid code:\r\n```java\r\nArrayList&lt;double&gt; A = new double[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\r\n```\r\nNeeds to be written e.g. as follows to be valid:\r\n```java\r\nArrayList&lt;Double&gt; A = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(new Double[]{1d, 2d, 3d, 4d, 5d}));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### In the imperative approach\r\nNo further code changes are required in the imperative approach&#39;s example. Adding numbers to the list `C` autoboxes the numbers, because here no intermediate object with certain restrictions like `new Double[]` is used.\r\n\r\n### In the functional approach\r\nIn the _Streams_ example, [`IntStream.mapToDouble()`][22] returns a [`DoubleStream`][23] (a stream acting on primitives). Its [`toArray()`][24] function would return a primitive array (`double[]`), which we cannot easily provide to the construction of the list `C` as mentioned before.\r\n\r\nTherefore we first need to box it (see [`DoubleStream.boxed()`][25]), which returns a [`Stream&lt;Double&gt;`][26]. This stream&#39;s elements can then be collected in a boxed array (by providing the array&#39;s constructor, `Double[]::new`; see [Oracle&#39;s tutorial &quot;Method References&quot;][27]).\r\n\r\nSuch an array can then be used to construct a list as discussed before.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/for.html\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming#Algol\r\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function\r\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function\r\n  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science)\r\n  [7]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/16509/13561410\r\n  [8]: https://oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams.html\r\n  [9]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(higher-order_function)\r\n  [10]: https://stackoverflow.com/users/2229438/grzegorz-piwowarek\r\n  [11]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/40696146/13561410\r\n  [12]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/40644999/13561410\r\n  [13]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html#compiling\r\n  [14]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html#enable-disable\r\n  [15]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html\r\n  [16]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/autoboxing.html\r\n  [17]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generics_in_Java\r\n  [18]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html#ArrayList-java.util.Collection-\r\n  [19]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#asList-T...-\r\n  [20]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/autoboxing.html#:~:text=Passed%20as%20a%20parameter%20to%20a%20method%20that%20expects%20an%20object%20of%20the%20corresponding%20wrapper%20class.\r\n  [21]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html#:~:text=Floating%2DPoint%20Literals\r\n  [22]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/IntStream.html#mapToDouble-java.util.function.IntToDoubleFunction-\r\n  [23]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/DoubleStream.html\r\n  [24]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/DoubleStream.html#toArray--\r\n  [25]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/DoubleStream.html#boxed--\r\n  [26]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html\r\n  [27]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methodreferences.html","title":"Subtracting between two ArrayList in Java","body":"<p>TL;DR: Refer to the two complete code examples below, and their section's headings for context.</p>\n<h1>Approaches</h1>\n<h2>Imperative approach</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><i>Imperative programming</i></a> is commonly described as &quot;instructing the individual steps to achieve a certain goal&quot;.</p>\n<p>We can use <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/for.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">for-loops</a>—a language feature <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming#Algol\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">associated with imperative programming</a>—to iterate through the lists <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, and to collect the differences of their elements in the list <code>C</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class ImperativeApproach {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    ArrayList&lt;Double&gt;

You need to have multiple executions occur instead. You have a few different options for this...\r\n\r\n 1. Multiple commands. No changes needed to your pom, but this requires that your profiles have no real applicability to the actions in `release:prepare`, which you&#39;ll only run **once**. If that&#39;s *not* the case, this won&#39;t work. The first two commands could be combined into one but the third one has to be separate:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    mvn release:prepare \r\n    mvn release:perform -P profile-1\r\n    mvn release:perform -P profile-2\r\n    ```\r\n 2. Multiple `&lt;executions&gt;` of the release plugin itself, with different [`releaseProfiles`](https://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/perform-mojo.html#releaseProfiles) in each one. This is a minor variation on option 1, but might be more appealing depending on your needs:\r\n    ```\r\n        ...\r\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-release-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;executions&gt;\r\n          &lt;execution&gt;\r\n            &lt;id&gt;id-1&lt;/id&gt;\r\n            &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n              &lt;releaseProfiles&gt;profile-1&lt;/releaseProfiles&gt;\r\n            &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n          &lt;/execution&gt;\r\n          &lt;execution&gt;\r\n            &lt;id&gt;id-2&lt;/id&gt;\r\n            &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n              &lt;releaseProfiles&gt;profile-2&lt;/releaseProfiles&gt;\r\n            &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n          &lt;/execution&gt;\r\n    ...\r\n    ```\r\n    Because the release plugin isn&#39;t bound to any phase (you run it directly), you&#39;ll have to specify both executions separately on the command line, like `mvn release:prepare release:perform@id-1 release:perform@id-2`.\r\n 3. Use unique plugin execution `id`s within each profile -- then run `mvn release:prepare release:perform -P profile-1,profile-2` as usual. You&#39;d also have to change the profiles so that they use different property names. e.g.\r\n    ```xml\r\n    ...\r\n    &lt;profile&gt;\r\n      &lt;id&gt;profile-1&lt;/id&gt;\r\n      &lt;properties&gt;\r\n        &lt;namespace-1&gt;sample-1.org&lt;/namespace-1&gt;\r\n        ...\r\n              &lt;execution&gt;\r\n                &lt;id&gt;antrun-1&lt;/id&gt;\r\n                &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n                  &lt;target&gt;\r\n                    &lt;echo&gt;${namespace-1}&lt;/echo&gt;\r\n    ...\r\n    &lt;profile&gt;\r\n      &lt;id&gt;profile-2&lt;/id&gt;\r\n      &lt;properties&gt;\r\n        &lt;namespace-2&gt;sample-2.org&lt;/namespace-2&gt;\r\n        ...\r\n                &lt;id&gt;antrun-2&lt;/id&gt;\r\n                &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n                  &lt;target&gt;\r\n                    &lt;echo&gt;${namespace-2}&lt;/echo&gt;\r\n    ...\r\n    ```\r\n    ... this assumes that the all the plugin executions are such that they would be fine to run in a round-robin order like this for each phase of the overall build (`clean` phase = antrun 1 then antrun 2; `test` phase = surefire 1 then surefire 2; etc).","title":"run mvn release with several profiles","body":"<p>The second command-line (comma-separated profiles) is more correct, but won't quite do what you're trying to do, given your pom.</p>\n<p>When you specify multiple profiles, they are <em>all</em> active in the same maven process -- it doesn't mean &quot;run each goal with the first profile and then again with the second&quot;.

Its purpose is to skip the rest of the code (through to the catch). It&#39;s doing exactly what it is supposed to do, it is the same as saying &quot;skip me&quot;.\r\n\r\nSo your question &quot;how do I run the rest of the code&quot; can only be acheived by removing the code from &quot;skip me&quot; instruction.\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n        try {\r\n            myList.Insert(1, 0);\r\n            myList.Insert(5, 54); //  this is the false entry\r\n        \r\n        } catch (Exception ex) {\r\n            System.out.println(ex.toString());\r\n        }\r\n        myList.Insert(1, 0);\r\n        myList.Insert(1, 0);\r\n        myList.Out();\r\n        myList.ReverseOutput();   \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will give you the output you expect.\r\n\r\n... but it doesn&#39;t *feel* quite right\r\n\r\nIf we are removing code from the `try` it almost seems like the try isn&#39;t worth having. The thing is, that try block was put there there for **some** reason. Try blocks are supposed to catch errors and it successfully did so, so obviously its doing something useful, and taking the code out of it feels like the wrong solution.\r\n\r\nWhat we want is for *each one of the lines of code* to be tried, and if it fails, try the next one. Notice I said `try` more than once, and also &quot;each **one**&quot;\r\n\r\n```\r\n        try {\r\n            myList.Insert(1, 0);\r\n        } catch (Exception ex) {\r\n            System.out.println(ex.toString());\r\n        }\r\n        try {\r\n            myList.Insert(5, 54); //  this is the false entry\r\n        } catch (Exception ex) {\r\n            System.out.println(ex.toString());\r\n        }\r\n        try {\r\n            myList.Insert(1, 0);\r\n        } catch (Exception ex) {\r\n            System.out.println(ex.toString());\r\n        }\r\n        try {\r\n            myList.Insert(1, 0);\r\n        } catch (Exception ex) {\r\n            System.out.println(ex.toString());\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will also give you the output you want, and also handles any of those inserts kicking out an error.\r\n\r\n... but it doesn&#39;t *feel* quite right\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s a lot of repetitive text, just to do the same insert over and over. If only we had a way to repeat things?\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nint values[4][2] = {\r\n    {1,0},\r\n    {5,54},\r\n    {1,0},\r\n    {1,0}\r\n};\r\n\r\nfor(int v[2] : values){\r\n    try {\r\n        myList.Insert(v[0], v[1]);\r\n    } catch (Exception ex) {\r\n        System.out.println(ex.toString());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will give you the output you want, handles any of the inserts kicking out an error, and avoids the constant repetition.\r\n\r\n\r\n... but it doesn&#39;t *feel* quite right\r\n\r\nThere was no loop being used for that original code. I assume that was for a reason: possibly it was a test stub that will eventually be receiving values from somewhere else.\r\n\r\nThis indicates that having each item tested independantly is *the actual purpose* of this code. If so, there is a way that we could have the single line of code handle its own error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction TryInsert(list,pos,val){\r\n    try {\r\n        list.Insert(pos, val);\r\n        return true;\r\n    } catch (Exception ex) {\r\n        System.out.println(ex.toString());\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nTryInsert(mylist, 1, 0);\r\nTryInsert(mylist, 5, 54); //  this is the false entry\r\nTryInsert(mylist, 1, 0);\r\nTryInsert(mylist, 1, 0);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will give you the output you want, handles any of the inserts kicking out an error, and is more true to the original intent.\r\n\r\n... but it doesn&#39;t *feel* quite right\r\n\r\nGiven you are passing in the `myList` object to every function call, it seems like that object is the thing to be acted upon. This would indicate that this is the true desired behaviour of your `Insert` function.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you would like to alter your class, either to add this function to it, or modify the `Insert` to act on its own best judgement when the error occurs (either directly or through inheritance).\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nmyList.TryInsert(1, 0);\r\nmyList.TryInsert(5, 54); //  this is the false entry\r\nmyList.TryInsert(1, 0);\r\nmyList.TryInsert(1, 0);\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven I don&#39;t have access to your class ...

s1 -&gt; s3\n\n    s0 -&gt; s1 -&gt; s0 -&gt; s1 -&gt; s0 -&gt; s1 -&gt; s4\n\n    s0 -&gt; s1 -&gt; s0 -&gt; s5\n\n    Tracing the probabilities of each, we find that\n\n    s2 has probability 0\n\n    s3 has probability 3/14\n\n    s4 has probability 1/7\n\n    s5 has probability 9/14\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","stream","outputstream","bytearrayoutputstream"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1287942,"reputation":3456,"user_id":1240649,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"Wayneio"},"score":0,"creation_date":1556279071,"post_id":55865532,"comment_id":98393675,"body_markdown":"Ah, yes, operating on the ByteArrayOutputStream instead of the ObjectOutputStream made the difference","body":"Ah, yes, operating on the ByteArrayOutputStream instead of the ObjectOutputStream made the difference"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4497436,"reputation":18081,"user_id":3656904,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"talex"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1556292982,"creation_date":1556274065,"answer_id":55865532,"question_id":55865288,"body_markdown":"Here how you do it\r\n\r\n    ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\r\n    ObjectOutputStream stream = new ObjectOutputStream(baos);\r\n    stream.writeObject(myObject);\r\n\r\n    ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(baos.toByteArray());\r\n    ObjectInputStream inputStream = new ObjectInputStream(bais);\r\n    Object o = inputStream.readObject();\r\n","title":"Getting Object back from an ObjectOutputStream","body":"<p>Here how you do it</p>\n\n<pre><code>ByteArrayOutputStream baos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\nObjectOutputStream stream = new ObjectOutputStream(baos);\nstream.writeObject(myObject);\n\nByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(baos.toByteArray());\nObjectInputStream inputStream = new ObjectInputStream(bais);\nObject o = inputStream.readObject();\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1287942,"reputation":3456,"user_id":1240649,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"Wayneio"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":507,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":55865532,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1669534690,"creation_date":1556273111,"question_id":55865288,"body_markdown":"I have created an `ObjectOutputStream`\r\n\r\n    ObjectOutputStream stream = new ObjectOutputStream(new ByteArrayOutputStream());\r\n    stream.writeObject(myObject);\r\n\r\nbut how do I now convert this back into an `Object`, or even a `ByteArray`?\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried getting an `ObjectInputStream` like this\r\n\r\n    ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = (ByteArrayOutputStream) myProcess.getOutputStream();\r\n                \r\n    final ObjectInputStream objectInputStream = new ObjectInputStream(\r\n        new ByteArrayInputStream(outputStream.toByteArray()));\r\n\r\nhowever I get a compile error saying it can&#39;t cast the `ObjectOutputStream` to a `ByteArrayOutputStream`;
