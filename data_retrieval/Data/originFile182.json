Yet another proof of forced boilerplate code that Java forces you to write.\r\n\r\nThat said, let&#39;s look at a list of comprehensive options:\r\n\r\n 1. If you want the process output to simply be redirected to its parent&#39;s output stream, `inheritIO` will do the job.\r\n 2. If you want the process output to go to a file, use `redirect*(file)`.\r\n 3. If you want the process output to go to a logger, you need to consume the process `InputStream` in a separate thread. See the answers that use a `Runnable` or `CompletableFuture`. You can also adapt the code below to do this.\r\n 4.

See https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/test/autoconfigure/orm/jpa/DataJpaTest.html\r\n\r\nIt basically creates an ApplicationContext with only those beans regsitered that are relevant for JPA and Spring Data JPA.\r\n\r\n`@SpringBootTest` creates a complete ApplicationContext with everything that is in your application. A lot of which it finds by scanning the class path for classes annotated with `@Configuration`. \r\n\r\nTherefore it will contain more &quot;stuff&quot; and in your case two `@AuditorAware` beans.\r\nWhich some &quot;magic&quot; inside Spring tries to create a `jpaAuditingHandler` bean from. Since there are two `AuditorAware` beans we end up with two beans of same name which is not acceptable. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53139244/spring-boot-2-1-bean-override-vs-primary. You Probably could enable bean overriding but that is not recommended. \r\n\r\nWith `@DataJpaTest` these configurations are not found and you end up with no `AuditorAware` bean at all.

I will attach the link at the end. Here, I will try to explain in short.\r\n\r\n#### First important thing\r\nIf we are using pure WebSocket connections, there is a handshake process that is performed before a WebSocket connection is set up. The handshake is performed using HTTP/HTTPS (depending on your settings). After the handshake is performed, the connection is switched to WebSocket. \r\n\r\n#### Second important thing\r\nSince the handshake is performed using HTTP/HTTPS, we can cover the security needs with the usual security configuration that we use to secure endpoints. Security changes will be executed during the handshake. If the security validation is not passed, the handshake will fail and the WebSocket connection will not be set up.\r\n\r\n#### Necessary dependencies\r\nExcept for the WebSocket dependency, we need only the usual security dependency and the dependency to connect to the OAuth authorization server:\r\n```groovy\r\n implementation &#39;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server&#39;\r\n implementation &#39;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security&#39;\r\n implementation &#39;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-websocket&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Configuration\r\nIn the configuration, we just set up OAuth server validation and describe security rules for the desired endpoint.\r\n```java\r\n@Configuration\r\npublic class WebSecurityConfig {\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\r\n        return http\r\n                .authorizeHttpRequests(registry -&gt; registry\r\n                        .requestMatchers(&quot;/websocket/endpoint&quot;).hasAuthority(&quot;SCOPE_my.scope&quot;)\r\n                )\r\n                .oauth2ResourceServer(configurer -&gt; configurer\r\n                        .jwt(withDefaults())\r\n                )\r\n                .build();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### OAuth properties\r\nIn the application properties file we need to set up properties for our connections to the authorization server. In my case the server is located on `http://auth-server:9000`.\r\n```yaml\r\nspring:\r\n  security:\r\n    oauth2:\r\n      resourceserver:\r\n        jwt:\r\n          issuer-uri: http://auth-server:9000\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that&#39;s it. Now, during the handshake, the described security rules will be applied. The described application properties will be used during the connection to the authorization server. When the handshake is performed, the WebSocket connection will be set up.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Full article\r\nLink to the article (step-by-step guide): https://medium.com/@HereAndBeyond/bf479327339f","title":"Secure Websocket connections with OAuth in Spring Boot app","body":"<p>The solution is quite simple but requires some explanations, so I had to write a small article about that.

If the security validation is not passed, the handshake will fail and the WebSocket connection will not be set up.</p>\n<h4>Necessary dependencies</h4>\n<p>Except for the WebSocket dependency, we need only the usual security dependency and the dependency to connect to the OAuth authorization server:</p>\n<pre><code> implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server'\n implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security'\n implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-websocket'\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Configuration</h4>\n<p>In the configuration, we just set up OAuth server validation and describe security rules for the desired endpoint.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Configuration\npublic class WebSecurityConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\n        return http\n                .authorizeHttpRequests(registry -&gt; registry\n                        .requestMatchers(&quot;/websocket/endpoint&quot;).hasAuthority(&quot;SCOPE_my.scope&quot;)\n                )\n                .oauth2ResourceServer(configurer -&gt; configurer\n                        .jwt(withDefaults())\n                )\n                .build();\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h4>OAuth properties</h4>\n<p>In the application properties file we need to set up properties for our connections to the authorization server. In my case the server is located on <code>http://auth-server:9000</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-yaml prettyprint-override\"><code>spring:\n  security:\n    oauth2:\n      resourceserver:\n        jwt:\n          issuer-uri: http://auth-server:9000\n</code></pre>\n<p>And that's it. Now, during the handshake, the described security rules will be applied. The described application properties will be used during the connection to the authorization server. When the handshake is performed, the WebSocket connection will be set up.</p>\n<h4>Full article</h4>\n<p>Link to the article (step-by-step guide): <a href=\"https://medium.com/@HereAndBeyond/bf479327339f\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://medium.com/@HereAndBeyond/bf479327339f</a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":14860080,"reputation":934,"user_id":10731216,"display_name":"HereAndBeyond"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":150,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":77094698,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1694761007,"creation_date":1694588108,"question_id":77094697,"body_markdown":"I am going to add a WebSocket handler to my Spring Boot 3 application.

However, you can achieve your goal of using multiple XML files for named queries by slightly modifying your setup.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s how you can do it:\r\n\r\n1. Create a separate configuration class for each XML file containing named queries. You&#39;ll need a dedicated `@EnableJpaRepositories` configuration for each XML file.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;\r\nimport org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.config.EnableJpaRepositories;\r\n\r\n@Configuration\r\n@EnableJpaRepositories(namedQueriesLocation = &quot;classpath:/queries.xml&quot;)\r\npublic class JpaConfig1 {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;\r\nimport org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.config.EnableJpaRepositories;\r\n\r\n@Configuration\r\n@EnableJpaRepositories(namedQueriesLocation = &quot;classpath:/queries2.xml&quot;)\r\npublic class JpaConfig2 {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. In your main application configuration class, include these additional configuration classes by using the `@Import` annotation:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;\r\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Import;\r\n\r\n@Configuration\r\n@Import({ JpaConfig1.class, JpaConfig2.class })\r\npublic class MainApplicationConfig {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, you have two separate configurations for named queries from `queries.xml` and `queries2.xml`. You can use these configurations in different parts of your application. When you define your repositories, make sure to specify the correct configuration class in the `@EnableJpaRepositories` annotation on your repository interface.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have a repository interface `UserRepository`, you can specify which configuration to use like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;\r\nimport org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.config.EnableJpaRepositories;\r\n\r\n@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = &quot;com.example.repository&quot;, // Specify your repository package\r\n                      entityManagerFactoryRef = &quot;entityManagerFactoryBeanName&quot;,\r\n                      repositoryFactoryBeanClass = JpaRepositoryFactoryBean.class,\r\n                      repositoryBaseClass = SimpleJpaRepository.class,\r\n                      namedQueriesLocation = &quot;classpath:/queries.xml&quot;) // Choose the correct XML file\r\npublic interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;User, Long&gt; {\r\n    // Your repository methods here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRepeat this process for other repositories that need to use the queries from different XML files.

So it seems that they are not different.</p>\n<p>Can someone explain the difference in this example?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","maven","javafx","package"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1180113,"reputation":152325,"user_id":1155209,"display_name":"jewelsea"},"score":2,"creation_date":1694734964,"post_id":77108899,"comment_id":135934052,"body_markdown":"It should be `java  -jar &lt;programName.jar&gt;` and you also need a main class defined in the jar and meta inf plus execution is different of [a shaded jar including JavaFX components is not supported, though you might get it to work.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52653836/maven-shade-javafx-runtime-components-are-missing).","body":"It should be <code>java  -jar &lt;programName.jar&gt;</code> and you also need a main class defined in the jar and meta inf plus execution is different of <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52653836/maven-shade-javafx-runtime-components-are-missing\">a shaded jar including JavaFX components is not supported, though you might get it to work.</a>."},{"owner":{"account_id":47283,"reputation":703817,"user_id":139985,"accept_rate":69,"display_name":"Stephen C"},"score":0,"creation_date":1694735993,"post_id":77108899,"comment_id":135934139,"body_markdown":"In the duplink 1st answer, look for &quot;Alternative syntaxes for java&quot; which explains (among other things) how to execute a JAR file.","body":"In the duplink 1st answer, look for &quot;Alternative syntaxes for java&quot; which explains (among other things) how to execute a JAR file."},{"owner":{"account_id":16533811,"reputation":13,"user_id":11946356,"display_name":"Titan"},"score":0,"creation_date":1694738863,"post_id":77108899,"comment_id":135934310,"body_markdown":"is there a better and simpler way to package my application for the user to use it without going for technical stuff","body":"is there a better and simpler way to package my application for the user to use it without going for technical stuff"},{"owner":{"account_id":1180113,"reputation":152325,"user_id":1155209,"display_name":"jewelsea"},"score":0,"creation_date":1694745672,"post_id":77108899,"comment_id":135934797,"body_markdown":"You can use jpackage, it is simpler for the user but more difficult for you the developer.
