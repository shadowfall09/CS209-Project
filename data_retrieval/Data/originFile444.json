However, HTTPInputStream .available() returns the number of bytes available for reading before a blocking IO request needs to be made to refill the buffer. (See the Java Docs for more info)\r\n\r\nThe problem is that GZIPInputStream uses the output of .available() to determine if there might be an additional GZIP file available in the InputStream after it finishes decompressing a complete GZIP file. Here is line 231 from OpenJDK source file [GZIPInputStream.java]( http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/jdk/file/0e4fc29a5ce4/src/share/classes/java/util/zip/GZIPInputStream.java) method readTrailer(). \r\n\r\n       if (this.in.available() &gt; 0 || n &gt; 26) {\r\n\r\nIf the HTTPInputStream read buffer empties right at the boundary of two concatenated GZIP files GZIPInputStream calls .available(), which responds with a 0 as it would need to go out to the network to refill the buffer, and so GZIPInputStream treats the file as complete and closes prematurely.\r\n\r\nThe Common Crawl .wet archives are hundreds of megabytes of small concatenated GZIP files and so eventually the HTTPInputStream buffer will empty right at the end of one of the concatenated GZIP files and GZIPInputStream will close prematurely. This explains the problem demonstrated in the question.\r\n\r\n### Solution and Work Around ###\r\n\r\nThis [GIST](https://gist.github.com/jeffharwell/2e8785a0ec8acc8539901e841d595394) contains a patch to jdk8u152-b00 revision 12039 and two jtreg tests that remove the (in my humble opinion) incorrect reliance on .available().\r\n\r\nIf you cannot patch the JDK a work around is to make sure that available() always returns &gt; 0 which forces GZIPInputStream to always check for another GZIP file in the stream. Unfortunately HTTPInputStream is private so you cannot subclass it directly, instead extend InputStream and wrap the HTTPInputStream. The below code demonstrates this work around.\r\n\r\n### Demonstration Code and Output ###\r\n\r\nHere is the output showing that when the HTTPInputStream is wrapped as discussed GZIPInputStream will produces identical results when reading the concatenated GZIP from a file and directly from HTTP.\r\n\r\n    Testing URL https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698540409.8/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00009-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\r\n    Testing HTTP Input Stream direct to GZIPInputStream\r\n    Testing saving to file before decompression\r\n    Read 448974935 bytes from HTTP-&gt;GZIP\r\n    Read 448974935 bytes from HTTP-&gt;file-&gt;GZIP\r\n    Output from HTTP-&gt;GZIP saved to file testfile0.wet\r\n    ------\r\n    Testing URL https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698540409.8/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00040-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\r\n    Testing HTTP Input Stream direct to GZIPInputStream\r\n    Testing saving to file before decompression\r\n    Read 451171329 bytes from HTTP-&gt;GZIP\r\n    Read 451171329 bytes from HTTP-&gt;file-&gt;GZIP\r\n    Output from HTTP-&gt;GZIP saved to file testfile40.wet\r\n    ------\r\n    Testing URL https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698541142.66/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170901-00500-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\r\n    Testing HTTP Input Stream direct to GZIPInputStream\r\n    Testing saving to file before decompression\r\n    Read 453183600 bytes from HTTP-&gt;GZIP\r\n    Read 453183600 bytes from HTTP-&gt;file-&gt;GZIP\r\n    Output from HTTP-&gt;GZIP saved to file testfile500.wet\r\n\r\nHere is the demonstration code from the question modified with an InputStream wrapper.\r\n\r\n    import java.net.*;\r\n    import java.io.*;\r\n    import java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream;\r\n    import java.nio.channels.*;\r\n    \r\n    public class GZIPTest {\r\n        // Here is a wrapper class that wraps an InputStream\r\n        // but always returns &gt;

This explains the problem demonstrated in the question.</p>\n\n<h3>Solution and Work Around</h3>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/jeffharwell/2e8785a0ec8acc8539901e841d595394\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GIST</a> contains a patch to jdk8u152-b00 revision 12039 and two jtreg tests that remove the (in my humble opinion) incorrect reliance on .available().</p>\n\n<p>If you cannot patch the JDK a work around is to make sure that available() always returns > 0 which forces GZIPInputStream to always check for another GZIP file in the stream. Unfortunately HTTPInputStream is private so you cannot subclass it directly, instead extend InputStream and wrap the HTTPInputStream. The below code demonstrates this work around.</p>\n\n<h3>Demonstration Code and Output</h3>\n\n<p>Here is the output showing that when the HTTPInputStream is wrapped as discussed GZIPInputStream will produces identical results when reading the concatenated GZIP from a file and directly from HTTP.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Testing URL https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698540409.8/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00009-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\nTesting HTTP Input Stream direct to GZIPInputStream\nTesting saving to file before decompression\nRead 448974935 bytes from HTTP-&gt;GZIP\nRead 448974935 bytes from HTTP-&gt;file-&gt;GZIP\nOutput from HTTP-&gt;GZIP saved to file testfile0.wet\n------\nTesting URL https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698540409.8/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00040-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\nTesting HTTP Input Stream direct to GZIPInputStream\nTesting saving to file before decompression\nRead 451171329 bytes from HTTP-&gt;GZIP\nRead 451171329 bytes from HTTP-&gt;file-&gt;GZIP\nOutput from HTTP-&gt;GZIP saved to file testfile40.wet\n------\nTesting URL https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698541142.66/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170901-00500-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\nTesting HTTP Input Stream direct to GZIPInputStream\nTesting saving to file before decompression\nRead 453183600 bytes from HTTP-&gt;GZIP\nRead 453183600 bytes from HTTP-&gt;file-&gt;GZIP\nOutput from HTTP-&gt;GZIP saved to file testfile500.wet\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is the demonstration code from the question modified with an InputStream wrapper.</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.net.*;\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream;\nimport java.nio.channels.*;\n\npublic class GZIPTest {\n    // Here is a wrapper class that wraps an InputStream\n    // but always returns &gt;

I pulled the Common Crawl WET archive down locally (wget), uncompressed it (gunzip 1.8), then recompressed it (gzip 1.8) and re-uploaded to S3 and the on-the-fly decompression then worked fine. You can see the test if you modify the sample code above to include the following lines:\r\n\r\n    // Original file from CommonCrawl hosted on S3\r\n    URL originals3 = new URL(&quot;https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698540409.8/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00009-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz&quot;);\r\n    // Recompressed file hosted on S3\r\n    URL rezippeds3 = new URL(&quot;https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/com.jeffharwell.commoncrawl.gziptestbucket/CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00009-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    test(originals3, &quot;originalhost.txt&quot;);\r\n    test(rezippeds3, &quot;rezippedhost.txt&quot;);\r\n\r\nURL rezippeds3 points to the WET archive file that I downloaded, decompressed and recompressed, then re-uploaded to S3. You will see the following output:\r\n\r\n    Testing URL https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698540409.8/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00009-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\r\n    Testing HTTP Input Stream direct to GZIPInputStream\r\n    Testing saving to file before decompression\r\n    Read 7212400 bytes from HTTP-&gt;GZIP\r\n    Read 448974935 bytes from HTTP-&gt;file-&gt;GZIP\r\n    Output from HTTP-&gt;GZIP saved to file originals3.txt\r\n    -----\r\n    Testing URL https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/com.jeffharwell.commoncrawl.gziptestbucket/CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00009-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\r\n    Testing HTTP Input Stream direct to GZIPInputStream\r\n    Testing saving to file before decompression\r\n    Read 448974935 bytes from HTTP-&gt;GZIP\r\n    Read 448974935 bytes from HTTP-&gt;file-&gt;GZIP\r\n    Output from HTTP-&gt;GZIP saved to file rezippeds3.txt\r\n\r\nAs you can see once the file was recompressed I was able to stream it through GZIPInputStream and get the entire file. The original file still shows the usual premature end of the decompression. When I downloaded and uploaded the WET file without recompressing it I got the same incomplete streaming behavior so it was definitely the recompression that fixed it. I also put both files, the original and the recompressed, onto a traditional Apache web server and was able to replicate the results, so S3 doesn&#39;t seem to have anything to do with the problem.\r\n\r\nSo.

Isn&#39;t an input stream just an input stream??","title":"GZIPInputStream closes prematurely when decompressing HTTPInputStream","body":"<h2>Question</h2>\n\n<p><em>See updated question in edit section below</em></p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to decompress large (~300M) GZIPed files from Amazon S3 on the fly using GZIPInputStream but it only outputs a portion of the file; however, if I download to the filesystem before decompression then GZIPInputStream will decompress the entire file.</p>\n\n<p>How can I get GZIPInputStream to decompress the entire HTTPInputStream and not just the first part of it?</p>\n\n<h2>What I've Tried</h2>\n\n<p><em>see update in the edit section below</em></p>\n\n<p>I suspected a HTTP problem except that no exceptions are ever thrown, GZIPInputStream returns a fairly consistent chunk of the file each time and, as far as I can tell, it always breaks on a WET record boundary although the boundary it picks is different for each URL (which is very strange as everything is being treated as a binary stream, no parsing of the WET records in the file is happening at all.)</p>\n\n<p>The closest question I could find is \n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31275728/gzipinputstream-is-prematurely-closed-when-reading-from-s3\">GZIPInputStream is prematurely closed when reading from s3</a> The answer to that question was that some GZIP files are actually multiple appended GZIP files and GZIPInputStream doesn't handle that well. However, if that is the case here why would GZIPInputStream work fine on a local copy of the file?</p>\n\n<h2>Demonstration Code and Output</h2>\n\n<p>Below is a piece of sample code that demonstrates the problem I am seeing. I've tested it with Java 1.8.0_72 and 1.8.0_112 on two different Linux computers on two different networks with similar results. I expect the byte count from the decompressed HTTPInputStream to be identical to the byte count from the decompressed local copy of the file, but the decompressed HTTPInputStream is much smaller.</p>\n\nOutput\n\n<pre><code>Testing URL https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698540409.8/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00009-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\nTesting HTTP Input Stream direct to GZIPInputStream\nTesting saving to file before decompression\nRead 87894 bytes from HTTP-&gt;GZIP\nRead 448974935 bytes from HTTP-&gt;file-&gt;GZIP\nOutput from HTTP-&gt;GZIP saved to file testfile0.wet\n------\nTesting URL https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698540409.8/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00040-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\nTesting HTTP Input Stream direct to GZIPInputStream\nTesting saving to file before decompression\nRead 1772936 bytes from HTTP-&gt;GZIP\nRead 451171329 bytes from HTTP-&gt;file-&gt;GZIP\nOutput from HTTP-&gt;GZIP saved to file testfile40.wet\n------\nTesting URL https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698541142.66/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170901-00500-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\nTesting HTTP Input Stream direct to GZIPInputStream\nTesting saving to file before decompression\nRead 89217 bytes from HTTP-&gt;GZIP\nRead 453183600 bytes from HTTP-&gt;file-&gt;GZIP\nOutput from HTTP-&gt;GZIP saved to file testfile500.wet\n</code></pre>\n\nSample Code\n\n<pre><code>import java.net.*;\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream;\nimport java.nio.channels.*;\n\npublic class GZIPTest {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        // Our three test files from CommonCrawl\n        URL url0 = new URL(\"https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698540409.8/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00009-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\");\n        URL url40 = new URL(\"https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698540409.8/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00040-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\");\n        URL url500 = new URL(\"https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698541142.66/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170901-00500-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\");\n\n        /*\n         * Test the URLs and display the results\n         */\n        test(url0, \"testfile0.wet\");\n        System.out.println(\"------\");\n        test(url40, \"testfile40.wet\");\n        System.out.println(\"------\");\n        test(url500, \"testfile500.wet\");\n    }\n\n    public static void test(URL url, String testGZFileName) throws Exception {\n        System.out.println(\"Testing URL \"+url.toString());\n\n        // First directly wrap the HTTPInputStream with GZIPInputStream\n        // and count the number of bytes we read\n        // Go ahead and save the extracted stream to a file for further inspection\n        System.out.println(\"Testing HTTP Input Stream direct to GZIPInputStream\");\n        int bytesFromGZIPDirect = 0;\n        URLConnection urlConnection = url.openConnection();\n        FileOutputStream directGZIPOutStream = new FileOutputStream(\"./\"+testGZFileName);\n\n        // FIRST TEST - Decompress from HTTPInputStream\n        GZIPInputStream gzipishttp = new GZIPInputStream(urlConnection.getInputStream());\n\n        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n        int bytesRead = -1;\n        while ((bytesRead = gzipishttp.read(buffer, 0, 1024)) != -1) {\n            bytesFromGZIPDirect += bytesRead;\n            directGZIPOutStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);

I pulled the Common Crawl WET archive down locally (wget), uncompressed it (gunzip 1.8), then recompressed it (gzip 1.8) and re-uploaded to S3 and the on-the-fly decompression then worked fine. You can see the test if you modify the sample code above to include the following lines:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Original file from CommonCrawl hosted on S3\nURL originals3 = new URL(\"https://commoncrawl.s3.amazonaws.com/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2016-50/segments/1480698540409.8/wet/CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00009-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\");\n// Recompressed file hosted on S3\nURL rezippeds3 = new URL(\"https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/com.jeffharwell.commoncrawl.gziptestbucket/CC-MAIN-20161202170900-00009-ip-10-31-129-80.ec2.internal.warc.wet.gz\");\n\ntest(originals3, \"originalhost.txt\");\ntest(rezippeds3, \"rezippedhost.txt\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>URL rezippeds3 points to the WET archive file that I downloaded, decompressed and recompressed, then re-uploaded to S3.

The original file still shows the usual premature end of the decompression. When I downloaded and uploaded the WET file without recompressing it I got the same incomplete streaming behavior so it was definitely the recompression that fixed it. I also put both files, the original and the recompressed, onto a traditional Apache web server and was able to replicate the results, so S3 doesn't seem to have anything to do with the problem.</p>\n\n<p>So. I have a new question.</p>\n\n<h2>New Question</h2>\n\n<p>Why would a FileInputStream behave differently than a HTTPInputStream when reading the same content.

You are using versions of three major products that have all been released in the past month, so it is hardly surprising that there may be compatibility issues."}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3576533,"reputation":16716,"user_id":2985643,"accept_rate":40,"display_name":"skomisa"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1683757673,"creation_date":1683757673,"answer_id":76222963,"question_id":76222165,"body_markdown":"I can reproduce your problem.

the shadow and once for the fill and this would be an entirely valid approach, except, I&#39;d include blurring the shadow, because it &quot;looks&quot; nicer (IMHO)\r\n\r\n&gt; Is there any way that the drop shadow could be blurred? \r\n\r\nAs stated, the answer is based on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13368103/jpanel-drop-shadow/13369038#13369038 which makes use of [JH Labs image filters](http://www.jhlabs.com/ip/filters/index.html) to produced the blurring.\r\n\r\nIf you want to re-enable the blurring, then you will need to download the `Filters.jar` from [JH Labs](http://www.jhlabs.com/ip/filters/index.html) and link it to your project (no going to describe how to do that).\r\n\r\nOnce you&#39;ve done that, modify the `ImageUtilities` class&#39;s `generateBlur` method to reinstate\r\n\r\n    GaussianFilter filter = new GaussianFilter(size);\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n    imgBlur = filter.filter(imgBlur, null);\r\n\r\nlines and blurring will once again be implemented.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/kv5E4.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/QwEjO.png\r\n  [3]:

Search for elements form second table in the hash table. The time complexity depends on the hash function. You can achieve O(1) for searches in the optimal case (all elements will have different hash value), but O(n) in the worst case (all elements will have the same hash value). Total time complexity: O(n^x), where x is a factor of hash function efficiency (between 1 and 2).\r\n\r\nSome hash functions are guaranteed to build a table with no collisions. But the building no longer takes strictly O(1) time for every element.

For my case locate `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.16.1.jdk/Contents/Home/lib/security`. If list you will see a file `cacerts` which is a collection of trusted certificates. we need to import our downloaded certificate here using the command `sudo keytool -importcert -alias maven -file ~/Desktop/repo.maven.apache.org.cer -keystore cacerts`. Note for my case I downloaded the certificate to trust on my Desktop folder and named `repo.maven.apache.org.cer`. When prompted enter you password and `changeit` for truststore. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n 2. Next we need to trust the certificate within our IDE&#39;s security folder.  `cd /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA 19.05.39.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home/lib/security`.

For my case locate <code>/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.16.1.jdk/Contents/Home/lib/security</code>. If list you will see a file <code>cacerts</code> which is a collection of trusted certificates. we need to import our downloaded certificate here using the command <code>sudo keytool -importcert -alias maven -file ~/Desktop/repo.maven.apache.org.cer -keystore cacerts</code>. Note for my case I downloaded the certificate to trust on my Desktop folder and named <code>repo.maven.apache.org.cer</code>. When prompted enter you password and <code>changeit</code> for truststore.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Next we need to trust the certificate within our IDE's security folder.  <code>cd /Applications/IntelliJ IDEA 19.05.39.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home/lib/security</code>. Note my IDE's version as the location my change abit based on the version of IDE you are using.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Import the downloaded certificate using <code>sudo keytool -importcert -alias maven -file ~/Desktop/repo.maven.apache.org.cer -keystore cacerts</code>. Enter your user password when prompted and <code>changeit</code> for keystore password.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Restart your IDE.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":20173909,"reputation":15,"user_id":14796060,"display_name":"AnxiousGuy"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":4735,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1683752872,"creation_date":1667887883,"question_id":74356366,"body_markdown":"I am getting error\r\n```\r\n22:00:17.222 [pool-6-thread-1] ERROR ingrian.internal.xml.XMLAuthToken - handshakeCompleted: SSL handshake did not complete within alloted time {}\r\njavax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target\r\n\tat sun.security.ssl.Alert.createSSLException(Alert.java:131) ~[?:1.8.0_351]\r\n```\r\nin my Intellij IDE, when I am running any Java file, but when I am running ```mvn clean install```, the build is getting successful.

I found your code hard to follow, and likely overwrought. Java has an industry-leading date-time framework in the *java.time* classes, defined in JSR 310. Make use of that.\r\n\r\n# Use `javax.swing.Timer`, not your own threads\r\n\r\nAs others commented, for a Swing app, you should be using the [`javax.swing.Timer`][1] class (or [SwingWorker][2]) rather than counting down in your own threads and executor service. See [Tutorial][3] by Oracle.\r\n\r\n# Tracking time to elapse\r\n\r\nAs to your specific question about determining the days, hours, minutes, seconds, and nanos remaining before a particular moment:\r\n\r\n - Decide whether you want to track your span of time (a) by calendar days or, (b) by generic 24-hour chunked “days”. \r\n - Store your target moment. \r\n - Capture the current moment.\r\n - Calculate elapsed time. \r\n\r\nI will assume you want 24-hour chunked days rather than calendar days.\r\n\r\nThe `Instant` class represents a moment, a specific point on the timeline, as seen in UTC (an offset from UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds). \r\n\r\nThe `Duration` class represents a span of time unattached to the timeline, on a scale of 24-hour generic days, hours, minutes, seconds, and nanos.\r\n\r\n    Duration week = Duration.ofDays( 7 ) ;  // 7 * 24 hours = 1 week, ignoring calendar, ignoring time zones.\r\n    Instant target = Instant.now().plus( week ) ;\r\n\r\nWhen your timer task runs, capture the current moment, and calculate time remaining.\r\n\r\n    Duration timeRemaining = Duration.between( Instant.now() , target ) ;\r\n\r\nCheck to see if the remaining duration [is positive][4] or [is negative][5]. \r\n\r\n - If positive, the target is still in the future. So report its current value. \r\n - If negative, the target has passed. So recalculate the next target, the next week out. And report the new value.\r\n\r\n## Example code\r\n\r\nHere is a class to track the repeating weekly countdown.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage work.basil.example.time;\r\n\r\nimport java.time.*;\r\n\r\npublic class Weekly\r\n{\r\n    private final Duration week = Duration.ofDays( 7 );\r\n    private Instant target = Instant.now().plus( week );\r\n\r\n    public Duration timeRemaining ( )\r\n    {\r\n        Duration timeRemaining = Duration.between( Instant.now() , target );\r\n        if ( timeRemaining.isNegative() )  // If the current moment is *after* the target, calculate a new target.\r\n        {\r\n            target = target.plus( week );\r\n            timeRemaining = Duration.between( Instant.now() , target );\r\n        }\r\n        return timeRemaining;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to report on the next target moment, add a `getter` method that returns an `Instant`. The *java.time* objects such as `Instant` are [immutable][6], so no need to make a copy when returning.\r\n\r\nHere is some code to exercise that `Weekly` class. The `Weekly#timeRemaining` method is what your `SwingTimer` code will call.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nWeekly weekly = new Weekly();\r\n\r\nDuration duration = weekly.timeRemaining() ;\r\nSystem.out.println( duration );\r\n\r\ntry { Thread.sleep( Duration.ofSeconds( 3 ) ); } catch ( InterruptedException e ) { throw new RuntimeException( e ); }\r\nSystem.out.println( weekly.timeRemaining() );\r\ntry { Thread.sleep( Duration.ofSeconds( 30 ) ); } catch ( InterruptedException e ) { throw new RuntimeException( e ); }\r\nSystem.out.println( weekly.timeRemaining() );\r\ntry { Thread.sleep( Duration.ofMinutes( 5 ) ); } catch ( InterruptedException e ) { throw new RuntimeException( e ); }\r\nSystem.out.println( weekly.timeRemaining() );\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen run:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPT167H59M59.999799S\r\nPT167H59M56.994437S\r\nPT167H59M26.989259S\r\nPT167H54M26.987014S\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Generate text\r\n\r\nLastly, you want to generate text to represent this countdown value. \r\n\r\nYou can interrogate the `Duration` objects for its parts, a number of generic 24-hour days (not related to the calendar), hours, minutes, seconds, and nanos. Use the various `to…Part` methods on the [`Duration`][7] class. \r\n\r\n    long days = duration.toDaysPart() ;\r\n    int hours = duration.toHoursPart() ;\r\n    int minutes = duration.toMinutesPart() ;\r\n    int seconds = duration.toSecondsPart() ;\r\n\r\nCombine those [numbers together as a string][8].\r\n\r\n    String output = \r\n        String.format(\r\n            &quot;Time remaining: %d days, %d hours,  %d minutes,  %d seconds&quot;, \r\n            days, \r\n            hours, \r\n            minutes, \r\n            seconds \r\n        ) \r\n    ;\r\n\r\n&gt;Time remaining: 6 days, 23 hours,  59 minutes,  59 seconds\r\n\r\nDisplay that text in your [JLabel][9] widget.

This is my method body:</p>\n<pre><code>public Clip playAudio(String audioFilePath, int loopCount, float startVolume) throws Exception {\n\n    File audioFile = new File(audioFilePath);\n    \n    // File exists\n    if (audioFile.exists()) {\n        AudioInputStream audioInput = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream(audioFile);\n        Clip clip = AudioSystem.getClip();\n        clip.open(audioInput);\n        FloatControl volume = (FloatControl) clip.getControl(FloatControl.Type.MASTER_GAIN); // This throws my error\n        volume.setValue(startVolume);\n        clip.loop(loopCount);\n        return clip;\n    }\n    // File does not exist\n    else {\n        System.out.println(&quot;Audio file does not exist.&quot;);\n        return null;\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>For whatever reason, I can call this just fine on short and long audio files, all WAVs, but some trigger the error above. Once I triggered the error and then &quot;fixed&quot; it by just changing the startVolume amount I passed to the function.</p>\n<p>I've tried having the program wait 50ms before trying to set the volume, changing the input levels, having only one audio file play, etc. Different files behave just fine, but for some reason this one file doesn't work. It's the only thing that changes between method calls. I have opened the clip before setting gain like I'm supposed to as well.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","arraylist"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":74704,"reputation":11534,"user_id":214525,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"f1sh"},"score":1,"creation_date":1683740839,"post_id":76221212,"comment_id":134414700,"body_markdown":"`tempList[0] = 100;` overwrites the array element. `x = 200` only overwrites the local variable `x` which has no reference to the list where the previous value came from.","body":"<code>tempList[0] = 100;</code> overwrites the array element. <code>x = 200</code> only overwrites the local variable <code>x</code> which has no reference to the list where the previous value came from."},{"owner":{"account_id":2792262,"reputation":163877,"user_id":2402272,"accept_rate":85,"display_name":"John Bollinger"},"score":0,"creation_date":1683742304,"post_id":76221212,"comment_id":134414984,"body_markdown":"Your two examples are not analogous.

If I copy my page from my address book and hand you the copy, then:\r\n\r\n* If you tear you copy to pieces, I don&#39;t care.

This second snippet is the equivalent of walking to the address on it and tossing bricks.\r\n\r\n## Immutables\r\n\r\nWhat you can _do_ once you dereference a pointer depends on what kind of object is at the end of that pointer. For example, if it is an array, I can change a value of it, and you can&#39;t stop me from doing this (java does not have &#39;read only arrays&#39; or some such). If it is, say, an `AtomicInteger`, I can call `.set(10)` on it and change the value it represents.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the object&#39;s class has no accessible methods that change any of its state, then it&#39;s like a house that is bullet proof.

But i cannot use this code to manipulate an Order. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn fact, in my Controller (since i&#39;m using an MVC pattern) i have an Order, which is a Map&lt;Dish, Integer&gt; to store the quantity. The behaviour i want is that when i press the &#39;plus&#39; button in the &quot;Pizza&quot; TitledPane (for example) it &quot;retrieves&quot; the Dish, and calls a *updateOrder(dish, quantity)* method in the controller that should work in a similar way:\r\n\r\n ```\r\npublic void updateOrder(Dish dish, Integer quantity){\r\n   order.put(dish, quantity);\r\n}\r\n ``` \r\n\r\nBut the way i stuctured my code, i don&#39;t have access to the Dish stored in its TitledPane, since they are dinamically created and after the for cycle ends, i no longer have access to the &#39;Dish&#39; that &quot;corresponds&quot; to its titledpane. I don&#39;t know how could i implement this.\r\n\r\nAlso, the &#39;quantity&#39; variable is just a graphic thing right now, its not binded to the Order. I&#39;d like that when my &#39;Pizza&#39; dish in the order has a quantity of 0, the quantity shown in the titledpane is 0, and when i press &#39;+&#39; 3 times, the quantity in the order gets incremented, thus incrementing the quantity in the titledpane. \r\n\r\nPlease remember i&#39;m just a University student with little to no knowledge on the best way to solve this.","title":"JavaFX, how can i bind dinamically created Increment and Decrement Buttons to manipulate a specific object?","body":"<p>I hope i will formulate this question the best i can.</p>\n<p>I'm making a restaurant manager program for an university project using JavaFX and Springboot for my backend.

But i cannot use this code to manipulate an Order.</p>\n<p>In fact, in my Controller (since i'm using an MVC pattern) i have an Order, which is a Map&lt;Dish, Integer&gt; to store the quantity. The behaviour i want is that when i press the 'plus' button in the &quot;Pizza&quot; TitledPane (for example) it &quot;retrieves&quot; the Dish, and calls a <em>updateOrder(dish, quantity)</em> method in the controller that should work in a similar way:</p>\n<pre><code>public void updateOrder(Dish dish, Integer quantity){\n  order.put(dish, quantity);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>But the way i stuctured my code, i don't have access to the Dish stored in its TitledPane, since they are dinamically created and after the for cycle ends, i no longer have access to the 'Dish' that &quot;corresponds&quot; to its titledpane. I don't know how could i implement this.</p>\n<p>Also, the 'quantity' variable is just a graphic thing right now, its not binded to the Order. I'd like that when my 'Pizza' dish in the order has a quantity of 0, the quantity shown in the titledpane is 0, and when i press '+' 3 times, the quantity in the order gets incremented, thus incrementing the quantity in the titledpane.</p>\n<p>Please remember i'm just a University student with little to no knowledge on the best way to solve this.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","string"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2063229,"reputation":29168,"user_id":1839336,"accept_rate":68,"display_name":"GrIsHu"},"score":0,"creation_date":1377323629,"post_id":18415411,"comment_id":27052314,"body_markdown":"Try to clean your application from `Project-&gt;clean`.","body":"Try to clean your application from <code>Project-&gt;clean</code>."},{"owner":{"account_id":2907992,"reputation":2994,"user_id":2492841,"accept_rate":44,"display_name":"Exceptional"},"score":0,"creation_date":1377324260,"post_id":18415411,"comment_id":27052425,"body_markdown":"refresh/clean may help u","body":"refresh/clean may help u"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1940050,"reputation":763,"user_id":1746441,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"nidhi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":true,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1377324234,"creation_date":1377324234,"answer_id":18415502,"question_id":18415411,"body_markdown":"Sometimes when you declare the strings in the **strings.xml** and then try to use those using **R.string.** immediately, eclipse is not able to generate its id in **.R** file which is auto generated and stored ids.... so whenever such things happens, you should always make sure that you **save all the files** and **clean** and **build** the project.\r\n\r\nIn almost all such cases, just save, clean and build will work prevented it is some special case.\r\n\r\nAll the best.","title":"Android: String from strings.xml not showing when using (R.string.id)","body":"<p>Sometimes when you declare the strings in the <strong>strings.xml</strong> and then try to use those using <strong>R.string.</strong> immediately, eclipse is not able to generate its id in <strong>.R</strong> file which is auto generated and stored ids.... so whenever such things happens, you should always make sure that you <strong>save all the files</strong> and <strong>clean</strong> and <strong>build</strong> the project.</p>\n\n<p>In almost all such cases, just save, clean and build will work prevented it is some special case.</p>\n\n<p>All the best.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1626664,"reputation":34767,"user_id":1502079,"accept_rate":56,"display_name":"vovahost"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1418208352,"creation_date":1418208352,"answer_id":27399037,"question_id":18415411,"body_markdown":"I had the same problem. &lt;br&gt;

Meaning, if you established it in a correct way, it will be there, with all its implications (unless there is a bug in the compiler).\r\n\r\nHowever, establishing *just any* happens-before relationship doesn&#39;t guarantee that you&#39;ve avoided all possible [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition). You need to establish carefully chosen relationships between relevant operations, that will eliminate all scenarios when data race is possible.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s review this code snippet:\r\n```cpp\r\n// Thread 1\r\nx.store(1, std::memory_order_release);\r\n\r\n// Thread 2\r\ny.store(1, std::memory_order_release);\r\n\r\n// Thread 3\r\nwhile (x.load(std::memory_order_acquire) != 1);\r\nif (y.load(std::memory_order_acquire) == 0) {\r\n  x_then_y = true;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Thread 4\r\nwhile (y.load(std::memory_order_acquire) != 1);\r\nif (x.load(std::memory_order_acquire) == 0) {\r\n  y_then_x = true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you see, `T1` and `T2` update `x` and `y` using `memory_order_release` memory ordering. `T3` and `T4` use `memory_order_acquire`. \r\n\r\nNow, to quote cppreference:\r\n\r\n&gt; Release-Acquire ordering\r\nIf an atomic store in thread `A` is tagged `memory_order_release` and an atomic load in thread `B` from the same variable is tagged `memory_order_acquire`, all memory writes (non-atomic and relaxed atomic) that happened-before the atomic store from the point of view of thread `A`, become visible side-effects in thread `B`. That is, once the atomic load is completed, thread `B` is guaranteed to see everything thread `A` wrote to memory.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The synchronization is established only between the threads releasing and acquiring the same atomic variable. **Other threads can see different order of memory accesses than either or both of the synchronized threads.**\r\n\r\nIt explicitly says, that only relations between the `store-load` pairs in corresponding threads is established. **No relation between `load-load` pairs is formed.** Back to our example, the happens-before relations would form the following graph:\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/cdn3L.png&quot; height=&quot;200&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there is no relation between T1 and T2, or T3 and T4, and no total order. T3 and T4 are free to see side-effects from T1 and T2 in any order.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThat code snippet above was used in `cppreference` to illustrate the case, when `memory_order_acquire` + `memory_order_release` may be too weak to avoid data race (but that doesn&#39;t mean that this example violates happens-before or memory model, it&#39;s just that having happens-before may not be sufficient to avoid all possible data races!).\r\n\r\nIf `memory_order_seq_cst` was used for all operations in the example above, then the happens-before would&#39;ve been additionally established between `load` operations in T3 and T4.\r\n\r\nMeaning, that when first `while(x.load) != 1` or `while(y.load) != 1` passes, it **guarantees** that following `x.load` or `y.load` in another thread will have the result of `1`, ensuring that `x_then_y` and `y_then_x` cannot be true in the same time.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nNote, in java atomic and `volatile` operations always work similarly to `memory_order_seq_cst` for simplicity (sacrificing performance in some cases).","title":"Can release+acquire break happens-before?","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>I would like to know if release+acquire can violate happens-before.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happened-before\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Happens-before relationship</a> cannot be &quot;violated&quot;, as it is a <strong>guarantee</strong>.

Sequenced-before is just program order within each thread, and synchronizes-with occurs when an acquire load takes its value from a release store.  So in your program, in order to have both assertions pass, the following relations must hold:\r\n\r\n1. `T3.x==1` happens before `T3.y==0` (sequencing)\r\n2. `T4.y==1` happens before `T4.x==0` (likewise)\r\n3. `T1.x=1` happens before `T3.x==1` (acquire load takes its value from release store)\r\n4. `T2.y=1` happens before `T4.y==1` (likewise)\r\n5. `T1.x=1` happens before `T3.y==0` (for transitivity)\r\n6. `T2.y=1` happens before `T4.x==0` (likewise)\r\n\r\nYou may check that this satisfies all the axioms of a partial ordering (antisymmetric and transitive) as well as all the C++ coherence rules implied by both assertions passing.  For instance, it must not be the case that `T2.y=1` happens before `T3.y==0`, and indeed there is no such relation in our ordering.  But it is also not true that `T3.y==0` happens before `T2.y=1`, and there is nothing wrong with that; it is a **partial** order after all.  `T2.y=1` and `T3.y==0` are simply unordered.\r\n\r\nSince there is a valid happens-before ordering that is consistent with both assertions passing, it is possible that when you run the program, both assertions pass.\r\n\r\nIt is true that if some happens-before relation existed between `T3.y==0` and `T2.y=1` in either direction, and likewise between `T4.x==0` and `T1.x=1`, then every combination would result in some violation of the rules: either a violation of coherence, or a cycle in the partial order.  But again, it is perfectly fine for them to be unordered, and then no violation occurs.\r\n\r\nIf the loads and stores were all relaxed, or even if `x` and `y` were not atomic at all, then relations 3 and 4 above would not be implied by any rule, and so the happens-before ordering would become simply:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. `T3.x==1` happens before `T3.y==0` (sequencing)\r\n2. `T4.y==1` happens before `T4.x==0` (likewise)\r\n\r\nThis is **also** consistent with both assertions passing.  (In the non-atomic case, the fact that `T1.x=1` is unordered with the loads of `x` would mean there is a data race, and therefore the behavior is undefined in C++.  In a different language like Java, we might have defined behavior saying that both loads succeed and return either 0 or 1, but we could still have both assertions pass.)  If you think that changing the program to use non-atomic loads and stores would prevent both assertions from passing, you are mistaken.\r\n\r\nSo having acquire and release actually *strengthens* the ordering; there are *more* relations that must hold, and the behavior of the program becomes *better* defined.","title":"Can release+acquire break happens-before?","body":"<p>Happens-before is the transitive closure of sequenced-before and synchronizes-with.

So in your program, in order to have both assertions pass, the following relations must hold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>T3.x==1</code> happens before <code>T3.y==0</code> (sequencing)</li>\n<li><code>T4.y==1</code> happens before <code>T4.x==0</code> (likewise)</li>\n<li><code>T1.x=1</code> happens before <code>T3.x==1</code> (acquire load takes its value from release store)</li>\n<li><code>T2.y=1</code> happens before <code>T4.y==1</code> (likewise)</li>\n<li><code>T1.x=1</code> happens before <code>T3.y==0</code> (for transitivity)</li>\n<li><code>T2.y=1</code> happens before <code>T4.x==0</code> (likewise)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You may check that this satisfies all the axioms of a partial ordering (antisymmetric and transitive) as well as all the C++ coherence rules implied by both assertions passing.  For instance, it must not be the case that <code>T2.y=1</code> happens before <code>T3.y==0</code>, and indeed there is no such relation in our ordering.  But it is also not true that <code>T3.y==0</code> happens before <code>T2.y=1</code>, and there is nothing wrong with that; it is a <strong>partial</strong> order after all.  <code>T2.y=1</code> and <code>T3.y==0</code> are simply unordered.</p>\n<p>Since there is a valid happens-before ordering that is consistent with both assertions passing, it is possible that when you run the program, both assertions pass.</p>\n<p>It is true that if some happens-before relation existed between <code>T3.y==0</code> and <code>T2.y=1</code> in either direction, and likewise between <code>T4.x==0</code> and <code>T1.x=1</code>, then every combination would result in some violation of the rules: either a violation of coherence, or a cycle in the partial order.  But again, it is perfectly fine for them to be unordered, and then no violation occurs.</p>\n<p>If the loads and stores were all relaxed, or even if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> were not atomic at all, then relations 3 and 4 above would not be implied by any rule, and so the happens-before ordering would become simply:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>T3.x==1</code> happens before <code>T3.y==0</code> (sequencing)</li>\n<li><code>T4.y==1</code> happens before <code>T4.x==0</code> (likewise)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is <strong>also</strong> consistent with both assertions passing.  (In the non-atomic case, the fact that <code>T1.x=1</code> is unordered with the loads of <code>x</code> would mean there is a data race, and therefore the behavior is undefined in C++.  In a different language like Java, we might have defined behavior saying that both loads succeed and return either 0 or 1, but we could still have both assertions pass.)  If you think that changing the program to use non-atomic loads and stores would prevent both assertions from passing, you are mistaken.</p>\n<p>So having acquire and release actually <em>strengthens</em> the ordering; there are <em>more</em> relations that must hold, and the behavior of the program becomes <em>better</em> defined.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"display_name":"user17295426"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1683738111,"creation_date":1636649230,"answer_id":69931961,"question_id":69791898,"body_markdown":"**Answer: no, release/acquire cannot break happens-before.**\r\n\r\nThe proof is given by Nate Eldredge in [this comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69791898/can-releaseacquire-break-happens-before#comment123438560_69804962):\r\n&gt; Oh, indeed.

y.load(memory_order_acquire) == 0)\r\n// Thread 4\r\nassert(y.load(memory_order_acquire) == 1 &amp;&amp; x.load(memory_order_acquire) == 0)\r\n```\r\nHere both `assert`s can pass, which means that `Thread 3` and `Thread 4` see writes to `x` and `y` in different order.\r\n\r\n&lt;del&gt;As I understand, if it were ordinary variables, then this would violate the asymmetry property of happens-before.\r\nBut because x and y are atomics it&#39;s OK.\r\n(BTW I am not sure about that)&lt;/del&gt;  \r\nNate Eldredge [demonstrated in his answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69804962) that this IRIW example is OK.\r\n\r\nBut I still have a sneaking suspicion that there might be something similar to IRIW which would cause `Thread 3` and `Thread 4` to see regular writes to happen-before in different order — this would break happens-before (it wouldn&#39;t be transitive anymore).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##### Note1 #####\r\n\r\nIn [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order) there is also this quote:\r\n&gt; The implementation is required to ensure that the happens-before relation is acyclic, by introducing additional synchronization if necessary (it can only be necessary if a consume operation is involved, see Batty et al) \r\n\r\nThe quote hints that there might be cases when `happens-before` is violated and which require additional synchronization (&quot;acyclic&quot; means that happens-before forms a [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph), which is equivalent to saying &quot;strict partial order&quot;).\r\n\r\nIf it&#39;s possible I would like to know what are these cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##### Note2 #####\r\n\r\nSince java allows data races, I&#39;m also interested in cases when `happens-before` is violated only in presence of data races.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##### Edit 1 (03 Nov 2021) #####\r\n\r\nTo give you an example, here is a explanation why sequentially consistent (SC) atomics cannot violate `happens-before`.  \r\n(A similar explanation for release/acquire atomics would be an answer to my question).\r\n\r\nBy &quot;violate `happens-before`&quot; I mean &quot;to violate axioms of `happens-before`, which is a [strict partial order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_partial_order#Strict_partial_order)&quot;.\r\n\r\nStrict partial orders [correspond directly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_partial_order#Directed_acyclic_graphs) to [directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph).\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a DAG from wiki (note that it has no cycles):  \r\n![DAG](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Tred-G.svg)\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s show that with SC atomics `happens-before` graph stays acyclic.\r\n\r\nRemember that SC atomics happen in a global order (the same for all threads), and:\r\n* the order is consistent with the order of actions within each thread\r\n* every SC atomic read sees the latest SC atomic write in this total order to the same variable\r\n\r\nLook at this `happens-before` graph:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n Thread1  Thread2  Thread3 \r\n =======  =======  ======= \r\n    │        │        │    \r\n   W(x)      │        │    \r\n    ↓        │        │    \r\n   Sw(a) ┐   │       W(y)  \r\n    │    │   │        ↓    \r\n    │    └&gt; Sr(a)  ┌ Sw(b) \r\n    │        ↓     │  │    \r\n    │       Sr(b)&lt;─┘  │    \r\n    │        ↓        │    \r\n    │       R(x)      │    \r\n    │        ↓        │    \r\n    │       R(y)      │    \r\n    │        │        │    \r\n    V        V        V    \r\n```\r\nOn the graph:\r\n- time flows downwards\r\n- `W(x)` and `R(x)` are regular actions: write and read of `x`\r\n- `Sw(a)` and `Sr(a)` are SC atomics: write and read of `a`\r\n- within each thread actions happen in a program order (aka `sequenced-before order` in C++): in the order they go in the code\r\n- between threads `happens-before` is established by SC atomics\r\n\r\nNote that arrows on the graph always go downwards  \r\n =&gt; the graph cannot have cycles  \r\n =&gt; it&#39;s always a DAG  \r\n =&gt; `happens-before` axioms cannot be violated\r\n\r\nThe same proof doesn&#39;t work for `release/acquire` atomics because (as far as I understand) they don&#39;t happen in a global order =&gt; a HB arrow between `Sw(a)` and `Sr(a)` might go upwards =&gt; a cycle is possible.

In the getting started with reactor it is explained that reactor works as conveyor belt. There are two phases, the `assembly` phase and the `subscription` phase. You can read about it [here][1].\r\n\r\nWhat this actually means is that you can&#39;t leave any mono/flux dangling, you always need to chain on the last operator, so that reactive java can react to the previous functions outcome.\r\n\r\nYou have so called *broken the chain*.\r\n\r\nyou need to chain onto `someThing`. Here i do it with `then`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nMono&lt;Void&gt; someThing = moviesInfoService.deleteMovieInfoById(id);\r\nMono&lt;ResponseEntity&gt; response = someThing.then(ServerResponse.noContent().build());\r\nreturn response;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour example 3 is a bit tricker to spot, and that is because of an implicit understanding that you can&#39;t map something that is `Void`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nMono&lt;Void&gt; result = moviesInfoService.deleteMovieInfoById(id);\r\nMono&lt;ResponseEntity&gt; result2 = result.map(m -&gt; ResponseEntity.noContent().build());\r\nreturn result2\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your example what would `m` be? the function before returned `Mono&lt;Void` so `m` would be what? And that&#39;s the thing if your function before doesn&#39;t return anything, it wont run the `map` function after.\r\n\r\nSo basically `map` is not the operator to use here `then` or `thenReturn` is what should be used.\r\n\r\nLast example works and is the most idiomatic solution.\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn moviesInfoService \r\n                .getMovieInfoById(id)\r\n                .flatMap(fm -&gt; moviesInfoService.deleteMovieInfoById(fm.getMovieInfoId()))\r\n                .then(Mono.just(ResponseEntity.noContent().build()));\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can then rewrite this into something more verbose:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid Mono&lt;ServerResponse&gt; deleteMovie() {\r\n\tfinal MovieService movieService = new MovieService();\r\n\treturn movieService.get(&quot;Terminator&quot;).flatMap(name -&gt; {\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;calling delete on: &quot; + name);\r\n\t\treturn movieService.delete(name);\r\n\t})\r\n\t.then(ServerResponse.noContent().build())\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic class MovieService {\r\n\r\n\tpublic Mono&lt;String&gt; get(String s) {\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;fetching &quot; + s);\r\n\t\treturn Mono.just(s);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic Mono&lt;Void&gt; delete(String s) {\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;deleting &quot; + s);\r\n\t\treturn Mono.empty();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you see it this way\r\n- you are fetching something\r\n- then calling `flatMap` on what is fetched, and this is allowed since we have something we can `flatMap` on. \r\n- We then call `delete` inside the `flatMap` and since we are returning a `Mono&lt;Void&gt;` which basically just tells the reactive chain that *we are done and nothing was returned* \r\n- we&#39;ll then only react to the completion of the last step and call `then`, where we return a `ServerResponse`.\r\n\r\nYou **always** have to chain on the last thing you did.\r\n\r\nMost of this is explained in the [getting started with reactive programming][2] part of the reactive documentation and you are getting downvotes because its been answered many times before here on Stack Overflow.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://spring.io/blog/2019/03/06/flight-of-the-flux-1-assembly-vs-subscription\r\n  [2]: https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#intro-reactive","title":"Confustion with Mono.just vs then(Mono.just)","body":"<p>Why its not working is because you are <em>breaking the chain</em>, and you haven't read what the operators actually do.</p>\n<pre><code> return moviesInfoService.deleteMovieInfoById(id)\n                .then(Mono.just(ResponseEntity.noContent().build()));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here <code>deleteMovieInfoById</code> returns a value, you then call the <code>then</code> operator which will (when the earlier function completes) discard that value, and instead return <code>ResponseEntity.noContent().build()</code>.</p>\n<p>You can just write <code>.then(ServerResponse.noContent().build())</code> since <code>ServerResponse</code> will give you a <code>Mono</code> instead, or if you insist on returning a <code>ResponseEntity</code> you can instead use the <code>thenReturn(ResponseEntity.noContent().build())</code> which will wrap it in a <code>Mono</code> for you automatically.</p>\n<p><code>ResponseEntity</code> is from the <code>http</code> package which means its more generic, while <code>ServerResponse</code> is from the <code>reactive</code> package so its more of a convenience.</p>\n<p>The second one does not work because if we rewrite it more exploded we get:</p>\n<pre><code>Mono&lt;Void&gt; someThing = moviesInfoService.deleteMovieInfoById(id);\nMono&lt;ResponseEntity&gt; response = Mono.just(ResponseEntity.noContent().build());\nreturn response;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And as you can see here, you have two <code>Mono's</code> while one of them (the top one) is unused.

[shallow-vs-deep][3]\r\n    - shallow - a Java `record`\r\n    - middle - a Java `enum`\r\n    - deep - java.lang.`String`\r\n 3. [total-vs-effective][4]\r\n    - class-level versus instance-level immutability\r\n    - deals with the runtime timing of when the instance becomes irreversibly immutable\r\n 4. verified-vs-trusted\r\n    - deals with reversing an instance&#39;s immutability via Java reflection (innocent or malicious)\r\n\r\nDetecting immutability in Java isn&#39;t an either/or. It is predicated on a spectrum of anticipated trust. To the degree one has control of one&#39;s environment correlates strongly to the degree the trust of any detected immutability. This trust continuum has been [discretized][5] into the Java `enum`, `ImmutabilityType`, below. The `enum` enables client code to decide upon what level of trust it would prefer to rely.\r\n\r\nWhile it would be highly desirable to a large number of software engineers, Java does not provide compile-time enforced immutability detection. As an analog to Rust&#39;s beautiful memory management solution to C/C++&#39;s undesirable memory utilization potholes, it would be a huge leap forward if/when Java acquired compile-time enforced immutability detection. However, this doesn&#39;t currently appear on any known Java roadmaps (as of 2023/Jan).\r\n\r\n**Distinction 2:**\r\n\r\nThe use of the word &quot;calcification&quot; will describe the process of an instance moving from a mutable (writable or fluid) to an irreversibly immutable (read-only or calcified) state.\r\n\r\nEvery instantiation of a class involves a period of time where the instance is mutable. IOW, the default state of an instance, upon creation, is mutability. This means it is the responsibility of the class designer to decide if, and then when, the class becomes irreversibly immutable. If desiring immutability, this actually simplifies to deciding whether the instance remains mutable past the end of the execution of its constructor.\r\n\r\n**Distinction 3:**\r\n\r\nBecause immutability is about permanently calcifying the state of an instance of a class, it is important to distinguish at run-time BY WHEN the state has become irreversibly immutable.\r\n\r\nThe archetype, or ideal, for implementing immutability is to design the state to be calcified by the end of the execution of the class&#39;s constructor for a given instance. However, there are contexts where it is required to delay the calcification until sometime after the constructor completes execution. Whether this is due to poor design choices is outside the scope of this response, as the use cases exist and must be addressed.\r\n\r\n**Distinction 4:**\r\n\r\nDue to the implications of the last distinction, detecting immutability must be done at each of the class and the instance levels. The description of class level immutability applies to all instance of that class. The description of instance level immutability applies to some subset of instances from their parent class.\r\n\r\nAs such, defining two different functions is needed for detecting immutability. One which takes a `Class&lt;?&gt;` as a parameter and returns the class level of immutability. And another which takes an `Object` instance as a parameter returns the instance-level of immutability at that point during runtime.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**Working on the problem space**\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic enum ImmutabilityType {\r\n  UNDEFINED,    //unable to assert any trustable degree of deep immutability\r\n  PROPERTY_IRREVERSIBLY_IMMUTABLE, //trusting a post-instantiation window of mutability requiring an ImmutableEffective.isIrreversiblyImmutable() style of check\r\n  BEFORE_END_OF_CLASS_CONSTRUCTOR,  //trusting the implementor to properly enforce the Immutable contract, see Immutable interface Javadoc\r\n  JAVA_CONSTANT //trusting the Java compiler and platform\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis Java `enum` describes the kinds of immutability detected.\r\n\r\nThe JavaDoc for the &quot;immutability contract&quot; referenced by the comment following the `ImmutabilityType.BEFORE_END_OF_CLASS_CONSTRUCTOR` enum instance is located [here][6].\r\n\r\n**Two Target Functions:**\r\n\r\nUsing the `ImmutabilityType` enum as their return type, the two target functions are defined below. The first function, `classIs()`, detects class-level immutability. And the second function, `instanceIs()`, detects instance-level immutability. \r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static ImmutabilityType classIs(Class&lt;?&gt; class___) { ... }\r\n\r\npublic static ImmutabilityType instanceIs(Object o) { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo implement the two target functions, the infrastructure supporting them must be defined.\r\n\r\n**Subset of well-known Java Platform immutable classes:**\r\n```java\r\nprivate static final Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; SUBSET_OF_KNOWN_JAVA_PLATFORM_IMMUTABLE_CLASSES =\r\n  Set.of(\r\n    //Meta-classes\r\n    Class.class, MethodType.class,\r\n    //primitive class wrappers\r\n    Boolean.class, Byte.class, Short.class, Character.class, Integer.class, Long.class, Float.class, Double.class,\r\n    //classes\r\n    String.class, BigInteger.class, BigDecimal.class\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is just a small subset of the many immutable classes defined in the Java platform. Many more can and should be added, like `java.time.ZonedDateTime`, etc.\r\n\r\n**Java Platform Types:**\r\n```java\r\npublic static Optional&lt;ImmutabilityType&gt; classIsJavaConstant(Class&lt;?&gt; class___) {\r\n  return SUBSET_OF_KNOWN_JAVA_PLATFORM_IMMUTABLE_CLASSES.contains(class___)\r\n            || Constable.class.isAssignableFrom(class___)    //Covers: MethodHandle\r\n            || ConstantDesc.class.isAssignableFrom(class___) //Covers: ClassDesc, MethodTypeDesc, MethodHandleDesc, and DynamicConstantDesc\r\n            || class___.isEnum()\r\n          ? Optional.of(ImmutabilityType.JAVA_CONSTANT)\r\n          : Optional.empty();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat risky to include the `class___.isEnum()` check. A Java enum is technically too open to assume by-default-immutabililty, even though the vast majority of its actual in the field usages are for the default enum which is immutable at the level of the Java platform.\r\n\r\nWhile this particular implementation example doesn&#39;t offer the option, a design enhancement would enable some form of registering of an enum as mutable (`ImmutabilityType.UNDEFINED`), overriding the return value from this function.\r\n\r\n**Java Record:**\r\n```java\r\nprivate static ImmutabilityType internalClassIsRecord(Class&lt;Record&gt; classRecord) {\r\n  var resolvedImmutabilityType = ImmutabilityType.JAVA_CONSTANT;\r\n  var recordComponents = Arrays.stream(classRecord.getRecordComponents()).iterator();\r\n  while ((resolvedImmutabilityType != ImmutabilityType.UNDEFINED) &amp;&amp; recordComponents.hasNext()) {\r\n    var recordComponent = recordComponents.next();\r\n    if (!recordComponent.getType().isPrimitive()) { //within a Record, a primitive is always immutable\r\n      var immutabilityType = classIs(recordComponent.getType());\r\n      if (immutabilityType.ordinal() &lt; resolvedImmutabilityType.ordinal())\r\n        resolvedImmutabilityType = immutabilityType;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return resolvedImmutabilityType;\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static Optional&lt;ImmutabilityType&gt; classIsRecord(Class&lt;?&gt; class___) {\r\n  return class___.isRecord()\r\n          ? Optional.of(internalClassIsRecord((Class&lt;Record&gt;) class___))\r\n          : Optional.empty();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nJava records only provide shallow immutability. To detect deep immutability, the record must be recursively validated. The recursion occurs with the call to `classIs(recordComponent.getType())` (defined further down) in the function `internalClassIsRecord`.\r\n\r\n**Via [JCIP Annotation][6] or Marker Interfaces:**\r\n```java\r\npublic interface Immutable {}\r\npublic interface ImmutableEffective {\r\n  boolean isIrreversiblyImmutable();\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static Optional&lt;ImmutabilityType&gt; classIsJcipAnnotationOrImmutableInterface(Class&lt;?&gt; class___) {\r\n  return class___.isAnnotationPresent(net.jcip.annotations.Immutable.class) || Immutable.class.isAssignableFrom(class___)\r\n          ? Optional.of(ImmutabilityType.BEFORE_END_OF_CLASS_CONSTRUCTOR)\r\n          : Optional.empty();\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static Optional&lt;ImmutabilityType&gt; classIsImmutableEffective(Class&lt;?&gt; class___) {\r\n  return ImmutableEffective.class.isAssignableFrom(class___)\r\n          ? Optional.of(ImmutabilityType.PROPERTY_IRREVERSIBLY_IMMUTABLE)\r\n          : Optional.empty();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing everything defined above, it&#39;s time to implement the two target functions.\r\n\r\n**Class-oriented `classIs` function:**\r\n```java\r\npublic static ImmutabilityType classIs(Class&lt;?&gt; class___) {\r\n  return class___.isArray()\r\n      ? ImmutabilityType.UNDEFINED //java.lang.Array is always mutable\r\n      : classIsJavaConstant(class___)\r\n          .or(() -&gt; classIsRecord(class___))\r\n          .or(() -&gt; classIsJcipAnnotationOrImmutableInterface(class___))\r\n          .or(() -&gt; classIsImmutableEffective(class___))\r\n          .orElse(ImmutabilityType.UNDEFINED);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Instance-oriented `instanceIs` function:**\r\n```java\r\nprivate static boolean internalIsRecordHasAtLeastOneIrreversiblyImmutableStillUnset(Record record) throws InvocationTargetException, IllegalAccessException {\r\n  boolean result = false;

It is predicated on a spectrum of anticipated trust. To the degree one has control of one's environment correlates strongly to the degree the trust of any detected immutability. This trust continuum has been <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretization\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">discretized</a> into the Java <code>enum</code>, <code>ImmutabilityType</code>, below. The <code>enum</code> enables client code to decide upon what level of trust it would prefer to rely.</p>\n<p>While it would be highly desirable to a large number of software engineers, Java does not provide compile-time enforced immutability detection. As an analog to Rust's beautiful memory management solution to C/C++'s undesirable memory utilization potholes, it would be a huge leap forward if/when Java acquired compile-time enforced immutability detection. However, this doesn't currently appear on any known Java roadmaps (as of 2023/Jan).</p>\n<p><strong>Distinction 2:</strong></p>\n<p>The use of the word &quot;calcification&quot; will describe the process of an instance moving from a mutable (writable or fluid) to an irreversibly immutable (read-only or calcified) state.</p>\n<p>Every instantiation of a class involves a period of time where the instance is mutable. IOW, the default state of an instance, upon creation, is mutability. This means it is the responsibility of the class designer to decide if, and then when, the class becomes irreversibly immutable. If desiring immutability, this actually simplifies to deciding whether the instance remains mutable past the end of the execution of its constructor.</p>\n<p><strong>Distinction 3:</strong></p>\n<p>Because immutability is about permanently calcifying the state of an instance of a class, it is important to distinguish at run-time BY WHEN the state has become irreversibly immutable.</p>\n<p>The archetype, or ideal, for implementing immutability is to design the state to be calcified by the end of the execution of the class's constructor for a given instance. However, there are contexts where it is required to delay the calcification until sometime after the constructor completes execution. Whether this is due to poor design choices is outside the scope of this response, as the use cases exist and must be addressed.</p>\n<p><strong>Distinction 4:</strong></p>\n<p>Due to the implications of the last distinction, detecting immutability must be done at each of the class and the instance levels. The description of class level immutability applies to all instance of that class. The description of instance level immutability applies to some subset of instances from their parent class.</p>\n<p>As such, defining two different functions is needed for detecting immutability. One which takes a <code>Class&lt;?&gt;</code> as a parameter and returns the class level of immutability. And another which takes an <code>Object</code> instance as a parameter returns the instance-level of immutability at that point during runtime.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2><strong>Working on the problem space</strong></h2>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public enum ImmutabilityType {\n  UNDEFINED,    //unable to assert any trustable degree of deep immutability\n  PROPERTY_IRREVERSIBLY_IMMUTABLE, //trusting a post-instantiation window of mutability requiring an ImmutableEffective.isIrreversiblyImmutable() style of check\n  BEFORE_END_OF_CLASS_CONSTRUCTOR,  //trusting the implementor to properly enforce the Immutable contract, see Immutable interface Javadoc\n  JAVA_CONSTANT //trusting the Java compiler and platform\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This Java <code>enum</code> describes the kinds of immutability detected.</p>\n<p>The JavaDoc for the &quot;immutability contract&quot; referenced by the comment following the <code>ImmutabilityType.BEFORE_END_OF_CLASS_CONSTRUCTOR</code> enum instance is located <a href=\"https://jcip.net/annotations/doc/net/jcip/annotations/Immutable.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Two Target Functions:</strong></p>\n<p>Using the <code>ImmutabilityType</code> enum as their return type, the two target functions are defined below.
