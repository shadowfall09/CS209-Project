But is it non-blocking?\r\n\r\nOne which is true about CompletableFuture is that it is truly async, it allows you to run your task asynchronously from the caller thread and the API such as `thenXXX` allows you to process the result when it becomes available. On the other hand, `CompletableFuture` is not always non-blocking. For example, when you run the following code, it will be executed asynchronously on the default `ForkJoinPool`: \r\n\r\n\r\n    CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -&gt; {\r\n        try {\r\n            Thread.sleep(1000);\r\n        }\r\n        catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        return 1;\r\n    });\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the `Thread` in `ForkJoinPool` that executes the task will be blocked eventually which means that we can&#39;t guarantee that the call will be non-blocking.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, `CompletableFuture` exposes API which allows you to make it truly non-blocking.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can always do the following: \r\n\r\n    public CompletableFuture myNonBlockingHttpCall(Object someData) {\r\n        var uncompletedFuture = new CompletableFuture(); // creates uncompleted future\r\n        \r\n        myAsyncHttpClient.execute(someData, (result, exception -&gt; {\r\n            if(exception != null) {\r\n                uncompletedFuture.completeExceptionally(exception);\r\n                return;\r\n            }\r\n            uncompletedFuture.complete(result);\r\n        })\r\n        \r\n        return uncompletedFuture;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the API of `CompletableFuture` future provides you with the `complete` and `completeExceptionally` methods that complete your execution whenever it is needed without blocking any thread.\r\n\r\n# Mono vs CompletableFuture\r\n\r\nIn the previous section, we got an overview of CF behavior, but what is the central difference between CompletableFuture and Mono? \r\n\r\nIt worth to mention that we can do blocking Mono as well. No one prevents us from writing the following:\r\n\r\n    Mono.fromCallable(() -&gt; {\r\n        try {\r\n            Thread.sleep(1000);\r\n        }\r\n        catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        return 1;\r\n    })\r\n\r\nOf course, once we subscribe to the future, the caller thread will be blocked. But we can always work around that by providing an additional `subscribeOn` operator. Nevertheless, the broader API of `Mono` is not the key feature.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the main difference between `CompletableFuture` and `Mono`, lets back to previously mentioned `myNonBlockingHttpCall` method implementation.\r\n\r\n    public CompletableFuture myUpperLevelBusinessLogic() {\r\n        var future = myNonBlockingHttpCall();\r\n        \r\n        // ... some code\r\n        \r\n        if (something) {\r\n           // oh we don&#39;t really need anything, let&#39;s just throw an exception\r\n           var errorFuture = new CompletableFuture();\r\n           errorFuture.completeExceptionally(new RuntimeException());\r\n    \r\n           return errorFuture;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n       return future;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the case of `CompletableFuture`, once the method is called, it will eagerly execute HTTP call to another service/resource. Even though we will not really need the result of the execution after verifying some pre/post conditions, it starts the execution, and additional CPU/DB-Connections/What-Ever-Machine-Resources will be allocated for this work.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the `Mono` type is lazy by definition:\r\n\r\n    public Mono myNonBlockingHttpCallWithMono(Object someData) {\r\n        return Mono.create(sink -&gt; {\r\n                myAsyncHttpClient.execute(someData, (result, exception -&gt; {\r\n                    if(exception != null) {\r\n                        sink.error(exception);\r\n                        return;\r\n                    }\r\n                    sink.success(result);\r\n                })\r\n        });\r\n    } \r\n\r\n    public Mono myUpperLevelBusinessLogic() {\r\n        var mono = myNonBlockingHttpCallWithMono();\r\n        \r\n        // ... some code\r\n        \r\n        if (something) {\r\n           // oh we don&#39;t really need anything, let&#39;s just throw an exception\r\n\r\n           return Mono.error(new RuntimeException());\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n       return mono;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn this case, nothing will happen until the final `mono` is subscribed. Thus, only when `Mono` returned by the `myNonBlockingHttpCallWithMono` method, will be subscribed, the logic provided to `Mono.create(Consumer)` will be executed.\r\n\r\nAnd we can go even further. We can make our execution much lazier. As you might know, `Mono` extends `Publisher` from the Reactive Streams specification. The screaming feature of Reactive Streams is backpressure support. Thus, using the `Mono` API we can do execution only when the data is really needed, and our subscriber is ready to consume them:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mono.create(sink -&gt; {\r\n        AtomicBoolean once = new AtomicBoolean();\r\n        sink.onRequest(__ -&gt; {\r\n            if(!once.get() &amp;&amp; once.compareAndSet(false, true) {\r\n                myAsyncHttpClient.execute(someData, (result, exception -&gt; {\r\n                    if(exception != null) {\r\n                        sink.error(exception);\r\n                        return;\r\n                    }\r\n                    sink.success(result);\r\n                });\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n\r\nIn this example, we execute data only when subscriber called `Subscription#request` so by doing that it declared its readiness to receive data.\r\n\r\n# Summary \r\n\r\n - `CompletableFuture` is async and can be non-blocking\r\n - `CompletableFuture` is eager. You can&#39;t postpone the execution. But you can cancel them (which is better than nothing)\r\n - `Mono` is async/non-blocking and can easily execute any call on different `Thread` by composing the main `Mono` with different operators.\r\n - `Mono` is truly lazy and allows postponing execution startup by the subscriber presence and its readiness to consume data.","title":"Mono vs CompletableFuture","body":"<h1>CompletableFuture is Async.

If the VM supports inlining, you might even end up converting an optimized stack frame into <em>several</em> unoptimized stack frames.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4262789,"reputation":4632,"user_id":3486720,"accept_rate":36,"display_name":"Apurva Singh"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1685490973,"creation_date":1685490391,"answer_id":76369271,"question_id":9105505,"body_markdown":"JIT is just.. looks for number of method invocations, and if it crosses a threshold, (-XX:CompileThreshold=&lt;number&gt;) it compiles (to machine code/ native) and caches the method.

Consider the following example, can you tell which field is which just by reading code?</p>\n\n<pre><code>Person.builder(\"John\", \"Michael\", 16, 1987) // which is name, which is surname? what is 16?\n    .year(1982) // if this is year of birth, then what is 1987 above?\n    .build()\n</code></pre>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":21865,"reputation":13914,"user_id":53481,"accept_rate":82,"display_name":"okutane"},"score":21,"creation_date":1495551534,"post_id":41162327,"comment_id":75295177,"body_markdown":"That&#39;s what I want to be generated by lombok for me.","body":"That&#39;s what I want to be generated by lombok for me."},{"owner":{"account_id":41219,"reputation":3237,"user_id":119741,"accept_rate":64,"display_name":"Nick"},"score":0,"creation_date":1597525361,"post_id":41162327,"comment_id":112163064,"body_markdown":"@okutane Sounds like its not happening: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/project-lombok/gjUAHljdSK0/CdizSESdEAAJ","body":"@okutane Sounds like its not happening: <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/project-lombok/gjUAHljdSK0/CdizSESdEAAJ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">groups.google.com/d/msg/project-lombok/gjUAHljdSK0/CdizSESdE&zwnj;&#8203;AAJ</a>"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1601812,"reputation":1854,"user_id":1482700,"accept_rate":72,"display_name":"kozla13"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":9,"is_accepted":false,"score":8,"last_activity_date":1481799069,"creation_date":1481799069,"answer_id":41162327,"question_id":29885428,"body_markdown":"This is my solution for the problem\r\n\r\n    import lombok.Builder;\r\n    import lombok.Data;\r\n    import lombok.NonNull;\r\n    \r\n    @Data\r\n    @Builder(builderMethodName = &quot;privateBuilder&quot;)\r\n    public class Person {\r\n        @NonNull\r\n        private String name;\r\n        @NonNull\r\n        private String surname;\r\n        private int age;//optional\r\n\r\n    public static Url safeBuilder() {\r\n        return new Builder();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    interface Url {\r\n        Surname name(String name);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    interface Surname {\r\n        Build surname(String surname);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    interface Build {\r\n        Build age(int age);\r\n        Person build();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static class Builder implements Url, Surname, Build {\r\n        PersonBuilder pb = Person.privateBuilder();\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public Surname name(String name) {\r\n            pb.name(name);\r\n            return this;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public Build surname(String surname) {\r\n            pb.surname(surname);\r\n            return this;\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public Build age(int age) {\r\n            pb.age(age);\r\n            return this;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public Person build() {\r\n            return pb.build();\r\n        }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\ninspired by this blog post:\r\n\r\nhttps://blog.jayway.com/2012/02/07/builder-pattern-with-a-twist/","title":"Required arguments with a Lombok @Builder","body":"<p>This is my solution for the problem</p>\n\n<pre><code>import lombok.Builder;\nimport lombok.Data;\nimport lombok.NonNull;\n\n@Data\n@Builder(builderMethodName = \"privateBuilder\")\npublic class Person {\n    @NonNull\n    private String name;\n    @NonNull\n    private String surname;\n    private int age;//optional\n\npublic static Url safeBuilder() {\n    return new Builder();\n}\n\ninterface Url {\n    Surname name(String name);\n}\n\ninterface Surname {\n    Build surname(String surname);\n}\n\ninterface Build {\n    Build age(int age);\n    Person build();\n}\n\npublic static class Builder implements Url, Surname, Build {\n    PersonBuilder pb = Person.privateBuilder();\n\n    @Override\n    public Surname name(String name) {\n        pb.name(name);\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Build surname(String surname) {\n        pb.surname(surname);\n        return this;\n\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Build age(int age) {\n        pb.age(age);\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Person build() {\n        return pb.build();\n    }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>inspired by this blog post:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.jayway.com/2012/02/07/builder-pattern-with-a-twist/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://blog.jayway.com/2012/02/07/builder-pattern-with-a-twist/</a></p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1507058,"reputation":2933,"user_id":1410212,"accept_rate":88,"display_name":"lilalinux"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":18,"is_accepted":false,"score":18,"last_activity_date":1579825246,"creation_date":1519986653,"answer_id":49067307,"question_id":29885428,"body_markdown":"The simpliest solution is to add a `@lombok.NonNull` to all mandatory values.

If you use someone else's domain name, you risk a package naming conflict.</p>\n<p>The relevant portions of the JLS:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Programmers should take steps to avoid the possibility of two published packages having the same name by choosing unique package names for packages that are widely distributed. This allows packages to be easily and automatically installed and catalogued. This section specifies a suggested convention for generating such unique package names. […]</em></p>\n<p><em>If unique package names are not used, then package name conflicts may arise far from the point of creation of either of the conflicting packages. This may create a situation that is difficult or impossible for the user or programmer to resolve. […]</em></p>\n<p><em>You form a unique package name by first having (or belonging to an organization that has) an Internet domain name, such as <code>oracle.com</code>. You then reverse this name, component by component, to obtain, in this example, <code>com.oracle</code>, and use this as a prefix for your package names, using a convention developed within your organization to further administer package names. […]</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":20630,"reputation":140565,"user_id":49485,"accept_rate":72,"display_name":"Sophie Alpert"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1926,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":2035960,"answer_count":5,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1685481000,"creation_date":1263091674,"question_id":2035896,"body_markdown":"I just started looking at the new FIRST Robotics Java SDK, which includes project generators to build sample robotics programs.\r\n\r\nSomething I was curious about is the file it generates begins with:\r\n\r\n    package edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.templates;\r\n\r\nDoes this actually make sense?

If you call `setContentView(R.layout.activity_layout)` again (like in your &#39;back&#39; function) then *it inflates a new set of `View` objects*. The `Button` with the `button5` ID **won&#39;t have a click listener set on it** until you set it up again, because it&#39;s a completely new object.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nYou have two options here. You can manually inflate each view hierarchy and store them (like you&#39;re doing with `R.layout.custome_layout` in `onCreate`) and then call `setContentView(view1)` etc, i.e. passing *a set of `Views` for display*. That way, since you&#39;re using the same objects, any click listeners will still be set.\r\n\r\nThe other option is to do what you&#39;re doing, and call `setContentView(R.layout.activity_layout)`, but run your setup code (adding click listeners etc) every time you call it - you&#39;re inflating new objects, so you need to set them up every time. The easiest way to do that would be creating a method like `showMainLayout()` that has the `setContentView` and `setOnClickListener` code, and call that when you want to display that layout.\r\n\r\nOr you could use `Fragment`s and just swap between those - this kind of thing is a big part of what they&#39;re for.","title":"&quot;setOnClickListener&quot; methode doesn&#39;t work on custom layout file set by &quot;setContentView&quot;","body":"<p>You're inflating a layout (<code>custome_layout.xml</code>) and setting a click listener on its <code>TextView</code>, but you're not actually displaying that inflated layout - so the user can't click on it!</p>\n<p>I'm guessing you actually want to set the click listener on the <code>Button</code> in <code>activity_layout</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    // inflate and display the main activity layout\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_layout);\n\n    // find the button on the displayed layout\n    Button button = findViewById(R.id.button5);\n    \n    // set a click listener on it\n    button.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {\n        @Override\n        public void onClick(View view) {\n            // call openNewLayout or whatever\n        }\n    };\n}\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<p>A problem here is you're using <code>setContentView</code> with layout resource IDs, like <code>setContentView(R.layout.activity_layout)</code>.

You can use an existing DTO but you need to make sure that the no fields are mandatory since then you break the &quot;partial&quot; thingy.. e.g PatchUserDTO.class\r\n\r\n 3.

You find the entity by id provided in the path.\r\n 5. You map the fields from the dto to the existing entity.( You can use ModelMapper or just provide helper methods )\r\n\r\n 6.
