There are several frameworks out there which will help you with this and as you are new to programming there are a lot of things you could change/do better. But I will ignore these things.\r\n\r\nI think your are trying to check if one 5x5 bullet intersects with another 5x5 bullet.\r\n\r\nTo make it easy let us asume your **bullets are squares**:\r\n\r\nIn your hitByBullet you should check your square centers (i asume that are x,y of your bullets) distance in both dimensions:\r\n\r\nSth. like this should check the collision:\r\n\r\n\r\n    if(Math.abs(bullets.get(i).getY() - bulletsEnemy.get(j).getY()) &lt; 5 &amp;&amp; \r\n        Math.abs(bullets.get(i).getX() - bulletsEnemy.get(j).getX()) &lt; 5) { \r\n           return i;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nDepending of the size of your bullets you need to change the distance check ( &lt;=5).

From my understanding, you generate a keystore with the <code>keytool</code> command and that generates a keystore file that is like a small database(?) that contains a self-signed certificate and a public/private key pair. We then create a truststore that's like a keystore but where we only import the self-signed certificate and the public key and this is what the client uses to connect to the server (I don't really understand this very last part).</p>\n<p>How do we actually use these keys that we generated inside our code?

## ECJ separated from JDT Core\r\n&gt; \t\r\n&gt; Historically the code for ECJ was always in the same `org.eclipse.jdt.core` project that also contained the code for the Java support in the IDE, just in a different source folder. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; The well known standalone ECJ compiler library that could be used outside of Eclipse (for compilation with external tooling) was generated out of this core bundle at build time and was not included in the default SDK (because it contained subset of packages and classes provided by `org.eclipse.jdt.core`).\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; This lead to few issues, with both Eclipse / standalone use of the ECJ compiler. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; - The (non-JDT) code inside Eclipse that required &quot;default&quot; `javax.tools.JavaCompiler` API implementation and had no need for full JDT / workspace support was not able to use `org.eclipse.jdt.core` without pulling in `org.eclipse.core.resources` bundle and so the dependency to the workspace. \r\n&gt; - Another interesting side effect of hosting ECJ code next to IDE code inside same `org.eclipse.jdt.core` bundle was that developers couldn&#39;t see if the ECJ code per mistake got some dependency to the IDE.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; To resolve these (and other) problems, **the ECJ code is moved from org.eclipse.jdt.core to dedicated `org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.batch` project** and will be deployed as a separated bundle.  \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; The `org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.batch` is now included in SDK as a regular Eclipse bundle and can be compiled / deployed / used separately from `org.eclipse.jdt.core bundle`. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; All of ECJ packages are re-exported by `org.eclipse.jdt.core`, therefore from OSGI point of view, all 3rd party code that used some compiler related API from `org.eclipse.jdt.core` doesn&#39;t require any change.  \r\nThe `org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.batch` bundle itself doesn&#39;t have any dependencies and so can be used in Eclipse products that do not use workspace concepts.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; However, no change is without side effects.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; ### Known problems with the split of the ECJ from core bundle\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; - As part of the `org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.batch` code separation from `org.eclipse.jdt.core`, the two fragments of `org.eclipse.jdt.core` - `org.eclipse.jdt.compiler.apt` and `org.eclipse.jdt.compiler.tool` were merged into `org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.batch`.  \r\nSo if some target definition, launch configuration or build file referenced the two fragments, these references can and should be removed now.\r\n&gt; - Another issue might affect standalone (non OSGI based) applications that were using `org.eclipse.jdt.core` as a &quot;simple&quot; Java library (which `jdt.core` never was).  \r\nSo for example code that had `org.eclipse.jdt.core_XYZ.jar` on classpath and tried to call this outside Eclipse:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;       ASTParser parser = ASTParser.newParser(AST.getJLSLatest());\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;   would fail now with:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;       NoClassDefFoundError: org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.env.ICompilationUnit\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;   because `org.eclipse.jdt.core.dom.ASTParser` uses internally ECJ APIs and they are now ... surprise ... moved to `org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.batch` jar.  \r\n  To fix this error, `org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler.batch` library should be added to the application classpath.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.27/jdt.php#ecj-separated-from-core","title":"Is the standalone ecj (Eclipse Java Compiler) package no longer maintained?","body":"<p>That will change with <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.27/jdt.php#ecj-separated-from-core\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eclipse 4.27 (2023-03 release)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>ECJ separated from JDT Core</h2>\n<p>Historically the code for ECJ was always in the same <code>org.eclipse.jdt.core</code> project that also contained the code for the Java support in the IDE, just in a different source folder.</p>\n<p>The well known standalone ECJ compiler library that could be used outside of Eclipse (for compilation with external tooling) was generated out of this core bundle at build time and was not included in the default SDK (because it contained subset of packages and classes provided by <code>org.eclipse.jdt.core</code>).</p>\n<p>This lead to few issues, with both Eclipse / standalone use of the ECJ compiler.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The (non-JDT) code inside Eclipse that required &quot;default&quot;

Disassembling the latter, the anonymous inner class,\r\nwith `javap -c` yields:\r\n\r\n    Compiled from &quot;Outer.java&quot;\r\n    class Outer$1 extends java.lang.Object implements java.lang.Runnable{\r\n    final Outer this$0;\r\n\r\n    Outer$1(Outer);\r\n      Code:\r\n       0:   aload_0\r\n       1:   aload_1\r\n       2:   putfield        #1; //Field this$0:LOuter;\r\n       5:   aload_0\r\n       6:   invokespecial   #2; //Method java/lang/Object.&quot;&lt;init&gt;&quot;:()V\r\n       9:   return\r\n\r\n    public void run();\r\n      Code:\r\n       0:   getstatic       #3; //Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;\r\n       3:   ldc     #4; //String hello\r\n       5:   invokevirtual   #5; //Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V\r\n       8:   return\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe `putfield` line shows that a reference to the enclosing instance is\r\nbeing stored in the field `this$0` (of type `Outer`) by the constructor\r\neven though this field is never used again.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunate if you&#39;re attempting to create small potentially\r\nlong-lived objects with anonymous inner classes as they&#39;ll hold onto the\r\n(potentially large) enclosing instance. A workaround is to use an instance of a static class (or a top-level class) instead.

See below code.\r\n\r\n     public class Main{\r\n    \tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    \t\tSystem.out.println(add(1,2));;\r\n    \t\tSystem.out.println(add(1,2,3));\r\n    \t}\r\n    \tpublic static int add(int a,int b){\r\n    \t    return a+b;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \tpublic static int add(int a,int b,int c){\r\n    \t    return a+b+c;\r\n    \t} \t\r\n    }\r\n\r\nPython code:\r\n\r\n    class TestPolymorphism:\r\n        def add(self,a,b):\r\n            return (a+b)\r\n        def add(self,a,b,c):\r\n            return (a+b+c)\r\n    \r\n    obj = TestPolymorphism()\r\n    print(obj.add(1,2)) #will get an error\r\n    print(obj.add(1,2,3))\r\n\r\nThe same method overloading works in java but not in python. Why there is difference?. If I want it to work then I have to change my python code as below:\r\n\r\n    class TestPolymorphism:\r\n        def add(self,a,b,c=None):\r\n            if c ==None:\r\n                sum  = a+b\r\n                return sum\r\n            else:\r\n                sum = a+b+c\r\n                return sum\r\n    \r\n    obj = TestPolymorphism()\r\n    print(obj.add(1,2))\r\n    print(obj.add(1,2,3))\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not getting convinced that above the code is an example of Polymorphism.
