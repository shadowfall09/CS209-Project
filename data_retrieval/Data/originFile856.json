have defined a property `custom.property=Some Environment specific Value` inside all the `application.properties` file\r\n\r\nFollowing are my application.properties file\r\n\r\n```\r\napplication.properties\r\napplication-local.properties\r\napplication-dev.properties\r\n```\r\n\r\nInside application.properties file I have set only one property which is as follows\r\n\r\n```\r\nspring.profiles.active=@activatedProperties@\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe property `custom.property=Some Environment Specific Value` is defined inside remaining .properties files which are `application-local.properties` and `application-dev.properties`\r\n\r\nI have created a controller which is as follows\r\n\r\n```\r\n@RestController\r\npublic class TestController {\r\n\r\n    @Value(&quot;${custom.property}&quot;)\r\n    private String activeProfile;\r\n\r\n    @GetMapping(&quot;/testing&quot;)\r\n    public ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; getTestMEthod() {\r\n\r\n        String message = activeProfile + &quot;says hello&quot;;\r\n        return ResponseEntity.ok().body(message);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow when I run my application from intellij, the application starts alright and the controller also sends an appropriate response by picking values from .properties file\r\n\r\nbut when I run my application from command line using following command\r\n\r\n`java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=local target\\myapp-standalone-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar`\r\n\r\nThe application doesn&#39;t start at all and instead I get the following error\r\n\r\n```\r\n15:02:49.234

So I have the following classes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@MappedSuperClass\r\npublic abstract class MySuperList {\r\n...\r\n\r\n   @OneToMany(... fetch = fetchType.LAZY)\r\n   private Set&lt;Attributes&gt; myAttributes;\r\n\r\n   @OneToMany(... fetch = fetchType.LAZY)\r\n   private Set&lt;Tag&gt; myTags;\r\n\r\n...\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class MyList extends MySuperList{\r\n...\r\n\r\n   @OneToMany(... fetch = fetchType.LAZY)\r\n   private Set&lt;MetadataItems&gt; myMetadataItems;\r\n\r\n...\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nWhen I load several of these items using a similar code below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCriteriaBuilder cb = entityManager.getCriteriaBuilder();\r\nCriteriaQuery&lt;MyList&gt; cq = cb.createQuery(MyList.class);\r\nRoot&lt;MyList&gt; myList = cq.from(MyList.class);\r\ncq.select(myList).distinct(true).where(buildPredicate()).orderBy(buildOrder());\r\nList&lt;MyList&gt; result = cb.createQuery(cq).setFirstResult(1).setMaxResult(50).setHint(QueryHints.PASS_DISTINCT_THROUGH, false).getResultList();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I see 151 calls to the database: \r\n- One to get the MyList records - 50 records are returned. \r\n- 50 calls to load the Attributes for the 50 MyList records returned. \r\n- 50 calls to load the Tags for the 50 MyList records returned. \r\n- 50 calls to load the MetadataItems for the 50 MyList records returned.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a normal n+1 issue. It is quite slow so I decide to eagerly load using the fetch operation prior to the get result list:\r\n```\r\nmyList.fetch(&quot;myAttributes&quot;, JoinType.LEFT)\r\nmyList.fetch(&quot;myTags&quot;, JoinType.LEFT)\r\nmyList.fetch(&quot;myMetadataItems&quot;, JoinType.LEFT)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis then does a Cartesian product and returns everything in the SQL call and loads all entities and the child entities. This is slightly faster to the n+1 calls but is still slow.\r\n\r\nThe SQL itself, when run manually, is fast.\r\n\r\nSo I think what if I load each of the children manually (I&#39;ve tried both JPA query and native query) i.e. I don&#39;t `fetch` the children but I build 3 separate &quot;criteria builders&quot; that load the Attribute, Tag, MyMetadataItem using the MyList ids returned using the IN operator. So something like this:\r\n- SELECT * FROM Attribute WHERE MyListId IN ( &lt;the 50 MyListIds&gt; ) \r\n- SELECT * FROM Tag WHERE MyListId IN ( &lt;the 50 MyListIds&gt; )\r\n- SELECT * FROM MyMetadataItem WHERE MyListId IN ( &lt;the 50 MyListIds&gt; )\r\n\r\nSo I find the initial load of MyList quite speedy and so is the loading of the Attribute, Tag and MyMetadataItem...\r\n\r\n*but* unfortunately when I access a MyList record then once again it lazy loads the Attribute, Tag and MyMetadataItem. I was hoping that if I load the children entities manually that it would be in the Hibernate context and would magically link the MyList record to the children records (and vice versa).\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve even tried to manually &quot;link&quot; it. I.e. I loop through the MyList and call setMyAttribute() with the Attribute records returned that are specific to the MyList record but unfortunately still the same issue.\r\n\r\nSo I guess my questions is:\r\n1. When we have a n+1 issue then I guess the best thing to do is eagerly load the children?\r\n2. If I load children items manually then is there a way to link it to the parent somehow?\r\n3. Is the above approach even right! :) or is there a better way to speed things up? \r\n\r\nJava 1.8\r\nHibernate 5.4.15\r\nOracle database. ojdbc 18.3\r\n\r\nAny words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n  ","title":"Speeding up a n+1 hibernate/jpa query where the sql call is fast but loading is slow","body":"<p>I have a performance issue when I'm loading entities that I'm looking at how to speed up.

However, you can use flows to combine the two async calls and run them at the same time (faster than running them one-at-a-time and easier to deal with the results)\r\n\r\nFirst, make a helper function to return a flow for each call to `queryProductDetails` (this requires the billing `-ktx` extension in gradle)\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nprivate fun getDetailsFlow(productIds: List&lt;String&gt;, type: String) : Flow&lt;List&lt;ProductDetails&gt;&gt; {\r\n\r\n\tval productList = productIds.map { productId -&gt;\r\n\t\tQueryProductDetailsParams.Product.newBuilder()\r\n\t\t\t.setProductId(productId)\r\n\t\t\t.setProductType(type)\r\n\t\t\t.build()\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tval params = QueryProductDetailsParams.newBuilder().setProductList(productList).build()\r\n\r\n\treturn flow {\r\n\t\temit(billingClient?.queryProductDetails(params))\r\n\t}.map { result -&gt;\r\n\t\tresult?.productDetailsList ?: emptyList()\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen zip together two flows to get a single list of products as a result.\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nfun queryProductDetails() {\r\n\r\n\tval inAppFlow = getDetailsFlow(listOf(Product.GOLD, Product.SILVER), BillingClient.ProductType.INAPP)\r\n\tval subsFlow = getDetailsFlow(listOf(Product.UNLIMITED), BillingClient.ProductType.SUBS)\r\n\r\n\tval allDetailsFlow = inAppFlow.zip(subsFlow) { inAppResult, subsResult -&gt;\r\n\t\treturn@zip inAppResult + subsResult\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tscope.launch {\r\n\t\tallDetailsFlow.collect { productList -&gt;\r\n\t\t\t// handle the unified list of all products, subscription and in-app\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```","title":"Adding multiple products to productlist for queryProductDetailsAsync in android billing 5.0.0","body":"<p>You don't actually have to use an <code>ImmutableList</code>.

You&#39;ve defined `customersModels` as a `List`, which in Kotlin is **explicitly immutable**. [You can&#39;t `add` things to it.][1]\r\n\r\n&gt; Methods in this interface support only read-only access to the list; read/write access is supported through the `MutableList` interface.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;re assigning an `ArrayList` to that variable, which is an object that *does* have the `add` method. And an `ArrayList` `is` a `List`, so you can do that. Like how a pencil *is* a writing tool that&#39;s erasable, if someone just needs something to write with, you can give them a pencil or a pen. All they&#39;ve asked for is something that writes. \r\n\r\nBut the variable you&#39;re interacting with, `customersModels`, is explicitly a reference to a Kotlin `List` - a more restrictive subtype of `MutableList`*. It knows nothing about what that object *actually is*, just that it fits the immutable `List` type. That type **does not have an `add` method** so you can&#39;t call it. Same as how if you ask for a writing tool, you can&#39;t assume you&#39;ll be able to erase what you write.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSo you have three options here (let&#39;s not get into reflection):\r\n\r\nYou can *cast* that variable to another type:\r\n\r\n````\r\n// or &#39;as ArrayList&#39; if you really need to be that specific for some reason - you probably don&#39;t\r\n(customersModels as MutableList).add(thing)\r\n````\r\n\r\nThis is an *unchecked cast* - you&#39;re telling the compiler *&quot;hey I know what this is, you don&#39;t but you&#39;re just gonna have to trust me on this one&quot;*. This is unsafe, because there&#39;s no protection, the compiler can&#39;t do any checking and force you to handle potential problems. (Don&#39;t do this)\r\n\r\nA better approach is to actually check as you cast - there are two ways to do this in Kotlin:\r\n\r\n````\r\n// confirm the object&#39;s type - this will result in a &#39;smart cast&#39; because the compiler\r\n// can see that you&#39;re handling it safely, so it basically allows you to treat\r\n// myList as that type\r\nif (myList is MutableList) myList.add(thing)\r\n\r\n// same deal but you can cast with a null fallback if it fails, then null-check the result\r\n(myList as? MutableList)?.add(thing)\r\n````\r\n\r\nThis is good for things where you handle a more general type, but you might want to get specific and handle different member types in different ways. Especially common if you&#39;re using sealed classes.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe last approach is to just use the appropriate type in the first place!\r\n\r\n````\r\n// MutableList, since you want to mutate it by adding stuff\r\nvar customersModels: MutableList&lt;CustomersModel&gt; = ArrayList()\r\ncustomersModels.add(null)\r\n````\r\n\r\nYou&#39;re creating a list you want to change - so that&#39;s a `MutableList`, and that&#39;s what `customersModels` should be. This kind of thing can be internal - you can expose that list as a `List` rather than a `MutableList`, so that other stuff that uses it sees it as a fixed, immutable list. If you&#39;ve used `LiveData` you&#39;ve probably seen this approach:\r\n\r\n````\r\nprivate val _myData = MutableLiveData&lt;String&gt;(&quot;hi&quot;)\r\nval myData: LiveData&lt;String&gt; = _myData\r\n````\r\n\r\n`myData` is literally pointing at that `MutableLiveData` object, but because its type is just `LiveData` (the immutable kind) that means stuff that accesses that public variable see an object they can&#39;t change. Really they could cast it to `MutableLiveData` and mess with it, but it&#39;s less a security feature and more of an organisational thing. Make it clear how stuff is meant to be used, how you interact with it, etc. If you want to update, go through a specific function, that kind of thing.\r\n\r\nSo use `List` if it&#39;s just a list that&#39;s meant to be read, not written to. If it will/might be changed, use the `MutableList` type. This makes it clearer about what&#39;s going on.\r\n\r\nAlso, generally you shouldn&#39;t use explicit types like `ArrayList` - Kotlin has a bunch of functions to generate `List`s and `MutableList`s, which makes it easier to reason about what you&#39;re doing and why:\r\n\r\n````\r\nval numbers = List(5) { it + 1 }\r\nval greetings = mutableListOf(&quot;hi&quot;, &quot;hey&quot;, &quot;sup&quot;)\r\n````\r\n\r\nNotice I&#39;m not specifying the type next to the variable, it&#39;s getting inferred by the function I&#39;m using.

It will get you started very quickly, and hopefully (if you follow conventions) handle all of your peripheral needs.\r\n - [Spring Roo][4] is a very-fast-to-work-with framework, but it might get hard to maintain and extend later on.\r\n\r\nThese two are full web frameworks, that is, they handle database, MVC (presentation layer), configuration setting, etc... (I&#39;ll explain shortly). And could even ease your deployment process.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re going to go through any other route (using several frameworks together), you are probably not going to finish what you are doing in five months.\r\n\r\nTo understand why, and to clear some things you wrote in your question, you need to understand that modern web development (and enterprise development as a whole) is comprised of several different technologies:\r\n\r\n - Presentation: the term web frameworks has been more or less taken to mean frameworks that deal with this side of web development, i.e., how to create a web page (an HTML page). Most of the frameworks offer an MVC like approach (which you can read about elsewhere), and this is what most of the frameworks/technologies you gave sit in&amp;mdash;[JSP][5] and [Struts][6] (which uses JSP) are examples of web frameworks.
