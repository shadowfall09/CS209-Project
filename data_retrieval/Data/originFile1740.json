I would be very happy if those who have knowledge can review and give information about the problem.</p>\n<p>GameView.java</p>\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>package com.woxiapps.hopbird;\n\nimport android.content.Context;\nimport android.graphics.Bitmap;\nimport android.graphics.BitmapFactory;\nimport android.graphics.Canvas;\nimport android.graphics.Color;\nimport android.os.Handler;\nimport android.util.AttributeSet;\nimport android.view.MotionEvent;\nimport android.view.View;\n\nimport androidx.annotation.Nullable;\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.logging.LogRecord;\n\npublic class GameView extends View {\n    private Bird bird;\n    private android.os.Handler handler;\n    private Runnable r;\n    private ArrayList&lt;Pipe&gt; arrPipes;\n    private int sumpipe, distance;\n\n\n    public GameView(Context context, @Nullable AttributeSet attrs) {\n        super(context, attrs);\n        initBird();\n        initPipe();\n        handler = new Handler();\n        r = new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                invalidate();\n            }\n        };\n    }\n\n    private void initPipe() {\n        sumpipe = 6;\n        distance = 300*Constants.SCREEN_HEIGHT/1920;\n        arrPipes = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; sumpipe/2; i++){\n            if (i &lt; sumpipe/2) {\n                this.arrPipes.add(new Pipe(Constants.SCREEN_WIDTH+i*((Constants.SCREEN_WIDTH+200*Constants.SCREEN_WIDTH/1080)/(sumpipe/2)),\n                        0,200*Constants.SCREEN_WIDTH/1080, Constants.SCREEN_WIDTH/2));\n                this.arrPipes.get(this.arrPipes.size()-1).setBm(BitmapFactory.decodeResource(this.getResources(),R.drawable.pipe2));\n                this.arrPipes.get(this.arrPipes.size()-1).randomY();\n            }else {\n                this.arrPipes.add(new Pipe(this.arrPipes.get(i-sumpipe/2).getX(),this.arrPipes.get(i-sumpipe/2).getY()\n                        +this.arrPipes.get(i-sumpipe/2).getHeight() + this.distance, 200*Constants.SCREEN_WIDTH/1080, Constants.SCREEN_HEIGHT/2));\n\n                this.arrPipes.get(this.arrPipes.size()-1).setBm(BitmapFactory.decodeResource(this.getResources(), R.drawable.pipe1));\n            }\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    private void initBird() {\n        bird = new Bird();\n        bird.setWidth(100*Constants.SCREEN_WIDTH/1080);\n        bird.setHeight(100*Constants.SCREEN_HEIGHT/1920);\n        bird.setX(100*Constants.SCREEN_WIDTH/1080);\n        bird.setY(Constants.SCREEN_HEIGHT/2-bird.getHeight()/2);\n        ArrayList&lt;Bitmap&gt; ArrBms = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n        ArrBms.add(BitmapFactory.decodeResource(this.getResources(),R.drawable.bird1));\n        ArrBms.add(BitmapFactory.decodeResource(this.getResources(),R.drawable.bird2));\n        bird.setArrBms(ArrBms);\n    }\n\n    public void draw(Canvas canvas){\n        super.draw(canvas);\n        bird.draw(canvas);\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; sumpipe; i++) {\n\n            if (this.arrPipes.get(i).getX() &lt; -arrPipes.get(i).getWidth()){\n                this.arrPipes.get(i).setX(Constants.SCREEN_WIDTH);\n                if(i &lt; sumpipe/2){\n                    arrPipes.get(i).randomY();\n                }else {\n                    arrPipes.get(i).setY(this.arrPipes.get(i-sumpipe/2).getY()\n                    +this.arrPipes.get(i-sumpipe/2).getHeight() + this.distance);\n                }\n            }\n            this.arrPipes.get(i).draw(canvas);\n        }\n\n        handler.postDelayed(r, 10);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) {\n        if (event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN) {\n            bird.setDrop(-15);\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n}</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HQmqj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">enter image description here</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["java","mongodb","mongodb-query","spring-data-mongodb"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":23650173,"reputation":21,"user_id":17742312,"display_name":"hoangn"},"score":0,"creation_date":1640196098,"post_id":70452862,"comment_id":124540429,"body_markdown":"@ray I want the actions property is always be updated to keep track.\nThank you, now I know Mongo playground!","body":"@ray I want the actions property is always be updated to keep track.

have tried to do in the graphical interface part so far, i got the images for the cards and thought of getting a start button that runs the main code of the game and when i do this, the game runs fine on console but the graphical interface freezes. I want to know if this is the right way or if there is another way to do it.\r\nAny help would be really appreciated.","title":"Graphical Interface on Java Swing not working properly","body":"<p>Help

what i have tried to do in the graphical interface part so far, i got the images for the cards and thought of getting a start button that runs the main code of the game and when i do this, the game runs fine on console but the graphical interface freezes. I want to know if this is the right way or if there is another way to do it.\nAny help would be really appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2818342,"reputation":299856,"user_id":2422776,"display_name":"Mureinik"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1640194215,"creation_date":1640194215,"answer_id":70452923,"question_id":70452870,"body_markdown":"You can&#39;t dynamically bind table names, only values, so you&#39;ll have to resort to string manipulation/concatenation to get the table name dynamically.

Even if you create a `Shape shape = new Shape()` object and call its method, it does not help us at all.\r\n\r\nInstead it provides us with a method that each subclass has to override in order to get the intended results.\r\n\r\n**What does that mean and how it works?**\r\n\r\nFor you to not always have to do `Rectangle rect = new Rectangle()` for every single class and object, the Rectangle becomes a subclass of the Shape class.\r\n\r\nThis enables you to later do `Shape rect = new Rectangle()`.\r\nThe big benefit of this is that you create an abstraction mechanism, meaning that you have a lot of shapes, either rectangles or triangles etc, but they all are Shape objects in the end.\r\n\r\nSo later you can just do:\r\n\r\n    Shape rect = new Rectangle();\r\n    Shape triangle = new Triangle();\r\n    rect.calculate();\r\n    triangle.calculate();\r\n\r\nInstead of the more meticulous:\r\n\r\n    Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();\r\n    Triangle triangle = new Triangle();\r\n    rect.calculate();\r\n    triangle.calculate();\r\n\r\nThe former can further be utilised by:\r\n\r\n    // Putting all the objects in a list\r\n    List&lt;Shape&gt; shapes = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n    // Create objects and add them\r\n    Shape rect = new Rectangle();\r\n    Shape triangle = new Triangle();\r\n    shapes.add(rect);\r\n    shapes.add(triangle);\r\n\r\nAs you can see for yourself, it is easier to handle and iterate over a list with all the elements being of type/class Shape. \r\n\r\n    // Basic example\r\n    for (Shape shape : shapes)\r\n        shape.calculateSomething();\r\n\r\nImagine if you had a hundred different shapes except Rectangle and Triangle. The latter method, without using inheritance, would quickly come to consume your project in an ever ending trial of maintenance and code changing. \r\n\r\nBy utilising inheritance otherwise, you can increase your Shape classes as much in quantity as you want and the same methods that used to work for a Shape, would still work for all the future new objects.\r\n\r\n**How does it work in practise? How do i create a subclass?**\r\n\r\nAs you already know you can *link* your classes through the `extend` keyword.\r\nBut that is only the start.\r\n\r\nTo be able to utilize the inheritance, you will have to overwrite the method of your choosing, in the child class.\r\n\r\nTake for instance the previous example:\r\n\r\n    Shape rect = new Rectangle();\r\n    rect.calculate();\r\n\r\nBut that raises the question, how can you get the correct value of `calculate()` method, when `Shape` class has a -1 or 0 returning from it and `rect` variable is now of type `Shape`?\r\n\r\nEasily, you can override a method of the parent class through the `@Override` tag and by implementing the same method again on the child class but with different calculations. Example:\r\n\r\n    class Shape {\r\n        \r\n        public void calculate() { return 0; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    class Rectangle extends Shape {\r\n         \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void calculate() { return 2; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote that the name, variables etc of the method must be identical.\r\n\r\nNow in the case of:\r\n\r\n    Shape rect = new Rectangle();\r\n    rect.calculate();\r\n\r\nthe `calculate()` method will return the number *2*. \r\nThis happens because even though the `rect` object is of type `Shape`, it is also a `Rectangle`. Every Rectangle is a Shape. So when you try to call the desired method, the program knows to choose the overrided method of the Rectangle class, because in essence it is a Rectangle, covered by the abstraction Shape.\r\n\r\nThis works for any number of Shape subclasses, each with their own unique implementation of the method.\r\n\r\nAlso note that a Rectangle subclass can have its own private fields that are used in the other methods:\r\n\r\n    class Rectangle extends Shape {\r\n        private int height;\r\n        private int width;\r\n\r\n        // constructor\r\n        public Rectangle(int h, int w) {\r\n             this.height = h;\r\n             this.width = w;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void calculate() { \r\n                return this.w * this.h; \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo to answer your question, you just override the methods you want for each class as you desire. If a method is not overriden, then the original of the `Shape` parent class is run. \r\n\r\nI hope this shined a little bit of light in your confusion towards abstraction and inheritance. \r\n\r\n**PS:**\r\nI know that you might be confused, but there are hundreds of answers and forums out there explaining this exact thing and that is how we all learned it. It needs time unfortunately but you will have a deeper understanding if you look at something yourself.

Chaining ensures that whenever you do <code>map.get( \"abra ka dabra\" );</code>, you end up with the correct value associated with the key.

Is than an alternate loader that doesn&#39;t do this?\r\n\r\n**Update 3:** Changing the association for Unit -&gt; UnitAux to unidirectional reduced the latency by roughly half. Now it&#39;s only 3x slower.\r\n\r\n**Update 4:** This is very strange. After experimenting with a variety of things, I made the following discovery. If I enable logging at the INFO (or ERROR) level for hibernate (see below config), everything runs fast, at the expected timing:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;logger name=&quot;org.hibernate&quot; additivity=&quot;false&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;level value=&quot;info&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;appender-ref ref=&quot;STDOUT&quot;/&gt;\r\n&lt;/logger&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf logging isn&#39;t declared, it runs slow (meaning nothing is specifically configured for hibernate). Is this something peculiar with jboss logging? I&#39;m using jboss-logging-3.4.2.Final.jar. Does it run slower if nothing is explicitly declared in the log4j.xml? It&#39;s like the classic problem of having debug statements that never get used, but Java has to build all of the string values, which leads to extreme latency.\r\n\r\n**Update 5:** I just did a spot check of the source code for Hibernate Core 5.6.0-Final. 141 classes use log.trace, and there are 249 class that use log.debug. Most of the log.trace calls don&#39;t pre-check to see if TRACE is enabled.

The bottom of the screen consists of 4 LinearLayouts that act as buttons (class_btn_1, class_btn_2, class_btn_3, and class_btn_4). The program is Android/Java. Everything works in the code as expected. But, the system's touch animation for any of the &quot;buttons&quot; always appears on the 4th button, regardless of which of the 4 buttons are tapped. Anyone know why that may be?</p>\n<p>Config info:</p>\n<pre><code>        minSdkVersion 27 // API version for Moto G5 is 27\n        targetSdkVersion 31\n</code></pre>\n<p>Versions of dependencies:</p>\n<pre><code>    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.4.0'\n    implementation 'androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.1.2'\n    implementation 'androidx.preference:preference:1.1.1'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Xml for the Fragment definition.

Unlike my first answer to hit the min and max boundaries independently, this is finding the range for the target element to determine if the subarray contains the eligible numbers.\r\n\r\n**Explanation:**\r\n\r\nTo simplify the question, I define it as if any numbers of subarray is in the given range and the method should be in time complexity less than O(n^2).\r\n\r\nOnce the array is sorted, it is easy to do it in binary search. The solution starts from the middle element (int mid = (start + end) / 2) to search a number within the given range. When the element meets the range requirement, the loop terminates.
