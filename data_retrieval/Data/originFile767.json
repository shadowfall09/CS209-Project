See [*Java Language and Virtual Machine Specifications*][4].\r\n\r\nSeveral vendors release software implementing those specifications. These vendors include, in no specific order: Amazon, BellSoft, IBM, Oracle, SAP, Azul Systems, Microsoft, Red Hat, and more. \r\n\r\nNearly all of these implementations are built largely, if not entirely, from the source code housed at the [*OpenJDK*][5] open-source project. That project is owned by Oracle Corp. Others contribute code and labor, including IBM, Apple, and more. \r\n\r\nOracle also owned a set of specifications for software to run on top of Java SE implementations. These specs were known as *Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE)* because they were aimed primarily at enterprise-oriented developers. Oracle in recent years donated these specs and related technologies to the [Eclipse Foundation][6], where they were open-sourced. The name changed to [*Jakarta EE*][7]. \r\n\r\nSeveral vendors publish software that implement the Jakarta EE specs. Some of these vendors publish app server software that bundle several of the Jakarta EE implementations to form a deployment container for your app that uses these Jakarta EE technologies. \r\n\r\n[*Apache Tomcat*][8] is one such product that provides implementations of several Jakarta EE specs in a web app deployment container. These implemented specs include [*Jakarta Servlet*][9], [*Jakarta Server Pages*][10], [*Jakarta Expression Language*][11], and more. \r\n\r\nThe Eclipse Foundation also publishes a popular [IDE][12].

Actualy *.html files are not so big a deal, but to restart server after every small css and js change is slowing me down a lot, and as I lost almost 15 hours figuring out what is wrong, it started to be really frustrating.</p>\n\n<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","keycloak"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4398735,"reputation":1404,"user_id":3585050,"accept_rate":31,"display_name":"reza ramezani matin"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1672473678,"creation_date":1672473678,"answer_id":74968286,"question_id":74938443,"body_markdown":"I am using Keycloak-20 and I solved the problem by doing the following steps:\r\n\r\n1- In the its themes directory, I created a folder that its name should be your theme name such as mytheme.\r\n\r\n2- One of three that is used by you or all of them; it depends on you, (account, login, email) folder is created, for example I created login folder.\r\n\r\nSo till now the directory path that is created by me is :  `/mythem/login` under the `themes` directory\r\n\r\n4- In the login directory, I created `theme.properties` that contains:\r\n\r\n    parent=keycloak\r\n    import=common/keycloak\r\n    locales=en,fa\r\n\r\nSo the message bundle of **fa** that should be in messages directory like this:\r\n\r\nI created the messages directory into login directory; the path is: `/mytheme/login/messages` and is created **messages_fa.properties**.\r\n\r\n5- So you can navigate to Localization tab of Keycloak setting menu and select your supported-local.","title":"How to add supported locales option in the localization of keycloak","body":"<p>I am using Keycloak-20 and I solved the problem by doing the following steps:</p>\n<p>1- In the its themes directory, I created a folder that its name should be your theme name such as mytheme.</p>\n<p>2- One of three that is used by you or all of them; it depends on you, (account, login, email) folder is created, for example I created login folder.</p>\n<p>So till now the directory path that is created by me is :  <code>/mythem/login</code> under the <code>themes</code> directory</p>\n<p>4- In the login directory, I created <code>theme.properties</code> that contains:</p>\n<pre><code>parent=keycloak\nimport=common/keycloak\nlocales=en,fa\n</code></pre>\n<p>So the message bundle of <strong>fa</strong> that should be in messages directory like this:</p>\n<p>I created the messages directory into login directory; the path is: <code>/mytheme/login/messages</code> and is created <strong>messages_fa.properties</strong>.</p>\n<p>5- So you can navigate to Localization tab of Keycloak setting menu and select your supported-local.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":4398735,"reputation":1404,"user_id":3585050,"accept_rate":31,"display_name":"reza ramezani matin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1244,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":74968286,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1672473678,"creation_date":1672219424,"question_id":74938443,"body_markdown":"I am using Keycloak 20.0.1.\r\n\r\nI want to add an option that does not exist (such as persian) to `Supported locales` combobox of localization-tab in Realm-setting menu.\r\n\r\nHow do I add this option to the combobox?\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ijdtc.png","title":"How to add supported locales option in the localization of keycloak","body":"<p>I am using Keycloak 20.0.1.</p>\n<p>I want to add an option that does not exist (such as persian) to <code>Supported locales</code> combobox of localization-tab in Realm-setting menu.</p>\n<p>How do I add this option to the combobox?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ijdtc.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ijdtc.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","jpa"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":4265983,"reputation":545,"user_id":3489098,"display_name":"Laurenzo"},"score":0,"creation_date":1660807908,"post_id":36563595,"comment_id":129621193,"body_markdown":"May I ask @Jeff that if the answer solved your issue, can you accept it as the correct answer?

And no type cast is going to **change** the **actual** type of an object.  That is just not possible in Java.  A reference type to reference type cast in Java does not change the actual class of the object.\r\n\r\nIf you want to arrange that you can use the result of `jsonObj.getJSONArray(key)` as your custom `JsonArray` type, you are going to have to *create* it with that type in the first place.  \r\n\r\nHow? \r\n\r\n  - Possibly using a JSON binding with a custom object mapper.  (But I have my doubts that approach will work.)\r\n\r\n  - Possibly by making your `JsonArray` a wrapper class for `JSONArray`.

Basically, we have to send a bunch of SMS messages. For sending messages an object called SMPPSession is used but in this example I&#39;ll just use superficial code. SMPPSession is supposed to send messages to SMSC server and to reestablish session in situations when connection breaks.  I would like to use multiple threads for sending multiple messages, and to have a separate single thread, some sort of &quot;guardian&quot;/ &quot;watcher&quot;/&quot;notifier&quot;.

Basically, we have to send a bunch of SMS messages. For sending messages an object called SMPPSession is used but in this example I'll just use superficial code. SMPPSession is supposed to send messages to SMSC server and to reestablish session in situations when connection breaks.  I would like to use multiple threads for sending multiple messages, and to have a separate single thread, some sort of &quot;guardian&quot;/ &quot;watcher&quot;/&quot;notifier&quot;.

Even if this had worked, it would make it hard to map them back again from the caller, which would need to then know the order of all the .select()ed fields to be able to find them again - and since the `original` might have itself been built from other dynamic SQL operations, that might not be feasible.\r\n\r\nFinally I considered an approach where every column of every table was already qualified with the table name already, but beyond this being onerous, it also doesn&#39;t help at all in cases where a table could be joined twice into the same query.\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s the correct dynamic SQL approach with jOOQ to make it possible to wrap a query with pagination, and still map records back to their individual tables?\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n*EDIT: Based on the comments, I&#39;ve modified the query from the blog post, and while this actually emits runnable SQL, the premise of the blog post still seems faulty, and still eludes me.*\r\n\r\n&gt; Irrespective of the complexity (including joins, other window functions, grouping, recursion, and what not), jOOQ will have you covered and will now paginate things for you.\r\n\r\nIn this iteration, the `as` syntax for the nested selects now come with renamed columns, and the outer query uses those column names.

However, `Record.into(Table)` no longer has the context it needs to understand that the first `id` column is for the `foo` table, and the second is for the `bar` table:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+----+----+------+----------------+---------+----------+----+------------+\r\n|  id|  id|foo_id|actual_page_size|last_page|total_rows| row|current_page|\r\n+----+----+------+----------------+---------+----------+----+------------+\r\n|   1|   1|     1|               3|true     |         3|   1|           1|\r\n|   2|   2|     2|               3|true     |         3|   2|           1|\r\n|   2|   3|     2|               3|true     |         3|   3|           1|\r\n+----+----+------+----------------+---------+----------+----+------------+\r\n\r\n+----+\r\n|  id|\r\n+----+\r\n|   2|\r\n+----+\r\n\r\n+----+------+\r\n|  id|foo_id|\r\n+----+------+\r\n|   2|     2|\r\n+----+------+\r\n```\r\nSo, to put the question in concrete terms: Is there a way to indicate to jOOQ that a `Select&lt;?&gt;`&#39;s fields should be mapped to a particular Table?\r\n\r\nAnd, as a more general question, but less subject to the X/Y problem: How can this paginate() method actually be used as in the example, with joins, where the joined tables have colliding column names? Is there a problem with this strategy of building up a query dynamically, and is there another strategy that can be followed instead, without this shortcoming?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://blog.jooq.org/calculating-pagination-metadata-without-extra-roundtrips-in-sql/\r\n\r\n","title":"Dynamic SQL via jOOQ for paginating joined tables with same-named columns","body":"<p>I'm following a <a href=\"https://blog.jooq.org/calculating-pagination-metadata-without-extra-roundtrips-in-sql/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">jOOQ blog post about paging metadata</a>, and trying to implement it generally for a project.
