Complications arise in the fact that you&#39;d need to be monitoring the label for drags, but converting the position of the movement to the parent container.  Doable, but it&#39;s an additional complication\r\n\r\n# With a `JLabel`\r\n\r\nThe basic workflow is the same, except now you need to manage the component state of the label (in fact labels, because I assume you&#39;ll also want to have some text).\r\n\r\nThis is a basic example which allows you to drag the a label, it&#39;s core workflow is basically the same as the previous examples, but it has the added overhead of needing to manage the component(s) size and positions as well\r\n\r\n\r\n    import java.awt.Dimension;\r\n    import java.awt.EventQueue;\r\n    import java.awt.GridBagLayout;\r\n    import java.awt.Insets;\r\n    import java.awt.Point;\r\n    import java.awt.event.MouseAdapter;\r\n    import java.awt.event.MouseEvent;\r\n    import java.io.IOException;\r\n    import java.util.logging.Level;\r\n    import java.util.logging.Logger;\r\n    import javax.imageio.ImageIO;\r\n    import javax.swing.ImageIcon;\r\n    import javax.swing.JFrame;\r\n    import javax.swing.JLabel;\r\n    import javax.swing.JPanel;\r\n    import javax.swing.SwingUtilities;\r\n    import javax.swing.border.EmptyBorder;\r\n    import javax.swing.border.LineBorder;\r\n\r\n    public class Test {\r\n\r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            new Test();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public Test() {\r\n            EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public void run() {\r\n                    try {\r\n                        JFrame frame = new JFrame();\r\n                        frame.add(new TestPane());\r\n                        frame.pack();\r\n                        frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\r\n                        frame.setVisible(true);\r\n                    } catch (IOException ex) {\r\n                        Logger.getLogger(Test.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public class TestPane extends JPanel {\r\n\r\n            public TestPane() throws IOException {\r\n                setBorder(new EmptyBorder(32, 32, 32, 32));\r\n                setLayout(new GridBagLayout());\r\n                add(new SlideToUnlock());\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public class SlideToUnlock extends JPanel {\r\n\r\n            private JLabel indicatorLabel;\r\n            private JPanel overLayPane;\r\n            private JLabel textLabel;\r\n\r\n            private Integer clickXOffset;\r\n            private Integer dragX;\r\n\r\n            public SlideToUnlock() throws IOException {\r\n                setLayout(null);\r\n                setBorder(new LineBorder(getForeground(), 1, true));\r\n                indicatorLabel = new JLabel(new ImageIcon(ImageIO.read(getClass().getResource(&quot;/images/ArrowRight.png&quot;))));\r\n                indicatorLabel.setBounds(1, 1, indicatorLabel.getPreferredSize().width, indicatorLabel.getPreferredSize().height);\r\n                add(indicatorLabel);\r\n\r\n                overLayPane = new JPanel();\r\n                add(overLayPane);\r\n\r\n                textLabel = new JLabel(&quot;Slide to unlock&quot;);\r\n                textLabel.setBounds(1, 1, textLabel.getPreferredSize().width, textLabel.getPreferredSize().height);\r\n                add(textLabel);\r\n\r\n                MouseAdapter mouseAdapter = new MouseAdapter() {\r\n\r\n                    protected void resetDrag() {\r\n                        clickXOffset = null;\r\n                        dragX = null;\r\n                    }\r\n\r\n                    @Override\r\n                    public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {\r\n                        Point point = e.getPoint();\r\n                        Point localPoint = SwingUtilities.convertPoint(SlideToUnlock.this, point, indicatorLabel);\r\n                        if (indicatorLabel.getBounds().contains(localPoint)) {\r\n                            clickXOffset = point.x -

Just check your aCount and bCount variables. Is one of them precisely 1? Then this substring works. If not, it doesn&#39;t. Increment your answer counter by 1 if it works, don&#39;t do that if it doesn&#39;t.\r\n* Next, move to the next substring. To calculate this, first get the character at your current position (0). Then __substract 1__ from `aCount` or `bCount` depending on what&#39;s there. Then, fetch the char at &#39;the end&#39; (`.charAt(pos + x)`) and add 1 to aCount or bCount depending on what&#39;s there. Your `aCount` and `bCount` vars now represent how many As respectively Bs are in the substring that starts at pos 1. And it only took 2 constant steps to update these vars.\r\n* ... and loop. Keep looping until the _end_ (`pos + x`) is at the end of the string.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is `O(n)`: Given, say, an input string of 1000 chars, and a substring check of 10, then the setup costs 10, and the central loop costs 990 loops. `O(n)` to the dot. `.charAt` is `O(1)`, and you need two of them on every loop. Constant factors don&#39;t change big-O number.\r\n\r\n","title":"Effeciently remove single letter substrings from a string","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>Effeciently remove single letter substrings from a string</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is completely impossible.

So, if <code>x</code> is 3, and input is <code>ABABA</code>, you want to end with <code>aCount = 2</code> and <code>bCount = 1</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With that prepwork completed, let's run the algorithm:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check for your current substring (that's the substring that starts at 0) if it 'works'. <strong>You do not need to run <code>substring</code> or do any string manipulation at all to know this</strong>. Just check your aCount and bCount variables. Is one of them precisely 1? Then this substring works. If not, it doesn't. Increment your answer counter by 1 if it works, don't do that if it doesn't.</li>\n<li>Next, move to the next substring. To calculate this, first get the character at your current position (0). Then <strong>substract 1</strong> from <code>aCount</code> or <code>bCount</code> depending on what's there. Then, fetch the char at 'the end' (<code>.charAt(pos + x)</code>) and add 1 to aCount or bCount depending on what's there. Your <code>aCount</code> and <code>bCount</code> vars now represent how many As respectively Bs are in the substring that starts at pos 1. And it only took 2 constant steps to update these vars.</li>\n<li>... and loop. Keep looping until the <em>end</em> (<code>pos + x</code>) is at the end of the string.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is <code>O(n)</code>: Given, say, an input string of 1000 chars, and a substring check of 10, then the setup costs 10, and the central loop costs 990 loops. <code>O(n)</code> to the dot. <code>.charAt</code> is <code>O(1)</code>, and you need two of them on every loop. Constant factors don't change big-O number.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":23688619,"reputation":21,"user_id":17713223,"display_name":"Abhi Sharma"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":131,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":70408894,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1639886594,"creation_date":1639886093,"question_id":70408864,"body_markdown":"So I&#39;ve been trying to attack this problem for a while but have no idea how to do it efficiently.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m given a substring of N (N &gt;= 3) characters, and the substring contains solely of the characters &#39;A&#39; and &#39;B&#39;.

And it is usually a good idea to make defensive copies of mutable items that they are retrieving to ensure that the retrieved values are consistent for all users during execution of the program.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":20645614,"reputation":41,"user_id":15157202,"display_name":"Slaven Stajić"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":678,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1640083938,"accepted_answer_id":70406799,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1639871918,"creation_date":1639849755,"question_id":70405704,"body_markdown":" So everything works great in my program, but I read that making variable not private in class is a big mistake, because it can make problems with others part of big program.\r\n\r\nWell I tried making HashMap airplane and flight private but I get error that &quot;The field Airplane.airplane is not visible&quot;,which is of course true. \r\n\r\nBut how do I then make it visible in interface class?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, I&#39;m still learning and I got to this part in course. \r\n\r\n\r\n    import java.util.ArrayList;\r\n    import java.util.HashMap;\r\n    import java.util.Scanner;\r\n    \r\n    public class Main {\r\n    \t\r\n    \t\r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        \t\r\n          Scanner imeskanera = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n          Airplane airplane = new Airplane();\r\n          flight flight = new flight();\r\n          \r\n          interface_aerodrom ui = new interface_aerodrom(imeskanera,airplane,flight);\r\n          \r\n          ui.start();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n/ Airplane class\r\n\r\n    import java.util.HashMap;\r\n    \r\n    public class Airplane {\r\n    \t HashMap&lt;String,Integer&gt;airplane;\r\n    \tprivate String id;\r\n    \tprivate int capacity;\r\n    \t\r\n    \tpublic Airplane() {\r\n    \t\tthis.airplane = new HashMap&lt;String,Integer&gt;();\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \t\r\n    \tpublic void add(String id, int capacity) {\r\n    \t\tthis.id = id;\r\n    \t\tthis.capacity = capacity;\r\n    \t\tthis.airplane.put(id, capacity);\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t}\r\n    \tpublic String id() {\r\n    \t\treturn this.id;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \tpublic int capacity() {\r\n    \t\treturn this.capacity;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic String airplaneinfo() {\r\n    \t\treturn this.id + &quot;( &quot;

Now I need to connect that application from my local computer, but I don&#39;t know the JMX port number of the remote computer. Where can I find it? Or, must I restart that application with some VM parameters to specify the port number?\r\n\r\nBy default JMX does not publish on a port unless you specify the arguments from this page: [How to activate JMX...][1]\r\n\r\n    -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote\r\n    -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9010\r\n    -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only=false\r\n    -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false\r\n    -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false\r\n    -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=localhost\r\n\r\n*NOTE:* you need to be careful of the security ramifications of some of the above settings.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you are running you should be able to access any of those system properties to see if they have been set:\r\n\r\n\tif (System.getProperty(&quot;com.sun.management.jmxremote&quot;) == null) {\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;JMX remote is disabled&quot;);\r\n\t} else [\r\n\t\tString portString = System.getProperty(&quot;com.sun.management.jmxremote.port&quot;);\r\n\t\tif (portString != null) {\r\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;JMX running on port &quot;\r\n\t\t\t\t+ Integer.parseInt(portString));\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nDepending on how the server is connected, you might also have to specify the following parameter.  As part of the initial JMX connection, jconsole connects up to the RMI port to determine which port the JMX server is running on.  When you initially start up a JMX enabled application, it looks its own hostname to determine what address to return in that initial RMI transaction.  If your hostname is not in `/etc/hosts` or if it is set to an incorrect interface address then you can override it with the following:\r\n\r\n    -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=&lt;IP address&gt;\r\n\r\nAs an aside, my [SimpleJMX package][2] allows you to define both the [JMX server][3] and the [RMI port][4] or set them both to the same port.  The above port defined with `com.sun.management.jmxremote.port` is actually the RMI port.

As part of the initial JMX connection, jconsole connects up to the RMI port to determine which port the JMX server is running on.  When you initially start up a JMX enabled application, it looks its own hostname to determine what address to return in that initial RMI transaction.  If your hostname is not in <code>/etc/hosts</code> or if it is set to an incorrect interface address then you can override it with the following:</p>\n<pre><code>-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=&lt;IP address&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>As an aside, my <a href=\"http://256stuff.com/sources/simplejmx/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SimpleJMX package</a> allows you to define both the <a href=\"http://256stuff.com/sources/simplejmx/javadoc/simplejmx/com/j256/simplejmx/server/JmxServer.html#setServerPort%28int%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JMX server</a> and the <a href=\"http://256stuff.com/sources/simplejmx/javadoc/simplejmx/com/j256/simplejmx/server/JmxServer.html#setRegistryPort%28int%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RMI port</a> or set them both to the same port.

The heap pollution only ever seems to occur in this manner, for example:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public void example(List&lt;Integer&gt;... lists) {\n    // lists[0] = Collections.singletonList(&quot;A!&quot;);\n    Object[] objects = lists;\n    objects[0] = Collections.singletonList(&quot;B!&quot;); // (pollutes!)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Some other articles (<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/32291696/17556153\">such as this SO answer</a>) also appear to be incorrect or entirely misleading:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So now we have a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> that actually contains an <code>Integer</code>, and it's floating around, safely.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The code presented in the answer never modifies the lists themselves, just the temporary varargs array within the <code>faultyMethod</code> scope. This <a href=\"https://jdoodle.com/ia/lhS\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">runnable demo</a> shows that neither of the two lists are ever polluted and both retain their original <code>String</code> objects (contrary to the answer suggesting they are polluted with an <code>Integer</code>).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I now have two resulting questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Why does the compiler need to warn us on every possible method when the vast majority of them will not be converting to <code>Object[]</code> - surely it would be better to only warn on the problematic <code>Object[]</code> line itself? Perhaps there is a scenario where &quot;possible heap pollution from parameterized vararg type&quot; can occur without any explicit <code>Object[]</code> conversion?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Is the answer to the previous SO question incorrect or am I misinterpreting the statement?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":["java","if-statement","user-input"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2818342,"reputation":299856,"user_id":2422776,"display_name":"Mureinik"},"score":0,"creation_date":1639863914,"post_id":70407373,"comment_id":124458479,"body_markdown":"What exactly is the problem?","body":"What exactly is the problem?"},{"owner":{"account_id":23686708,"reputation":1,"user_id":17711546,"display_name":"Cashif"},"score":0,"creation_date":1639864225,"post_id":70407373,"comment_id":124458552,"body_markdown":"I want to enter the value for inp variable but I&#39;m unable to enter the value of it.

This means that painting is done when the system decides it needs to be done.  You can &quot;request&quot; a paint pass via the `RepaintManager` (normal via calling `repaint` on the component)\r\n\r\nWhat this does is, if the `RepaintManager` agrees, places a &quot;paint&quot; event on the Event Dispatching Queue, which is, at some point in the future picked up by the Event Dispatching Thread and a paint pass is executed (this may be consolidated so that multiple components are painted in one pass).\r\n\r\nThere are two problems you&#39;re facing:\r\n\r\n1. Painting can occur for any number of reasons, many of which you don&#39;t control and you&#39;re notified by\r\n2. There&#39;s no reliable way to determine if or when a paint pass will/has occurred.\r\n\r\nNow, add in the issue that Swing is not thread safe and you run into a mountain of other issues.\r\n\r\nSee [Concurrency in Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html) for more details.\r\n\r\nSo, what&#39;s the answer?\r\n\r\nWell, you could use [Worker Threads and SwingWorker](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/worker.html) or a [Swing `Timer`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/timer.html) to synchronise the updates depending on your needs, but honestly, I don&#39;t think making use of Swing&#39;s paint process is what you really need.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration would be use a backing buffer of your own.  That is, use two or more `BufferedImage`s onto which you draw the &quot;state&quot; and then pass these to the canvas to be drawn at some point in the future.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would suggest taking control of the painting process directly yourself.  Instead, have a look at [BufferStrategy and BufferCapabilities](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/fullscreen/bufferstrategy.html) (and the [JavaDocs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/awt/image/BufferStrategy.html) because it has a nice example).\r\n\r\nThis will provide you with direct control over the painting process so you can decide when and how it should be painted.","title":"How to clear a list only after drawing has finished","body":"<p>First, go read <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/painting/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Performing Custom Painting</a> and <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/painting.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Painting in AWT and Swing</a> to get a better understanding of how painting works in Swing.</p>\n<p>Swing is lazy and makes use of a passive rendering workflow.
