I&#39;m going to explain it first so you know what to avoid, and to put the factory solution in context.\r\n\r\n## Reflective access\r\n\r\nClasses have an object representation: An instance of the `java.lang.Class` class. You can get these instances trivially: `Class&lt;?&gt; c = String.class;` gets you the class object representing the string class. Not &quot;A string&quot; - that&#39;d be `String x = &quot;&quot;;` - nono, the concept of all strings as a type. You can also get them via `Class&lt;?&gt; c = Class.forName(&quot;java.lang.String&quot;);` as well.\r\n\r\nGiven such an object, you can fetch the no-args constructor and invoke it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nClass&lt;?&gt; c = Class.forName(&quot;java.lang.String&quot;);\r\nConstructor&lt;?&gt; noArgsConstructor = c.getConstructor();\r\nObject fresh = noArgsConstructor.newInstance();\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;&quot;.equals(fresh)); // prints &#39;true&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, there are a bunch of problems with this:\r\n\r\n* The generics of `Class` (and `Constructor`) are broken. Generics allows generics - you can have a `List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;` (generics in your generics). However, there is only one class instance per class, in other words, `List&lt;String&gt;` and `List&lt;Integer&gt;`? That&#39;s the same class - hence, only one `Class` instance, hence __`Class` instances cannot themselves have generics__. On the flipside, generics can&#39;t deal with primitives (`List&lt;int&gt;` is not (yet) a thing in java), but `int.class` works fine and gets you a `Class` instance representing primitive ints. So, it&#39;s a broken abstraction and this results in all sorts of issues. Specifically, imagine a method that takes in a `Class&lt;?&gt;` instance; your method will make a new object and then invoke something on it:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface Namable {\r\n  void setName(String name);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static &lt;T extends Namable&gt; T create(Class&lt;T&gt; type) {\r\n  T namable = type.newConstructor().newInstance();\r\n  namable.setName(&quot;Jane&quot;);\r\n  return namable;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// to use:\r\n\r\n@lombok.Data\r\nclass Person implements Namable {\r\n  String name;\r\n}\r\n\r\nPerson p = create(Person.class);\r\nSystem.out.println(p.name); // prints &#39;Jane&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo far, so good. But now let&#39;s do the same thing but using `List` instead of `Namable`:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic &lt;L extends List&lt;String&gt;&gt; L create(Class&lt;L&gt; listType) {\r\n  List&lt;String&gt; list = listType.getConstructor().newInstance();\r\n  list.add(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);\r\n  return list;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis.. compiles fine but you can&#39;t use it without lots of problems and compiler warnings:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate(ArrayList&lt;String&gt;.class); // does not compile\r\ncreate(ArrayList.class); // does, but warnings.\r\n```\r\n\r\n* This reflective access throws a ton of exceptions. You can handle them of course, but it&#39;s annoying.\r\n\r\n* The compiler and type system won&#39;t help you here. As part of the &#39;contract&#39;, the `Class&lt;T&gt; type` parameter must be some type which has all sorts of requirements: It needs to be instantiable (cannot be an interface or abstract or an enum), and it needs to have a `public` constructor that takes zero arguments. Any exceptions it throws also end up wrapped because you can&#39;t put limits on which checked exceptions it can throw either. This is a worst of both worlds solution: Java is strongly and nominally typed but we ditch all that here and just decree what is required in the documentation, and if you feel to heed the docs, no compiler/write-time errors occur at all, it&#39;ll blow up with some sort of error at runtime. That&#39;s bad.\r\n\r\nHence, __this is not a good idea__.\r\n\r\n## Factory pattern\r\n\r\nThe reason it&#39;s all so wonky is that __static members do not &#39;do&#39; type hierarchy__. A constructor is simply a wonky static method - think about it: You cannot declare that some constructor is required in an interface - that&#39;s the same as static methods. They do not do dynamic dispatch either - just like static methods. They do not require a receiver (the `x` in `x.foo()` is called the receiver) - just like static methods.\r\n\r\nYou simply cannot make an interface that decrees that any type that `implements` that interface must have certain static properties. At all. java as a language fundamentally doesn&#39;t work that way. Only instances play the dynamic dispatch game and thus only for instances does it make sense to have a type hierarchy that lets you make promises (such as: &quot;All things that are of type `List` have a `.size()` method regardless of which particular list it is), and thus, lets the tooling (compiler, editor) help.\r\n\r\nSo, we need to somehow turn static things into instance things.\r\n\r\nEnter: __The factory pattern__.\r\n\r\nA factory is simply a second meta-layer describing not so much &#39;a tree&#39; as &#39;a thing that knows about a certain genus of trees and can make new trees&#39;:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface Tree {\r\n  void sprout();\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Birch implements Tree {\r\n  public void sprout() { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe add to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface TreeFactory {\r\n  Tree create();\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class BirchFactory implements TreeFactory {\r\n  Birch create() { return new Birch(); }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have now &#39;instance-ified&#39; what used to be a static aspect - as per the notion of &#39;tree&#39; or &#39;birch&#39;, `create()` is &quot;static&quot; - as a concept it applies to all of them. But from the notion of a &#39;tree maker&#39;, `create()` is an instance thing - each tree maker has its own create concept.\r\n\r\nWith this pattern, all problems that reflective access have go away:\r\n\r\n* You can use the interface to decree that you have e.g. no arguments.\r\n\r\n* No weird checked exceptions to deal with.\r\n\r\n* Works just fine with generics.\r\n\r\n## Implicit factories\r\n\r\nOne variant of factories is the implicit factory - instead of explicitly making a `TreeFactory` object, you can also just pass along a function that makes them on the fly. In fact, java core library&#39;s own `Collectors.toMap` and `Collection.toArray` employ this technique: Due to generics a collection cannot actually create a new array of the right type so it needs you to tell it how to do that. You can do this with a `IntFunction&lt;E[]&gt;` - a function that takes in an `int` and emits an `E[]` where `E` is the type of the collection component:\r\n\r\n```\r\nList&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();\r\nlist.toArray(size -&gt; new String[size]);\r\n// or simpler:\r\nlist.toArray(String[]::new);\r\n```\r\n\r\nand you can apply the same techique to your code:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic &lt;T extends Tree&gt; List&lt;T&gt; plantManyTrees(int size, Supplier&lt;? extends T&gt; treeFactory) {\r\n  var planted = new ArrayList&lt;T&gt;();\r\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {\r\n    planted.add(treeFactory.get());\r\n  }\r\n  return planted;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// to use:\r\n\r\nList&lt;Birch&gt; copseOfBirches = plantManyTrees(100, () -&gt; new Birch());\r\n```\r\n\r\nor even, if you want, say, a dynamic string-based lookup for tree types:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMap&lt;String, Supplier&lt;? extends Tree&gt;&gt; makers = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\nmakers.put(&quot;Birch&quot;, () -&gt; new Birch());\r\nmakers.put(&quot;Willow&quot;, () -&gt; new Willow());\r\n```\r\n\r\nand so on\r\n","title":"Can i store a list of types to intantiate?","body":"<p>You have 2 options here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Factory pattern (recommended)</li>\n<li>Reflective access (don't go here)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nevertheless the second option is quite common.

If so, how can I ensure that the result of this callback is sent to the correct user?</p>\n<p>Here is the endpoint I expose to Kakao:</p>\n<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value = &quot;/callback/kakao&quot; , method = RequestMethod.GET)\npublic String callback(@RequestParam final String code,  final HttpServletRequest request, final HttpServletResponse response,Model model) {\nString path = configurationService.getConfiguration().getString(&quot;redirect.uri.kakao&quot;);\nString accessToken = facade.getAccessTokenFromKakao(code, getFullRequestUrl(request,path));\n\nKakaoProfile profile = facade.getUserInfo(accessToken);\n        \npopulateData(model, profile)\n\n//the response that I must return as response I fill the profile in the model with the necessary info inside populatedata méthod.\nreturn ControllerConstants.Pages.RESPONSE;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Please let me know if the callback doesn't identify the user who initiated the request and how I can ensure that the correct user receives the result of the callback.</p>\n<p>Here is the content of the Response page you return in the result:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;%@ page trimDirectiveWhitespaces=&quot;true&quot; %&gt;\n&lt;%@ taglib prefix=&quot;c&quot; uri=&quot;http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core&quot; %&gt;\n&lt;%@ taglib prefix=&quot;form&quot; uri=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/tags/form&quot; %&gt;\n&lt;%@ taglib prefix=&quot;spring&quot; uri=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/tags&quot; %&gt;   \n&lt;%@ taglib prefix=&quot;molecules&quot; tagdir=&quot;/WEB-INF/tags/responsive/common/molecules&quot; %&gt;\n&lt;%@ taglib prefix=&quot;atoms&quot; tagdir=&quot;/WEB-INF/tags/responsive/common/atoms&quot; %&gt;\n&lt;%@ taglib prefix=&quot;ycommerce&quot; uri=&quot;http://hybris.com/tld/ycommercetags&quot; %&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\nconst progressiveProfilingHtml = &quot;&lt;spring:escapeBody javaScriptEscape=&quot;true&quot;&gt; \n&lt;pages:progressive-profiling/&gt;&lt;/spring:escapeBody&gt;&quot;;\n\nwindow.addEventListener('beforeunload', () =&gt; { \n    window.opener.postMessage(progressiveProfilingHtml, '*'); \n});\nwindow.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, (event) =&gt; {\n    window.close();\n});\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I return the HTML that is already filled with the data from the model.</p>\n<p>And finally, I close the Kakao window to display the HTML of the progressive profiling on my site.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-webflux","spring-cloud-feign","feign","openfeign"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3101358,"reputation":962,"user_id":2625393,"display_name":"Numichi"},"score":0,"creation_date":1684419925,"post_id":76281656,"comment_id":134517395,"body_markdown":"I don&#39;t fully understand the question, but reactive implementation is built on async mechanism.
