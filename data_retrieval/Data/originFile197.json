Its name is confusing: the argument configures <code>MaxHeapSize</code>, not <code>MinHeapSize</code> - see <a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8278492\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JDK-8278492</a></p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":224290,"reputation":620,"user_id":484009,"display_name":"Popandopolos"},"score":0,"creation_date":1694183462,"post_id":77066519,"comment_id":135862117,"body_markdown":"I can suggest to check @apangin answer.  `-XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=100` works for me","body":"I can suggest to check @apangin answer.  <code>-XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=100</code> works for me"},{"owner":{"account_id":22153048,"reputation":1,"user_id":22522004,"display_name":"Cyrille MAUCCI"},"score":0,"creation_date":1694377101,"post_id":77066519,"comment_id":135879681,"body_markdown":"Works for us too!","body":"Works for us too!"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":22153048,"reputation":1,"user_id":22522004,"display_name":"Cyrille MAUCCI"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1694172699,"creation_date":1694172699,"answer_id":77066519,"question_id":77021695,"body_markdown":"we are seeing the same issue as Popandopolos here.\r\nMore precisely we are seeing a behavior change between Java11 and Java17.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we&#39;ve recently migrated our containers apps from Java11 to Java17 (our runtime container env is RedHat OpenShift 4.12).\r\n\r\nWe&#39;ve always been using the following options:\r\n&quot;-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=60 -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=60 -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch&quot;\r\nin order to guarantee the Heap would never be resized and therefore would never impact the runtime performance of our latency critical application.\r\n\r\nWith those settings, using Java11, we have always witnessed committed heap being set to 60% of the container memory limit for the whole lifetime of the container.\r\n\r\nAfter moving to Java17, it is like if InitialRAMPercentage was no more honored.\r\nCommitted heap starts very low and moves during the lifetime of the container.\r\nIf we -Xms/-Xmx instead of -XX:InitialRAMPercentage/-XX:MaxRAMPercentage, Java17 behaves exactly as Java11 would with -XX:InitialRAMPercentage/-XX:MaxRAMPercentage.\r\n\r\nSo, the behavior definitely changed between Java11 and Java17...\r\nand currently getting back to -Xms/-Xmx seems the only way to unblock our testing.\r\n\r\nHTH\r\n++Cyrille","title":"InitialRAMPercentage doesn&#39;t set initial heap size","body":"<p>we are seeing the same issue as Popandopolos here.\nMore precisely we are seeing a behavior change between Java11 and Java17.</p>\n<p>Indeed, we've recently migrated our containers apps from Java11 to Java17 (our runtime container env is RedHat OpenShift 4.12).</p>\n<p>We've always been using the following options:\n&quot;-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=60 -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=60 -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch&quot;\nin order to guarantee the Heap would never be resized and therefore would never impact the runtime performance of our latency critical application.</p>\n<p>With those settings, using Java11, we have always witnessed committed heap being set to 60% of the container memory limit for the whole lifetime of the container.</p>\n<p>After moving to Java17, it is like if InitialRAMPercentage was no more honored.\nCommitted heap starts very low and moves during the lifetime of the container.\nIf we -Xms/-Xmx instead of -XX:InitialRAMPercentage/-XX:MaxRAMPercentage, Java17 behaves exactly as Java11 would with -XX:InitialRAMPercentage/-XX:MaxRAMPercentage.</p>\n<p>So, the behavior definitely changed between Java11 and Java17...\nand currently getting back to -Xms/-Xmx seems the only way to unblock our testing.</p>\n<p>HTH\n++Cyrille</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":224290,"reputation":620,"user_id":484009,"display_name":"Popandopolos"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":365,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":77063467,"answer_count":3,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1694172699,"creation_date":1693557900,"question_id":77021695,"body_markdown":"We are running our Java application with OpenJDK 17.0.7 in a Docker container with these arguments (these are only relevant to my question):&lt;br&gt;\r\n`-XX:InitialRAMPercentage=75.0 -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75.0 -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1G -XX:+UseG1GC`\r\n\r\nHere is a picture from JDK Mission Control showing how the application starts:\r\n\r\n[![Run an application with InitialRAMPercentage][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can see that Committed size was not the same all the time.

routing</strong> of  Thymeleaf is always redirecting it to the <code>http://abcd.com/login</code> which is not accessible.</p>\n<p>Can anyone help with the resolution for this.?</p>\n<p>Also the ECS has one service, one load balancer and one Route53 for translating the names to IP address.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","firebase","android-studio","firebase-cloud-messaging"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":10866797,"reputation":1800,"user_id":8663492,"display_name":"Muntasir Aonik"},"score":0,"creation_date":1566871798,"post_id":57580464,"comment_id":101782187,"body_markdown":"Possible duplicate of [How to handle notification when app in background in Firebase](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37711082/how-to-handle-notification-when-app-in-background-in-firebase)","body":"Possible duplicate of <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37711082/how-to-handle-notification-when-app-in-background-in-firebase\">How to handle notification when app in background in Firebase</a>"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":26164197,"reputation":251,"user_id":19850238,"display_name":"vmvyas1989"},"score":0,"creation_date":1675398397,"post_id":72171234,"comment_id":132924961,"body_markdown":"What if want data from data payload ? when application is in kill mode retrieve notification but not getting data payload data","body":"What if want data from data payload ? when application is in kill mode retrieve notification but not getting data payload data"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":12982239,"reputation":59,"user_id":9384240,"display_name":"Shubham Vyas"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1694171532,"creation_date":1652095660,"answer_id":72171234,"question_id":57580464,"body_markdown":"Try removing &quot;notification&quot;

First because finally, at runtime, the parametrized type becomes a **concrete** and **single** type. So, in practice you **cannot mix** ClassA objects with ClassB objects.\r\n\r\nAnd second, because the compiler **must check** that whatever **you insert is casteable** to **ClassB**.

Let&#39;s break down your observations and try to understand what&#39;s happening:\r\n\r\nNetwork Latency: When you make a network request, such as fetching data from a server, the time it takes to complete the request can vary depending on the server&#39;s response time, network conditions, and other factors. In your case, when you access &quot;https://cnn.com,&quot; it appears to take longer to complete the request compared to &quot;https://stackoverflow.com.&quot; This difference in network latency can influence the overall timing of your code.\r\n\r\nThread Execution: You&#39;re starting a new thread in onResume to perform the network request and then update the UI using runOnUiThread. The timing of when the UI thread executes your code depends on the Android system&#39;s thread scheduling and how busy the system is with other tasks.\r\n\r\nUI Thread Execution: The runOnUiThread method is used to post a Runnable to the UI thread&#39;s message queue, which will be executed when the UI thread becomes available. The UI thread might be busy with other tasks, and there can be a delay in executing your Runnable if there&#39;s a backlog of UI events.\r\n\r\nGiven these factors, here&#39;s what&#39;s happening in your two scenarios:\r\n\r\nWith &quot;https://cnn.com,&quot; the network request takes longer to complete, and by the time the response is received, the UI thread might have other tasks to handle. This can introduce a delay in executing your runOnUiThread code.\r\n\r\nWith &quot;https://stackoverflow.com,&quot; the network request is faster, so the UI thread is more likely to be available when the response is received, resulting in a shorter delay before executing your runOnUiThread code.\r\n\r\nIn your log output, you can see the difference in timing between when the network request completes (TESTUI_2) and when the UI code executes (TESTUI_3). The delay is longer in the &quot;cnn.com&quot; case due to the longer network request time.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this issue and ensure more predictable UI updates, you can consider the following:\r\n\r\nUse AsyncTask or other Android-specific mechanisms for background tasks and UI updates.

Logging error messages and handling exceptions appropriately can help in diagnosing issues.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the observed behavior is likely due to a combination of network latency and thread management.

The size and height of the minefield is set as 4 <code>gridsize</code> and 8 <code>gridHeight</code>.\nThe first-time initilisation works - the 4 x 8 field out of buttons pops up. But after the first game, when changing the SeekBar <code>minesSeekBar</code> the Field gets bigger by one row although <code>gridHeight</code> is not changed.\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2mm7U.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">how  it looks on the first game</a>, <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DBK5q.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">how it looks after the first game</a></p>\n<p>I do not quite understand how there is a  row added when <code>gridHeight</code> is never changed. I suspected that the error might be in the <code>start.setOnClickListener(){}</code> but i could not fix it as the code makes sense (to me). Everytime the field gets redone everytime you press start so it should theoratically be always the same.\ni do not think the error is in <code>setupGame()</code> as the gridsize is not changed in the method.</p>\n<p>Here is the xml:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Button\n    android:id=&quot;@+id/menu1&quot;\n    android:layout_width=&quot;55dp&quot;\n    android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\n    android:layout_alignParentTop=&quot;true&quot;\n    android:layout_marginStart=&quot;340dp&quot;\n    android:layout_marginTop=&quot;10dp&quot;\n    android:background=&quot;@drawable/baseline_menu_24&quot;\n    app:cornerRadius=&quot;15dp&quot;\n    app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf=&quot;parent&quot;\n    app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf=&quot;parent&quot;\n    app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf=&quot;parent&quot;\n    app:layout_constraintVertical_bias=&quot;0.0&quot;

But we need this. So we need downloading the sources of used `ooxml-schemas-*.jar` (up to Apache PPOI 4) or `poi-ooxml-full jar` (since Apache POI 5). Then we can create a API documentation using `javadoc`.\r\n\r\nAll Office Open XML files, so also `*.xlsx`, are simply ZIP archives. So one can unzip a `*.xlsx` file using a ZIP application (7-Zip can do that for example). Then we can have a look into the internals.\r\n\r\nTo find out what to do for charts in `*.xlsx` when high level classes of Apache POI lack support for something, do the folowing:\r\n\r\nCreate a `*.xlsx` having a chart using what Apache POI provides. Then unzip that `*.xlsx` and show the content of `xl/chart/chart*.xml`. Then open that `*.xlsx`  in Excel GUI and do what you want to do additionally. Then save. Then unzip that `*.xlsx` and show the content of `xl/chart/chart*.xml`. Now compare what has changed in XML.

To provide your persistence layer with the proper information about how to manage the entity.\r\n\r\n### Why use the @Id annotation?\r\n- The `@Id` annotation is one of the two mandatory annotations needed when creating an entity with JPA. The other one being `@Entity`. `@Id` does two things for us:\r\n\r\n  **1)** signifies that this field will be the unique identifier for this class when mapped to a database table\r\n\r\n  **2)** the presence of `@Id` lets the persistence layer know that all other fields within this class are to be mapped to database rows\r\n\r\n### Why use @GeneratedValue?\r\n- By marking the `@Id` field with `@GeneratedValue` we are now enabling `id generation`. Which means that the persistence layer will generate an Id value for us and handle the auto incrementing. Our application can choose 1 of 4 generations strategies:\r\n\r\n  **1) AUTO**\r\n\r\n  **2) TABLE**\r\n\r\n  **3) SEQUENCE**\r\n\r\n  **4) IDENTITY**\r\n\r\n- If not strategy is specified then AUTO is assumed\r\n\r\n### What is strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY actually doing?\r\n- When we specify the generation strategy as `GenerationType.IDENTITY` we are telling the persistence provider(hibernate) to let the database handle the auto incrementing of the id. If you were to use postgres as an underling database and specified the strategy as `IDENTITY`, hibernate would execute this:\r\n```\r\ncreate table users (\r\n       id  bigserial not null,\r\n        primary key (id)\r\n    )\r\n\r\n```\r\n- Notice that they type of the id is `bigserial`, what is bigserial? As per the postgres [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/datatype-numeric.html), `bigserial is a large autoincrementing integer`.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n- By specifying:\r\n```\r\n@Id \r\n@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\r\nprivate Integer id;\r\n\r\n```\r\n- you have told the underlying persistence layer to use the id field as a unique identifier within the database.

Fragility**\r\nThe contract-last development style results in your web service contract (WSDL and your XSD) being generated from your Java contract (usually an interface). If you are using this approach, you will have no guarantee that the contract stays constant over time. Each time you change your Java code and redeploy it, there might be subsequent changes to the web service contract.\r\nAditionally, not all SOAP stacks generate the same web service contract from a Java contract.

Versioning**\r\nEven though a contract must remain constant for as long as possible, they do need to be changed sometimes. In Java, this typically results in a new Java interface, such as AirlineService2, and a (new) implementation of that interface. Of course, the old service must be kept around, because there might be clients who have not migrated yet.\r\nIf using contract-first, we can have a looser coupling between contract and implementation.
