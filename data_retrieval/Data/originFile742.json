The library can be obtained from Maven Central <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.michaelgantman/MgntUtils\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> or from <a href=\"https://github.com/michaelgantman/Mgnt/releases\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Github</a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":27356299,"reputation":1,"user_id":20864643,"display_name":"Viswanadh bhaskarla"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":621,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1673353367,"creation_date":1672059548,"question_id":74920547,"body_markdown":"public class APIService {\r\n\t\t\r\n\tprivate List&lt;CoinDTO&gt; coinList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\t\r\n\tprivate final TrackerConfigProperties trackerConfig;\r\n\t\r\n\t//Injecting configuration properties into the constructor.\r\n\tpublic APIService(TrackerConfigProperties trackerConfig) {\r\n\t\tthis.trackerConfig = trackerConfig;\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tpublic List&lt;CoinDTO&gt; getCoinList() {\r\n\t\treturn coinList;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic void setCoinList(List&lt;CoinDTO&gt; coinList) {\r\n\t\tthis.coinList = coinList;\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\t@PostConstruct\r\n\t@Scheduled(cron = &quot;* * 1 * * *&quot;)\r\n\tpublic void getAPIData() throws IOException, JSONException{\t\t\r\n\t\tList&lt;CoinDTO&gt; newData = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\t\tOkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tJSONObject obj = null;\r\n\t\tJSONObject data = null;\r\n\r\n\t\t//Use request builder to configure api \r\n\t\tRequest request = new Request.Builder()\r\n\t\t\t.url(trackerConfig.apiUrl())\r\n\t\t\t.get()\r\n\t\t\t.addHeader(&quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;, trackerConfig.apiKey())\r\n\t\t\t.addHeader(&quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;, trackerConfig.apiHost())\r\n\t\t\t.build();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tResponse response = null;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tresponse = client.newCall(request).execute();\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tString jsonResponse = response.body().string();\r\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(jsonResponse);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tobj = new JSONObject(jsonResponse);\r\n\t\t\tdata = obj.getJSONObject(&quot;data&quot;);\r\n\t\t\tJSONArray arr = data.getJSONArray(&quot;coins&quot;);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(arr);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tfor(int i=0; i&lt;arr.length(); i++) {\r\n\t\t\t\tCoinDTO coinRecords = new CoinDTO();\r\n\t\t\t\tcoinRecords.setName(arr.getJSONObject(i).getString(&quot;name&quot;));\r\n\t\t\t\tcoinRecords.setSymbol(arr.getJSONObject(i).getString(&quot;symbol&quot;));\r\n\t\t\t\tcoinRecords.setPrice(arr.getJSONObject(i).getFloat(&quot;price&quot;));\r\n\t\t\t\tcoinRecords.setRank(arr.getJSONObject(i).getInt(&quot;rank&quot;));\r\n\t\t\t\tcoinRecords.setChange(arr.getJSONObject(i).getFloat(&quot;change&quot;));\r\n\t\t\t\tcoinRecords.setUrl(arr.getJSONObject(i).getString(&quot;iconUrl&quot;));\r\n\t\t\t\tcoinRecords.setMarketCap(arr.getJSONObject(i).getString(&quot;marketCap&quot;));\r\n\t\t\t\tnewData.add(coinRecords);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tthis.coinList = newData;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t}catch(IOException e) {\r\n\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t// Requesting response.body().string() more than once will cause illegal state exception. \t\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe JSON response from crypto API looks very fishy. 1-60 results, there is no problem in getting the data.

In this case marking your implementation class with `@Repository` will allow you to have this class managed by spring so that you can autowire necessary fields to access data layer like `EntityManager` , `JdbcTemplate` ...etc. Although `Component`, and `@Repository` in the most fundamental level just register spring beans there are some slight enhancements using `@Repository` which might make it neccessary to use and also best practice in the current case.\r\n\r\nAs per [doc1][2]\r\n\r\n&gt; A class thus annotated with `@Repository` is eligible for Spring\r\n&gt; DataAccessException translation when used in conjunction with a\r\n&gt; PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor.,\r\n\r\nand [doc2][1]\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Bean post-processor that\r\n&gt; automatically applies persistence exception translation to any bean\r\n&gt; marked with Spring&#39;s @Repository annotation, adding a corresponding \r\n&gt; PersistenceExceptionTranslationAdvisor to the exposed proxy\r\n\r\nExample of above case use with `@Repository`.\r\n\r\n    @Repository\r\n    public class CustomCarRepositoryImpl implements CustomCarRepository {\r\n    \r\n        @PersistenceContext\r\n        private EntityManager entityManager;\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public List&lt;CarEntity&gt; findCarsWithSpeed(Integer speed) {\r\n    \r\n            return entityManager.createQuery(&quot;Query to execute&quot;)\r\n                    .setMaxResults(50).getResultList();\r\n        }\r\n     }\r\n\r\n    public interface CustomCarRepository { \r\n         List&lt;CarEntity&gt; findCarsWithSpeed(Integer speed);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen you can autowire in your other components the `CustomCarRepository` and access the data layer as you have implemented.\r\n\r\nWhen Not to use `@Repository`\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you just declare your interface and you extend from any Spring child interface of `Repository` from `org.springframework.data.repository`.\r\n\r\nExample \r\n\r\n    public interface CarRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;CarEntity, Long&gt; {\r\n        List&lt;CarEntity&gt; findCarsWithSpeed(Integer speed);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn that case `Spring Boot` will be able to create the repository bean for you automatically from `auto configuration`.\r\n\r\nThe only further action needed is if your own interfaces extending from `Repository` do not exist in the same package or subpackage of where your `@Configuration` or `@SpringBootApplication` exists then you would need\r\n\r\n  *  either `@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = {&quot;base-package-where-repositories-exist&quot;})`\r\n  * or `@AutoConfigurationPackage(basePackages = {&quot;base-package-where-repositories-exist&quot;})`\r\n\r\nas to help spring boot identify the package it should look for the auto configuration of that repository.

In this case marking your implementation class with <code>@Repository</code> will allow you to have this class managed by spring so that you can autowire necessary fields to access data layer like <code>EntityManager</code> , <code>JdbcTemplate</code> ...etc. Although <code>Component</code>, and <code>@Repository</code> in the most fundamental level just register spring beans there are some slight enhancements using <code>@Repository</code> which might make it neccessary to use and also best practice in the current case.</p>\n<p>As per <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Repository.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">doc1</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A class thus annotated with <code>@Repository</code> is eligible for Spring\nDataAccessException translation when used in conjunction with a\nPersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor.,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/dao/annotation/PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">doc2</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor</p>\n<p>Bean post-processor that\nautomatically applies persistence exception translation to any bean\nmarked with Spring's @Repository annotation, adding a corresponding\nPersistenceExceptionTranslationAdvisor to the exposed proxy</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Example of above case use with <code>@Repository</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>@Repository\npublic class CustomCarRepositoryImpl implements CustomCarRepository {\n\n    @PersistenceContext\n    private EntityManager entityManager;\n\n    @Override\n    public List&lt;CarEntity&gt; findCarsWithSpeed(Integer speed) {\n\n        return entityManager.createQuery(&quot;Query to execute&quot;)\n                .setMaxResults(50).getResultList();\n    }\n }\n\npublic interface CustomCarRepository { \n     List&lt;CarEntity&gt; findCarsWithSpeed(Integer speed);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then you can autowire in your other components the <code>CustomCarRepository</code> and access the data layer as you have implemented.</p>\n<h2>When Not to use <code>@Repository</code></h2>\n<p>When you just declare your interface and you extend from any Spring child interface of <code>Repository</code> from <code>org.springframework.data.repository</code>.</p>\n<p>Example</p>\n<pre><code>public interface CarRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;CarEntity, Long&gt; {\n    List&lt;CarEntity&gt; findCarsWithSpeed(Integer speed);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In that case <code>Spring Boot</code> will be able to create the repository bean for you automatically from <code>auto configuration</code>.</p>\n<p>The only further action needed is if your own interfaces extending from <code>Repository</code> do not exist in the same package or subpackage of where your <code>@Configuration</code> or <code>@SpringBootApplication</code> exists then you would need</p>\n<ul>\n<li>either <code>@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = {&quot;base-package-where-repositories-exist&quot;})</code></li>\n<li>or <code>@AutoConfigurationPackage(basePackages = {&quot;base-package-where-repositories-exist&quot;})</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>as to help spring boot identify the package it should look for the auto configuration of that repository.

The following was what I came up with, though it doesn&#39;t work with LuaJ. However, it can be easily modified to do its job in pure Lua. I may be switching to a Python binding for Java since LuaJ threading is so problematic.\r\n\r\n***--- I came up with the following, but it doesn&#39;t work with LuaJ ---***\r\n\r\n[Here][1] is a possible solution. I register a hook with debug.sethook that gets triggered on &quot;count&quot; events (these events occur even in a `while true do end`). I also pass a custom &quot;ScriptState&quot; Java object I created which contains a boolean flag indicating whether the script should terminate or not. The Java object is queried in the Lua hook &lt;s&gt;which will throw an error to close the script if the flag is set&lt;/s&gt; **(edit: throwing an error doesn&#39;t actually terminate the script)**. The terminate flag may also be set from inside the Lua script.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to automatically terminate unyielding infinite loops, it&#39;s straightforward enough to implement a timer system which records the last time a call was made to the ScriptState, then automatically terminate the script if sufficient time passes without an API call **(edit: this only works if the thread can be interrupted)**. If you want to kill infinite loops but not interrupt certain blocking operations, you can adjust the ScriptState object to include other state information that allows you to temporarily pause auto-termination, etc.\r\n\r\nHere is my `interpreter.lua` which can be used to call another script and interrupt it if/when necessary.

I register a hook with debug.sethook that gets triggered on \"count\" events (these events occur even in a <code>while true do end</code>). I also pass a custom \"ScriptState\" Java object I created which contains a boolean flag indicating whether the script should terminate or not. The Java object is queried in the Lua hook <s>which will throw an error to close the script if the flag is set</s> <strong>(edit: throwing an error doesn't actually terminate the script)</strong>. The terminate flag may also be set from inside the Lua script.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to automatically terminate unyielding infinite loops, it's straightforward enough to implement a timer system which records the last time a call was made to the ScriptState, then automatically terminate the script if sufficient time passes without an API call <strong>(edit: this only works if the thread can be interrupted)</strong>. If you want to kill infinite loops but not interrupt certain blocking operations, you can adjust the ScriptState object to include other state information that allows you to temporarily pause auto-termination, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my <code>interpreter.lua</code> which can be used to call another script and interrupt it if/when necessary.
