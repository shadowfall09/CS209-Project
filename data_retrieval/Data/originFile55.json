It results because you are attempting to search for, presumably, a `String`, but each element of `data` is *not* a `String`. Each element is another `Vector`. The `data` variable is essentially a 2D Vector. Thus, `data.contains(pn)` is searching for a `String` that is the same as a row of `Vectors`, so will always return `false`. \r\n\r\nAn analogy: Think of `data` as a case. The case contains some number of boxes of candy. But, the lists of types of candy is missing. You want to find whether or not the case contains any caramel candy. The code in the question using `data.contains(pn)` is like going through the case, picking out one-box-at-a-time, and asking &quot;Is this *box* a piece of caramel?&quot; To find out if the case contains any caramel candy, you want to open each box, and then check each piece in that box.\r\n\r\nTo access a single element of a `Vector&lt;Vector&gt;`, you need to use two indexes. See the [example in the API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/table/DefaultTableModel.html#getDataVector--). \r\n\r\nSo, to search for a specific `String`, you need to search element-by-element with nested loops, or use `contains` within a loop.\r\n\r\nThe following method can be used to find the first location of an occurrence of a target `String.` This uses the `contains` method within a loop. It returns an `int []` with two elements: One for the outer index, the other for the inner index:\r\n\r\n````\r\npublic static int [] indexOf (Vector&lt;Vector&gt; theVector, String target) {\r\n    for (int outer = 0; outer &lt; theVector.size (); outer++) { \r\n        int inner = theVector.get(outer).indexOf (target);\r\n        if (inner &gt;= 0) { \r\n            return new int [] {outer, inner};\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return new int [] { -1, -1};\r\n}\r\n````\r\nFollowing is a refactored `indexOf (Vector&lt;Vector&gt; theVector, String target)` method. Instead of using `contains`, the code shows how each element might be accessed. The code uses some intermediate variables, which should make it easier to follow. \r\n\r\nIt also fixes another issue, which is explained after the code sample:\r\n\r\n````\r\npublic static int [] indexOf (Vector&lt;Vector&gt; vectorVector, String target) {\r\n    for (int outer = 0; outer &lt; vectorVector.size (); outer++) { \r\n        Vector rowVect = vectorVector.get(outer);\r\n        for (int inner = 0; inner &lt; rowVect.size(); inner++) {\r\n            Object obj = rowVect.get(inner);\r\n            if (obj.toString().equalsIgnoreCase (target)) {\r\n                return new int [] { outer, inner};\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return new int [] { -1, -1};\r\n}\r\n````\r\nThe other issues is this:\r\n\r\nAn element of `JTable` does not necessarily have to be a `String`. So, it isn&#39;t necessarily the case that each element of `data` is a `String`. An element of `data` might be, hypothetically, a `Foo`. Suppose your code is looking for an element of `data` that corresponds to `&quot;Eleven&quot;`. It so happens, the `Eleven` is actually associated with the `Foo`, because its `toString()` method returns `&quot;Eleven&quot;`. The first version won&#39;t work. The refactored version solves this by using `String#equals` method. \r\n\r\nNote that the refactored version actually uses `.equalsIgnoreCase` to illustrate the revision makes that possible.\r\n\r\nYour code has \r\n\r\n`System.out.println(data.contains(pn));`. \r\n\r\nYou could use the above method by changing that line to \r\n\r\n`System.out.println(indexOf (data, pn)[0] != -1);` \r\n\r\nWhen you develop more code, you could access the specific element like this:\r\n\r\n````\r\nint [] location = indexOf (data, pn);\r\nif (location [0] &gt;= 0) {\r\n    String foo = data.get(location[0]).get(location[1]);\r\n    ...\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"Conversion of Vector&lt;Vector&gt; to a String Array or a String[][]","body":"<p>You do indeed have a problem with using <code>contains</code> on your <code>data</code> Object.

Along the way, I\n  decided to add ODT support as well since I encountered the code too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":17734936,"reputation":440,"user_id":12876529,"display_name":"Sanjay Sahani"},"score":0,"creation_date":1620647907,"post_id":51907417,"comment_id":119254031,"body_markdown":"Does it uses itext internally?","body":"Does it uses itext internally?"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3346139,"reputation":14655,"user_id":2811258,"accept_rate":88,"display_name":"Johnny"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1534586529,"creation_date":1534586529,"answer_id":51907417,"question_id":3022376,"body_markdown":"You can use Cloudmersive native Java library.

Here is my code:</p>\n<pre><code>PublicClientApplication pca = PublicClientApplication.builder(clientId).\n                authority(authority).\n                build();\nSilentParameters silentParameters = SilentParameters.builder(Collections.singleton(fhirUrl), account).build();\nIAuthenticationResult result = pca.acquireTokenSilently(silentParameters).get();\nString token = result.accessToken();\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am having trouble what this <code>account</code> needs to be. I found that <code>PublicClientApplication</code> has <code>getAccounts</code>, but how can I save it in the first try? Do I need to use other parameters object to save token in cache, then use <code>SilentParameters</code>? Is my approach not correct in the first place?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","web-applications","trusted-web-activity","bubblewrap"],"owner":{"account_id":25334647,"reputation":19,"user_id":19153971,"display_name":"Arun Jojo"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1700234406,"creation_date":1700234406,"question_id":77502753,"body_markdown":"FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\r\n\r\n* What went wrong:\r\nunable to create native thread: possibly out of memory or process/resource limits reached\r\n\r\n\r\nbubblewrap build for Building the Android App\r\n\r\nTry:\r\nRun with --info or --debug option to get more log output.

Is there anyone facing similar problem with the newest version of the Springboot?\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YaN4L.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YaN4L.png\" alt=\"UI\" /></a></p>\n<p>Here is my security configuration:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Configuration\n@EnableWebSecurity\n@RequiredArgsConstructor\npublic class SecurityConfiguration extends WebMvcConfigurationSupport {\n    private final JwtAuthenticationFilter jwtAuthFilter;\n    private final AuthenticationProvider authenticationProvider;\n\n    private static final String[] URL_WHITELIST = {\n            ApplicationConstants.AUTH + &quot;/**&quot;,\n            ApplicationConstants.PARKING_SPOT + ID,\n            &quot;/error&quot;,\n            &quot;/favicon.ico&quot;,\n            &quot;/swagger-resources&quot;,\n            &quot;/swagger-resources/**&quot;,\n            &quot;/configuration/ui&quot;,\n            &quot;/configuration/security&quot;,\n            &quot;/swagger-ui.html&quot;,\n            &quot;/webjars/**&quot;,\n            &quot;/v3/api-docs/**&quot;,\n            &quot;/api/public/**&quot;,\n            &quot;/api/public/authenticate&quot;,\n            &quot;/actuator/*&quot;,\n            &quot;/swagger-ui/**&quot;\n    };\n\n    @Bean\n    public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\n        http\n                .csrf(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable)\n                .authorizeHttpRequests(authorize -&gt; authorize\n                        .requestMatchers(URL_WHITELIST)\n                        .permitAll()\n                        .anyRequest()\n                        .authenticated())\n                .sessionManagement(session -&gt; session.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS))\n                .authenticationProvider(authenticationProvider)\n                .addFilterBefore(jwtAuthFilter, UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);\n        return http.build();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And OpenAPI initialization:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>\n@Configuration\npublic class OpenApiConfiguration {\n    @Bean\n    public OpenAPI openAPI() {\n        Info info = new Info()\n                .title(&quot;ParkingTime API&quot;)\n                .version(&quot;1.0&quot;);\n        return new OpenAPI().info(info);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Pom:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springdoc&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;version&gt;2.2.0&lt;/version&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;io.swagger.core.v3&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;swagger-annotations&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;version&gt;2.2.18&lt;/version&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>console:</p>\n<pre><code>2023-11-17T10:56:36.805+01:00  WARN 8272 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] o.s.web.servlet.PageNotFound             : No mapping for GET /swagger-ui/index.html\n2023-11-17T10:56:37.440+01:00  WARN 8272 --- [nio-8080-exec-2] o.s.web.servlet.PageNotFound             : No mapping for GET /swagger-ui/index.html\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","mysql","spring","jpa","geojson"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":8582865,"reputation":4145,"user_id":6474292,"accept_rate":56,"display_name":"David"},"score":1,"creation_date":1664088740,"post_id":73832173,"comment_id":130388249,"body_markdown":"Thanks a lot @Anish B. worked like charm.

Converts a geometry in Well-Known Text format to a Geometry.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; WKTReader supports extracting Geometry objects from either Readers or\r\n&gt; Strings. This allows it to function as a parser to read Geometry\r\n&gt; objects from text blocks embedded in other data formats (e.g. XML).\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; A WKTReader is parameterized by a GeometryFactory, to allow it to\r\n&gt; create Geometry objects of the appropriate implementation. In\r\n&gt; particular, the GeometryFactory determines the PrecisionModel and SRID\r\n&gt; that is used.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The WKTReader converts all input numbers to the precise internal\r\n&gt; representation.\r\n\r\nAccording to [WKTReader.read(String wellKnownText)][5] docs :\r\n\r\n&gt; It reads a Well-Known Text representation of a Geometry from a String.\r\n\r\nThis SQL statement `ST_GeomFromText(&#39;POLYGON((0 1, 2 5, 2 7, 0 7, 0 1))&#39;)` is equivalent to this line `Geometry geometry = wktReader.read(&quot;POLYGON((0 1, 2 5, 2 7, 0 7, 0 1))&quot;);`\r\n\r\nAs soon as, I have ran the example, it saved successfully without any issues.\r\n\r\nServer log screenshot :\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][6]][6]\r\n\r\nDB row screenshot :\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][7]][7]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/9GCUT.png\r\n  [2]: https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/5.3/javadocs/org/hibernate/spatial/dialect/mysql/MySQL5SpatialDialect.html\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/I737I.png\r\n  [4]: https://locationtech.github.io/jts/javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/io/WKTReader.html\r\n  [5]: https://locationtech.github.io/jts/javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/io/WKTReader.html#read-java.io.Reader-\r\n  [6]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/eCLch.jpg\r\n  [7]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/wiWN7.png","title":"Can not resolve &#39;ST_GeomFromText&#39;

Soft delete refers to marking an entity as deleted without physically removing it from the database. Instead of deleting the record permanently, you update a special flag or field to indicate that the entity has been &quot;soft deleted.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe `Version` field in JPA is typically used for optimistic locking, which helps avoid data conflicts in concurrent environments. However, you can also leverage this field for soft delete purposes, depending on your specific use case.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s how you can achieve soft delete using JPA and the `Version` field:\r\n\r\n1. Add a `@Version` annotation to the field that you want to use for optimistic locking. For example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Entity\r\npublic class YourEntity {\r\n    // Other entity fields\r\n\r\n    @Version\r\n    private Long version;\r\n\r\n    // Getter and setter methods\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Introduce a new field to indicate whether the entity has been deleted, along with getter and setter methods:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Entity\r\npublic class YourEntity {\r\n    // Other entity fields\r\n\r\n    @Version\r\n    private Long version;\r\n\r\n    private boolean deleted;\r\n\r\n    // Getter and setter methods for &#39;deleted&#39;\r\n    public boolean isDeleted() {\r\n        return deleted;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setDeleted(boolean deleted) {\r\n        this.deleted = deleted;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. When you want to perform a soft delete, instead of removing the entity, set the `deleted` field to `true` and update the entity using the JPA EntityManager:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nYourEntity entity = entityManager.find(YourEntity.class, entityId);\r\nentity.setDeleted(true);\r\nentityManager.merge(entity); // Use merge() to update the entity.\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Make sure to handle soft-deleted entities appropriately in your application logic to exclude them from regular queries if needed.\r\n\r\nBy using this approach, you can maintain a &quot;soft-deleted&quot; state for your entities while still utilizing the `Version` field for optimistic locking purposes. Remember to consider the implications of soft deletes on your application&#39;s behavior, including how to handle queries, cascading operations, and potential data retention policies.","title":"Is there any way we can perform soft delete in JPA when Entity class is using @Version?","body":"<p>Yes, it is possible to perform a soft delete in JPA (Java Persistence API) while using a <code>Version</code> field in the entity class.

`micrometer-registry-cloudwatch2` package because it conflicts wtih `micrometer-core:1.11.5` which is included with the latest version of `spring-boot-starter-actuator` This is the only conflict I can see in the micrometer cloudwatch package.  \r\nHow can I fix this, the error is below: \r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Error processing condition on

method, if it&#39;s for the same device, so you would either need to define another &#39;device&#39; (/might be good to try as an alternative/easier? starting-point test), or as you&#39;ve done try using another device (- unless I&#39;m wrong I&#39;m not sure why this API does not appear to have a &#39;client&#39;-only class / you seem to have to use a &#39;device&#39; as being the client).\r\n\r\nBut I&#39;m guessing the problem with you set-up, might be the (local/&#39;255.255.255.255&#39;) &#39;Who-Is&#39; broadcast, whereby it&#39;s only going to broadcast to the local subnet, and to devices that are using the same port #; so in terms of orchestrating that, you&#39;d probably be better off using the IPv4 (only) range of addresses (- IPv6 is cack in this regard in that they&#39;ve reduced the localhost to being only 1 address rather than like IPv4 a localhost range of addresses or even 5-10 addresses?!), so you can have both the client and server device listening upon the same (Class &#39;A&#39;) network but with the same port #.\r\n\r\nIgnoring the fact that I seem to have a newer(?) version of the BACnet4J library, i.e. method-names differences:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\t\tIpNetwork network =\r\n\t\t\t\tnew IpNetworkBuilder()\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t.localBindAddress(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t.port(47810)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t.subnetMask(hostAddress)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t.build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nE.g.

so in terms of orchestrating that, you'd probably be better off using the IPv4 (only) range of addresses (- IPv6 is cack in this regard in that they've reduced the localhost to being only 1 address rather than like IPv4 a localhost range of addresses or even 5-10 addresses?!), so you can have both the client and server device listening upon the same (Class 'A') network but with the same port #.</p>\n<p>Ignoring the fact that I seem to have a newer(?) version of the BACnet4J library, i.e. method-names differences:</p>\n<pre><code>            IpNetwork network =\n                new IpNetworkBuilder()\n                        .localBindAddress(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;)\n                        .port(47810)\n                        .subnetMask(hostAddress)\n                        .build();\n</code></pre>\n<p>E.g.

The vendor-specific JDBC driver is a concrete implementation of the [JDBC API][3] ([tutorial here][4]). \r\n\r\n    If you&#39;re using an IDE like Eclipse or Netbeans, then you can add it to the classpath by adding the JAR file as *Library* to the *Build Path* in project&#39;s properties. \r\n\r\n    If you&#39;re doing it &quot;plain vanilla&quot; in the command console, then you need to specify the path to the JAR file in the `-cp` or `-classpath` argument when executing your Java application.\r\n\r\n    &lt;pre&gt;java -cp .;/path/to/mysql-connector.jar com.example.YourClass&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n    The `.` is just there to add the *current* directory to the classpath as well so that it can locate `com.example.YourClass` and the `;` is the classpath separator as it is in Windows.

The better practice is to install the physical JDBC driver JAR file in the server itself and configure the server to create a JDBC connection pool. Here&#39;s an example for Tomcat: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2299469/how-should-i-connect-to-jdbc-database-datasource-in-a-servlet-based-applicatio/2299870#2299870\r\n\r\n0. **Create a [database][5] in MySQL**. Let&#39;s create a database `javabase`. You of course want World Domination, so let&#39;s use UTF-8 as well.\r\n\r\n        CREATE DATABASE javabase DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;\r\n\r\n0. **[Create a user][6] for Java and [grant][7] it access**. Simply because using `root` is a bad practice.\r\n\r\n        CREATE USER &#39;java&#39;@&#39;localhost&#39; IDENTIFIED BY &#39;password&#39;;\r\n        GRANT ALL ON javabase.* TO &#39;java&#39;@&#39;localhost&#39; IDENTIFIED BY &#39;password&#39;;\r\n\r\n    Yes, `java` is the username and `password` is the password here.\r\n\r\n0. **[Determine][8] the JDBC URL**. To connect the MySQL database using Java you need an JDBC URL in the following syntax:\r\n\r\n    &lt;pre&gt;jdbc:mysql://hostname:port/databasename&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n    - **`hostname`**: The hostname where MySQL server is installed. If it&#39;s installed at the same machine where you run the Java code, then you can just use `localhost`. It can also be an IP address like `127.0.0.1`. If you encounter connectivity problems and using `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` solved it, then you&#39;ve a problem in your network/DNS/hosts config.\r\n\r\n    - **`port`**: The TCP/IP port where MySQL server listens on. This is by default `3306`.\r\n\r\n    - **`databasename`**: The name of the database you&#39;d like to connect to. That&#39;s `javabase`.\r\n\r\n    So the final URL should look like:\r\n\r\n    &lt;pre&gt;jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/javabase&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n0. **[Test the connection][9] to MySQL using Java**. Create a simple Java class with a `main()` method to test the connection. \r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- language: java --&gt;\r\n\r\n        String url = &quot;jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/javabase&quot;;\r\n        String username = &quot;java&quot;;\r\n        String password = &quot;password&quot;;\r\n        \r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Connecting database ...&quot;);\r\n\r\n        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password)) {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Database connected!&quot;);\r\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\r\n            throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;Cannot connect the database!&quot;, e);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    If you get a `SQLException: No suitable driver`, then it means that either the JDBC driver wasn&#39;t autoloaded at all or that the JDBC URL is wrong (i.e. it wasn&#39;t recognized by any of the loaded drivers). See also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1911253/the-infamous-java-sql-sqlexception-no-suitable-driver-found/1911487#1911487. Normally, a JDBC 4.0 driver should be autoloaded when you just drop it in runtime classpath. To exclude one and other, you can always manually load it as below:\r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- language: java --&gt;\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Loading driver ...&quot;);\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n            Class.forName(&quot;com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver&quot;); // Use com.mysql.jdbc.Driver if you&#39;re not on MySQL 8+ yet.\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Driver loaded!&quot;);\r\n        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {\r\n            throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;Cannot find the driver in the classpath!&quot;, e);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    Note that the `newInstance()` call is **not** needed here. It&#39;s in case of MySQL just to fix the old and buggy `org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver`. [Explanation here][10]. If this line throws `ClassNotFoundException`, then the JAR file containing the JDBC driver class is simply not been placed in the classpath. Please also note that it&#39;s very important to throw an exception so that the code execution is immediately blocked, instead of suppressing it of merely printing the stack trace and then continuing the rest of the code.\r\n\r\n    Also note that you don&#39;t need to load the driver **everytime** *before* connecting. Just only once during application startup is enough.\r\n\r\n    If you get a `SQLException: Connection refused` or `Connection timed out` or a MySQL specific `CommunicationsException: \r\nCommunications link failure`, then it means that the DB isn&#39;t reachable at all. This can have one or more of the following causes:\r\n\r\n    1. IP address or hostname in JDBC URL is wrong.\r\n    2. Hostname in JDBC URL is not recognized by local DNS server.\r\n    3. Port number is missing or wrong in JDBC URL.\r\n    4. DB server is down.\r\n    5. DB server doesn&#39;t accept TCP/IP connections.\r\n    6. DB server has run out of connections.\r\n    7. Something in between Java and DB is blocking connections, e.g. a firewall or proxy.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n    To solve the one or the other, follow the following advices:\r\n\r\n    1. Verify and test them with `ping`.\r\n    2. Refresh DNS or use IP address in JDBC URL instead.\r\n    3. Verify it based on `my.cnf` of MySQL DB.\r\n    4. Start the DB.\r\n    5. Verify if mysqld is started without the `--skip-networking option`.\r\n    6. Restart the DB and fix your code accordingly that it closes connections in `finally`.\r\n    7. Disable firewall and/or configure firewall/proxy to allow/forward the port.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n    Note that closing the `Connection` is **extremely** important. If you don&#39;t close connections and keep getting a lot of them in a short time, then the database may run out of connections and your application may break. Always acquire the `Connection` in a [`try-with-resources` statement][11]. This also applies to `Statement`, `PreparedStatement` and `ResultSet`. See also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5602772/how-often-should-connection-statement-and-resultset-be-closed-in-jdbc/5602821#5602821\r\n\r\nThat was it as far the connectivity concerns. You can find [here][12] a more advanced tutorial how to load and store fullworthy Java model objects in a database with help of a basic DAO class.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nUsing a Singleton Pattern and/or a `static` variable for the DB `Connection` is a **bad practice**.

If you encounter connectivity problems and using <code>127.0.0.1</code> instead of <code>localhost</code> solved it, then you've a problem in your network/DNS/hosts config.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong><code>port</code></strong>: The TCP/IP port where MySQL server listens on. This is by default <code>3306</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong><code>databasename</code></strong>: The name of the database you'd like to connect to. That's <code>javabase</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So the final URL should look like:</p>\n <pre>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/javabase</pre>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/en/connector-j-usagenotes-basic.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Test the connection</a> to MySQL using Java</strong>. Create a simple Java class with a <code>main()</code> method to test the connection.</p>\n <pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code> String url = &quot;jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/javabase&quot;;\n String username = &quot;java&quot;;\n String password = &quot;password&quot;;\n\n System.out.println(&quot;Connecting database ...&quot;);\n\n try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password)) {\n     System.out.println(&quot;Database connected!&quot;);\n } catch (SQLException e) {\n     throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;Cannot connect the database!&quot;, e);\n }\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you get a <code>SQLException: No suitable driver</code>, then it means that either the JDBC driver wasn't autoloaded at all or that the JDBC URL is wrong (i.e. it wasn't recognized by any of the loaded drivers). See also <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1911253/the-infamous-java-sql-sqlexception-no-suitable-driver-found/1911487#1911487\">The infamous java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found</a>. Normally, a JDBC 4.0 driver should be autoloaded when you just drop it in runtime classpath. To exclude one and other, you can always manually load it as below:</p>\n <pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code> System.out.println(&quot;Loading driver ...&quot;);\n\n try {\n     Class.forName(&quot;com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver&quot;); // Use com.mysql.jdbc.Driver if you're not on MySQL 8+ yet.\n     System.out.println(&quot;Driver loaded!&quot;);\n } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {\n     throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;Cannot find the driver in the classpath!&quot;, e);\n }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the <code>newInstance()</code> call is <strong>not</strong> needed here. It's in case of MySQL just to fix the old and buggy <code>org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver</code>. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2092659/what-is-difference-between-class-forname-and-class-forname-newinstance/2093236#2093236\">Explanation here</a>. If this line throws <code>ClassNotFoundException</code>, then the JAR file containing the JDBC driver class is simply not been placed in the classpath. Please also note that it's very important to throw an exception so that the code execution is immediately blocked, instead of suppressing it of merely printing the stack trace and then continuing the rest of the code.</p>\n<p>Also note that you don't need to load the driver <strong>everytime</strong> <em>before</em> connecting. Just only once during application startup is enough.</p>\n<p>If you get a <code>SQLException: Connection refused</code> or <code>Connection timed out</code> or a MySQL specific <code>CommunicationsException:  Communications link failure</code>, then it means that the DB isn't reachable at all. This can have one or more of the following causes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>IP address or hostname in JDBC URL is wrong.</li>\n<li>Hostname in JDBC URL is not recognized by local DNS server.</li>\n<li>Port number is missing or wrong in JDBC URL.</li>\n<li>DB server is down.</li>\n<li>DB server doesn't accept TCP/IP connections.</li>\n<li>DB server has run out of connections.</li>\n<li>Something in between Java and DB is blocking connections, e.g. a firewall or proxy.\n<br><br></li>\n</ol>\n<p>To solve the one or the other, follow the following advices:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Verify and test them with <code>ping</code>.</li>\n<li>Refresh DNS or use IP address in JDBC URL instead.</li>\n<li>Verify it based on <code>my.cnf</code> of MySQL DB.</li>\n<li>Start the DB.</li>\n<li>Verify if mysqld is started without the <code>--skip-networking option</code>.</li>\n<li>Restart the DB and fix your code accordingly that it closes connections in <code>finally</code>.</li>\n<li>Disable firewall and/or configure firewall/proxy to allow/forward the port.\n<br><br></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that closing the <code>Connection</code> is <strong>extremely</strong> important. If you don't close connections and keep getting a lot of them in a short time, then the database may run out of connections and your application may break. Always acquire the <code>Connection</code> in a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>try-with-resources</code> statement</a>. This also applies to <code>Statement</code>, <code>PreparedStatement</code> and <code>ResultSet</code>. See also <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5602772/how-often-should-connection-statement-and-resultset-be-closed-in-jdbc/5602821#5602821\">How often should Connection, Statement and ResultSet be closed in JDBC?</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That was it as far the connectivity concerns.

Capture Conversion\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Let G name a generic type declaration (&#167;8.1.2, &#167;9.1.2) with n type parameters A1,...,An with corresponding bounds U1,...,Un.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; There exists a capture conversion from a parameterized type G&lt;T1,...,Tn&gt; (&#167;4.5) to a parameterized type G&lt;S1,...,Sn&gt;, where, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n :\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;    * If Ti is a wildcard type argument (&#167;4.5.1) of the form ?, then Si is a fresh type variable whose upper bound is Ui[A1:=S1,...,An:=Sn] and whose lower bound is the null type (&#167;4.1).\r\n&gt;    * ...\r\n\r\nWe can apply this to your example:\r\n\r\n    public Integer accept(RecipientTypeVisitor&lt;?&gt; visitor){ //Error:\r\n        return visitor.visit(this);             //Cannot convert capture of #1 to Integer\r\n    }\r\n\r\nA capture of the type parameter of `RecipientTypeVisitor` is introduced during compilation. The captured type parameter is concrete but totally unknown (the JLS calls this a &quot;fresh type variable&quot;), and certainly not convertible to `Integer`.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to denote the capture of a wildcard type directly, so you can&#39;t declare variables of that type or do much with it. You can however get a name for it indirectly by calling a generic method with it as a parameter.

Capture Conversion</p>\n  \n  <p>Let G name a generic type declaration (§8.1.2, §9.1.2) with n type parameters A1,...,An with corresponding bounds U1,...,Un.</p>\n  \n  <p>There exists a capture conversion from a parameterized type G (§4.5) to a parameterized type G, where, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n :</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>If Ti is a wildcard type argument (§4.5.1) of the form ?, then Si is a fresh type variable whose upper bound is Ui[A1:=S1,...,An:=Sn] and whose lower bound is the null type (§4.1).</li>\n  <li>...</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We can apply this to your example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public Integer accept(RecipientTypeVisitor&lt;?&gt; visitor){ //Error:\n    return visitor.visit(this);             //Cannot convert capture of #1 to Integer\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A capture of the type parameter of <code>RecipientTypeVisitor</code> is introduced during compilation. The captured type parameter is concrete but totally unknown (the JLS calls this a \"fresh type variable\"), and certainly not convertible to <code>Integer</code>.</p>\n\n<p>There is no way to denote the capture of a wildcard type directly, so you can't declare variables of that type or do much with it. You can however get a name for it indirectly by calling a generic method with it as a parameter. The JLS section I cited has a nice example of this further down:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>public static void reverse(List&lt;?&gt; list) { rev(list); }\nprivate static &lt;T&gt; void rev(List&lt;T&gt; list) {\n    List&lt;T&gt; tmp = new ArrayList&lt;T&gt;(list);\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.size(); i++) {\n        list.set(i, tmp.get(list.size() - i - 1));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1464103,"reputation":2882,"user_id":1377498,"accept_rate":88,"display_name":"Muhammad Suleman"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1434095841,"creation_date":1434095841,"answer_id":30798081,"question_id":30797805,"body_markdown":"The char `?` is a wildcard meaning you don&#39;t know the type. its doesn&#39;t mean its type is `Object` its by definition `undefined` but in Java you can hold any type of object in `Object` type.\r\n\r\n    ArrayList&lt;?&gt; list1 = new Arraylist&lt;?&gt;(); // list of undefined objects\r\n\r\nYou cannot add objects in list1, but after casting you can.\r\n\r\n    ArrayList&lt;Object&gt; list2 = new Arraylist&lt;Object&gt;(); // list of objects of type Object\r\n\r\nYou can add objects in list2 of any type","title":"Understanding a captured type in Java (symbol &#39;?&#39;)","body":"<p>The char <code>?</code> is a wildcard meaning you don't know the type. its doesn't mean its type is <code>Object</code> its by definition <code>undefined</code> but in Java you can hold any type of object in <code>Object</code> type.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ArrayList&lt;?&gt; list1 = new Arraylist&lt;?&gt;(); // list of undefined objects\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You cannot add objects in list1, but after casting you can.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ArrayList&lt;Object&gt; list2 = new Arraylist&lt;Object&gt;(); // list of objects of type Object\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can add objects in list2 of any type</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2478127,"reputation":19514,"user_id":2158288,"display_name":"ZhongYu"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1434114388,"creation_date":1434114388,"answer_id":30803874,"question_id":30797805,"body_markdown":"(This is from another answer of mine, but it is more suitable for this question, explaning wildcard itself)\r\n\r\nA wildcard `?` is **not a type**.
