So, `LocalDate.parse(&quot;2023-07-16&quot;)` will work without requiring a `DateTimeFormatter`.\r\n 2. You do not need to specify a time as a `String` (i.e. `&quot;15:00&quot;`) and then format it; you can directly use time units e.g. `LocalTime.of(15, 0)`.\r\n 3.

Yup that&#39;s\r\n&gt; right, our beloved Kotlin still has to be Java to compile for our\r\n&gt; beloved ART virtual machine. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Then it runs through and does the adapters that you have created for\r\n&gt; JVM Statics and a few other tasks.\r\n&gt; Next up it compiles all the xml databinding files first to create the\r\n&gt; generated databinding files. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; If everything succeeds it moves on to processing the assets and\r\n&gt; resources. Which creates pointers or IDs for each resource that you\r\n&gt; reference in code.    Next it will run through and begin compiling the\r\n&gt; code and packaging process after that.\r\n\r\nPretty straight forward process, but here in lies the problem.\r\n\r\n***The misleading Error***\r\n\r\nIf any step fails before the R generation is complete, then the R does not get generated. Sometimes a simple rebuild is all you need to do, sometimes a simple File-&gt;Invalidate Cache and Restart is all you need. However, more often than not you have a code issue in your gradle, your xml, your databinding or your adapters that are preventing the compiler from even reaching the R generation stage.\r\n\r\n**So the next question is**  \r\n\r\n&gt; &quot;Well shoot, how do we troubleshoot it if the errors are worthless or\r\n&gt; non-existent&quot;.\r\n\r\nWell first let&#39;s talk about the many ways these errors present themselves. \r\n\r\n - Duplicate Databinding class found\r\n - xml Binding Error at line #\r\n - Couldn&#39;t find matching signature of bind:customAdapterMethod\r\n - Can&#39;t find R file of the correct project, only shows import options for sub modules or incorrect namespace R files.\r\n - Couldn&#39;t find DataBindingUtility or DataBinding for activity/fragment\r\n - And many other various ways as well, too many to list them all\r\n\r\nNext, let&#39;s talk about potential candidates causing the problem. As there are sooo many lol.\r\n\r\n - Gradle Syncing issues \r\n - Bad versions of Gradle or Tools, you may have gone too far forward in your last gradle file modification. Try stepping back one version and &quot;invalidate cache and restart&quot; if that fixed it, great, if not, read on.\r\n - Caching Issues (File-&gt;Restart and Invalidate Cache)\r\n - xml elements with wrong namespace\r\n - xml elements with bad IDs or references IDs out of order (i.e. you say align to right of an element that is lower in the xml document then the sibling element that is trying to reference it)\r\n - xml data binding issues referencing namespace or member that doesn&#39;t exist or is not typed correctly\r\n - xml data binding issues in non-auto-filled spots like custom attributes using adapters as those are harder to spot. i.e. bind:myCustomMethod=@&quot;myObject.mistypedProperty()&quot;\r\n - JVM Static adapters with issues or duplicated signatures\r\n - Duplicated or bad character in the Strings or Dimens file or any other xml file for that matter\r\n - Private variable marked for @Binding without properties to access it\r\n - Member variable marked for @Binding that matches a parent class method causing duplications that manifests itself in almost impossible errors\r\n - Mismatch of types like using an adapter that takes (Int) but you are passing (Int?) via data binding and it isn&#39;t recognized with JVM Statics until compile time\r\n - You selected IMPORT on a popup to import R file of a sub module instead of the application file\r\n - Having bindable members in a child or parent class, but not giving fully qualified namespace to class cast in the XML usage of the parent or child class. As the databinding compiler is not smart enough to realize the variable provided for class Foo is also parentFoo baseclass, so you have to qualify it as android:text=&quot;@((com.path.parentFoo)foo).parentMethod&quot;\r\n - Having a method name in a class, that matches a &quot;generated property from @Binding member variable&quot; i.e. firstName as a variable, but then having a method called getFirstName in a parent or child class, because you are now matching a method name that will get auto generated, thus causing dataBindingUtility duplication class errors.\r\n - There are more causes, but this should give you a series of places to look, but the list can go on and on seriously.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this happens a lot in bleeding edge technologies where the UI tools are not up to speed with the terminal based tools yet. So I suggest you run from the project root in a terminal with\r\n\r\n    bash gradlew assembleDebug --debug\r\n\r\nWhen it fails, and it will. Start scrolling up through the logs until you find the red where you see what is actually failing and preventing the next stage from occurring.\r\n\r\nYou will find this especially useful when you start dealing with databinding.\r\n\r\n**TIP:**\r\n\r\nWhen you start dealing with databinding, make sure you compile and run often because the goal is to recognize right away before doing other files to make sure you didn&#39;t break generation and make your life MUCH easier to know code you just added caused the issue before getting too far. \r\n\r\nTimes to compile and run to confirm no issues before moving on.\r\n\r\n - If you add a few JVM statics compile and run\r\n - If you add variables to your XML to use\r\n - If you bind to properties of your model in 1 file\r\n - If you add a binding to a JVMStatic\r\n - If you add bindable members or properties to an model\r\n - If you refactor moving observable member variables or properties into children or base classes\r\n - Any other xml or binding related elements that can effect the generated code.\r\n\r\nLike I mentioned above, the reason is to avoid getting so many changes, that it becomes a troubleshooting nightmare to find a generic vague, horrible error related to generated databinding code. I&#39;m sure the tools will improve, but for now, do yourself a favor and compile and run often when changing Databinding related items.\r\n\r\nHappy Coding","title":"Android Studio 3.1.3 - Unresolved reference: R - Kotlin","body":"<p>So this is a misleading error.\nThe fastest way to get to the root cause is to run:</p>\n<pre><code>bash gradlew assembleDebug --debug\n</code></pre>\n<p>then scroll up and look for the real error happening.</p>\n<p>However, if it still doesn't seem like you have the answer you are looking for, then read on.</p>\n<p>I'm going to explain the 30,000 foot view of what is happening.

As there are sooo many lol.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gradle Syncing issues</li>\n<li>Bad versions of Gradle or Tools, you may have gone too far forward in your last gradle file modification. Try stepping back one version and &quot;invalidate cache and restart&quot; if that fixed it, great, if not, read on.</li>\n<li>Caching Issues (File-&gt;Restart and Invalidate Cache)</li>\n<li>xml elements with wrong namespace</li>\n<li>xml elements with bad IDs or references IDs out of order (i.e. you say align to right of an element that is lower in the xml document then the sibling element that is trying to reference it)</li>\n<li>xml data binding issues referencing namespace or member that doesn't exist or is not typed correctly</li>\n<li>xml data binding issues in non-auto-filled spots like custom attributes using adapters as those are harder to spot. i.e. bind:myCustomMethod=@&quot;myObject.mistypedProperty()&quot;</li>\n<li>JVM Static adapters with issues or duplicated signatures</li>\n<li>Duplicated or bad character in the Strings or Dimens file or any other xml file for that matter</li>\n<li>Private variable marked for @Binding without properties to access it</li>\n<li>Member variable marked for @Binding that matches a parent class method causing duplications that manifests itself in almost impossible errors</li>\n<li>Mismatch of types like using an adapter that takes (Int) but you are passing (Int?) via data binding and it isn't recognized with JVM Statics until compile time</li>\n<li>You selected IMPORT on a popup to import R file of a sub module instead of the application file</li>\n<li>Having bindable members in a child or parent class, but not giving fully qualified namespace to class cast in the XML usage of the parent or child class. As the databinding compiler is not smart enough to realize the variable provided for class Foo is also parentFoo baseclass, so you have to qualify it as android:text=&quot;@((com.path.parentFoo)foo).parentMethod&quot;</li>\n<li>Having a method name in a class, that matches a &quot;generated property from @Binding member variable&quot; i.e. firstName as a variable, but then having a method called getFirstName in a parent or child class, because you are now matching a method name that will get auto generated, thus causing dataBindingUtility duplication class errors.</li>\n<li>There are more causes, but this should give you a series of places to look, but the list can go on and on seriously.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately this happens a lot in bleeding edge technologies where the UI tools are not up to speed with the terminal based tools yet. So I suggest you run from the project root in a terminal with</p>\n<pre><code>bash gradlew assembleDebug --debug\n</code></pre>\n<p>When it fails, and it will. Start scrolling up through the logs until you find the red where you see what is actually failing and preventing the next stage from occurring.</p>\n<p>You will find this especially useful when you start dealing with databinding.</p>\n<p><strong>TIP:</strong></p>\n<p>When you start dealing with databinding, make sure you compile and run often because the goal is to recognize right away before doing other files to make sure you didn't break generation and make your life MUCH easier to know code you just added caused the issue before getting too far.</p>\n<p>Times to compile and run to confirm no issues before moving on.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you add a few JVM statics compile and run</li>\n<li>If you add variables to your XML to use</li>\n<li>If you bind to properties of your model in 1 file</li>\n<li>If you add a binding to a JVMStatic</li>\n<li>If you add bindable members or properties to an model</li>\n<li>If you refactor moving observable member variables or properties into children or base classes</li>\n<li>Any other xml or binding related elements that can effect the generated code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like I mentioned above, the reason is to avoid getting so many changes, that it becomes a troubleshooting nightmare to find a generic vague, horrible error related to generated databinding code. I'm sure the tools will improve, but for now, do yourself a favor and compile and run often when changing Databinding related items.</p>\n<p>Happy Coding</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":7785191,"reputation":1727,"user_id":5890321,"display_name":"Kenneth Argo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1542912407,"creation_date":1542912407,"answer_id":53436666,"question_id":51621301,"body_markdown":"I believe that I came across the real answer (though by accident).\r\n\r\nI also, as the OP had my KT file fail to location R. as well as other classes that happen to be in java.

Cleaning the project from time to time may save you some time, on Android Studio it would be something like this : `Build -&gt; Clean Project / Rebuild Project` **-** Cleaning IDE cash also helps with performance and memory, on Android Studio it would look like this : `File-&gt; Invalidate Chases/ Restart -&gt; Invalidate Cashes and Restart`\r\n - I noticed that this problem happens to me the most of the time when importing new resources, Using prohibited characters in their names would fire the error, such as `. , , - , UpperCase or special Letters`\r\n - And as a suggestion , if you&#39;re using **Kotlin**, i really recommend using Kotlin extensions in your activity such as : import `kotlinx.android.synthetic.main.activity_page.*` or if you&#39;re using a custom view : `kotlinx.android.synthetic.main.view_layout.view.*` \r\n**after that**, in onCreat() method of an activity , you&#39;ll only have to call the id, for example : `my_edit_text_ID.text = &quot;Kotlin Dbest!&quot;`, or from a custom view : `mCostumView.my_edit_text_ID.text = &quot;Kotlin Dbest!&quot;`\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT :**\r\n\r\n - I have faced this issue againe and the problem was the &#39;&#39; R &#39;&#39; library was imported from 2 different sources : \r\n\r\n       com.android.R\r\n    \r\n       com.example.package.R\r\n\r\n   You must only import the &#39;&#39; R &#39;&#39; library with your application package name, \r\n   in this case `com.example.package.R` \r\n   Sometimes the library is not imported at all, to import it, click on the \r\n   unresolved reference `R` and press `Alt + Enter`   \r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\n\r\nAs [tobltobs][2] mentioned in the comments section: &quot; Most of the time the problem is caused by another error which prevents the build system from creating generated sources.

Let me zoom in on the details....\r\n\r\nI&#39;m wanting to remove the rust from java and decided to study something different I took the opportunity to look for something challenging and that would make me learn a little about bitcoin as well, I ended up at an &quot;impasse&quot; ...\r\n\r\nPS: I imagine some will want to add recommendations like &quot;for mobile development nowadays we use kotlin&quot; or &quot;there is another bitcoin/java project better for that&quot; ... and I thank you in advance for such recommendation (I&#39;ll keep my track on this project still it is nice to know alternatives) and I&#39;d be happy if you add it as a comment to the thread (and not as an answer to the question). So in addition to being able to talk, it is possible it will be something useful for other people studying such stack. Thanks again. So ...\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to compile one **old version of schildbach wallet** (if I&#39;m not mistaken it was the first version of bitcoin wallet for android. It&#39;s an open-source project that seems to be very interesting and I decided to use it for my studies). AFAIK this 3.31 version is wide used to build a few other wallets to manage other coins. Don&#39;t ask me exactly why, but it seems to me this is one of the most used versions.\r\n\r\nI already managed to build the necessary JAR files, but when the environment builds the APK file (so that I can use it in the android simulator) it ends up not being able to generate the file. my guess is there is something missing on my sistem or it does not exists animore and should be changed on pom file as an workaround. Could someone please help me and point me out what I&#39;m doing wrong?\r\n\r\nPS: For knowledge, I&#39;ve been working with vanilla java for a long time, but I don&#39;t have much experience even in Android development. My experience in mobile is mobile qt, golang, webapps and recently what I most used java was with spring.\r\n\r\nAnd in case you are wandering ... yes I set a self signed truststore ssl certificate with keytool by now.\r\n\r\nTo build the environment (considering that it is a 2014 version) I ended up installing several **SDK Tools versions** in Android Studio, including those related to version 4 of Android Studio (which was the version used at the time and settled in maven).\r\n\r\nI&#39;m also using **Java version** 8 (from sdkman, the oldest I was able to use was &quot;8.0.265-open&quot; because it had already been installed on another computer, so I managed to bring it to the current machine, that is, I didn&#39;t install it it through &quot;sdk install java&quot;, I just rsynced from another machine and AFAIK it&#39;s basically the same that &quot;sdk install&quot; does). I made some attempts with java 6-zulu, 7-zulu, 16-open, 20-amzn and 22-open, but nothing encouraging, so I decided to go with 8.\r\n\r\nAs for **maven version**, I tried with &quot;3.2.2 &quot; and &quot;3.9.1&quot;, but the results are the same as the version &quot;3.8.1&quot; I&#39;m currently using.\r\n\r\nHere we have a link to the project version I am using right on github https://github.com/schildbach/bitcoin-wallet/tree/112b477201699e8389625add27c6ab8ed1353d22\r\n\r\nI made some changes in the wallet directory pom file because it seems to me since it is a very old code maven was not able to download some packages files ...\r\n\r\n(in wallet pom file) For the&#160;com.google.bitcoinj.* dependencies and for de.schildbach.wallet.integration.android.* I added the scope and the systemPath (I didn&#39;t understand why de.schildbach.wallet.integration.android.* generates errors being that the domain is in the same project, only in another module and bitcoinj I downloaded it in the project, compiled it in the appropriate version and added the jar in this project that I&#39;m trying to compile now).

It's an open-source project that seems to be very interesting and I decided to use it for my studies). AFAIK this 3.31 version is wide used to build a few other wallets to manage other coins. Don't ask me exactly why, but it seems to me this is one of the most used versions.</p>\n<p>I already managed to build the necessary JAR files, but when the environment builds the APK file (so that I can use it in the android simulator) it ends up not being able to generate the file. my guess is there is something missing on my sistem or it does not exists animore and should be changed on pom file as an workaround.

And since you must <code>exports</code> the application&#39;s package to at least that module, you are &quot;exporting&quot; an API where consumers would transitively require the <code>javafx.graphics</code> module."},{"owner":{"account_id":8532578,"reputation":39918,"user_id":6395627,"display_name":"Slaw"},"score":0,"creation_date":1689617800,"post_id":76701784,"comment_id":135236041,"body_markdown":"The &quot;fix&quot; is to have `requires transitive javafx.graphics` instead of just `requires javafx.graphics` (or in addition to e.g., `requires javafx.controls` if that&#39;s all you have; the controls module transitively requires the graphics module, hence why you don&#39;t need to explicitly require both to use types from both in _your own module_).

If you divide some activity in multiple threads and make it parallel, but wait for all the threads to complete, it is synchronous parallel.."},{"owner":{"account_id":3391382,"reputation":3687,"user_id":2846138,"display_name":"cyberbrain"},"score":3,"creation_date":1689579203,"post_id":76702295,"comment_id":135227757,"body_markdown":"&quot;and called join() on each thread&quot; - this is your synchronization code.","body":"&quot;and called join() on each thread&quot; - this is your synchronization code."},{"owner":{"account_id":23740623,"reputation":1,"user_id":17758716,"display_name":"Reilas"},"score":0,"creation_date":1689590255,"post_id":76702295,"comment_id":135229985,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m not sure it applies yet; I believe _synchronicity_ pertains to the communication of the data.

Then determine the path relative to the MyClass.class file and write that as a string value with \"dots\" and \"slashes\".  </p>\n\n<p>For example, here is how I make an app1.fxml file available to my javafx application where the relevant \"MyClass.class\" is implicitly \"Main.class\".  The Main.java file is where this line of resource-calling code is contained.  In my specific case the resources are copied to a location at the same level as the enclosing package folder. That is: /target/classes/pkg/Main.class and /target/classes/app1.fxml.  So paraphrasing...the relative reference \"../app1.fxml\" is \"start from Main.class, go up one directory level, now you can see the resource\".  </p>\n\n<pre><code>FXMLLoader loader = new FXMLLoader();\n        loader.setLocation(getClass().getResource(\"../app1.fxml\"));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that in this relative-path string \"../app1.fxml\", the first two dots reference the directory enclosing Main.class and the single \".\" indicates a file extension to follow.  After these details become second nature, you will forget why it was confusing.  </p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":15455548,"reputation":1412,"user_id":12485639,"display_name":"Omkar76"},"score":1,"creation_date":1597837542,"post_id":49736934,"comment_id":112262417,"body_markdown":"I found your answer most helpful.
