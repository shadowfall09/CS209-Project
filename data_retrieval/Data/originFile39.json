Signing the XML requires the library to create an xml fragment containing a digest for the canonical version of your XML.  The fragment is then signed and the result is another XML fragment.  In general they are independent in that as long as you don&#39;t change what makes an equivalent canonical xml but there are enough rules to make it difficult for the library to make it pretty when combined.

Because the XML file is now represented as Java objects.\r\n1) Usually, the content between `&gt;` and `&lt;`, like in this piece of `&lt;Item&gt;this is content&lt;/Item&gt;`, `this is content` is the payload, Does the signing process only sign the payload? or it will contain the `&lt;Item&gt;`, `&lt;\\Item&gt;`, even more it will include some blank space before the `&lt;Item&gt;` like `  &lt;Item&gt;` and some `\\n` in the end of `&lt;\\Item&gt;`?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/coheigea/testcases/blob/master/apache/santuario/santuario-xml-signature/src/test/java/org/apache/coheigea/santuario/xmlsignature/SignatureDOMTest.java#L41","title":"Signature validation failed after formatting an XML with SignatureValue on it","body":"<p>From <a href=\"https://github.com/coheigea/testcases/blob/master/apache/santuario/santuario-xml-signature/src/test/java/org/apache/coheigea/santuario/xmlsignature/SignatureDOMTest.java#L41\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">apache santuario xmlsignature test</a>,\nI do a test: add a signature to the XML file, then save it as a file, after that read it from that file, and verify the signature.\nPlease refer to the comments in the code.</p>\n<p>The plain xml file is :</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;PurchaseOrder xmlns=&quot;urn:example:po&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;Items&gt;\n    &lt;Item Code=&quot;001-001-001&quot; Quantity=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n      spade\n    &lt;/Item&gt;\n    &lt;Item Code=&quot;001-001-002&quot; Quantity=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n      shovel\n    &lt;/Item&gt;\n  &lt;/Items&gt;\n  &lt;ShippingAddress&gt;\n    Dig PLC, 1 First Ave, Dublin 1, Ireland\n  &lt;/ShippingAddress&gt;\n  &lt;PaymentInfo&gt;\n    &lt;BillingAddress&gt;\n      Dig PLC, 1 First Ave, Dublin 1, Ireland\n    &lt;/BillingAddress&gt;\n    &lt;CreditCard Type=&quot;Amex&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;Name&gt;Foo B Baz&lt;/Name&gt;\n      &lt;Number&gt;1234 567890 12345&lt;/Number&gt;\n      &lt;Expires Month=&quot;1&quot; Year=&quot;2005&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/CreditCard&gt;\n  &lt;/PaymentInfo&gt;\n&lt;/PurchaseOrder&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have some questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Verify the signature by using the cert in the XML.

There are far too many to review manually, thus, I selected those whose groupId and artifactId existed since at least three years and have been updated during the last year, in hope of finding projects that are maintained on the long run, which I suppose indicates more probably a good quality project. (Of course this filter may have missed good quality archetypes that perfectly match the stated goal; I have no way to know. As a case in point, this very archetype does not pass that filter as I have changed its artifactId over time.)\r\n\r\nI then filtered manually the resulting list on the basis of the archetypes descriptions found in their POM, and gave a further look (on the official website, typically) for a few promising archetypes among them. Only `com.github.ngeor:archetype-quickstart-jdk8` revealed to be a suitable candidate.

There are far too many to review manually, thus, I selected those whose groupId and artifactId existed since at least three years and have been updated during the last year, in hope of finding projects that are maintained on the long run, which I suppose indicates more probably a good quality project. (Of course this filter may have missed good quality archetypes that perfectly match the stated goal; I have no way to know. As a case in point, this very archetype does not pass that filter as I have changed its artifactId over time.)</p>\n<p>I then filtered manually the resulting list on the basis of the archetypes descriptions found in their POM, and gave a further look (on the official website, typically) for a few promising archetypes among them. Only <code>com.github.ngeor:archetype-quickstart-jdk8</code> revealed to be a suitable candidate. But its author wrote to me that he is “not really using/maintaing the archetype much these days”.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":4499761,"reputation":1809,"user_id":3658614,"display_name":"kate"},"score":0,"creation_date":1700816233,"post_id":76616459,"comment_id":136701918,"body_markdown":"thank you for the effort behind this great answer!!","body":"thank you for the effort behind this great answer!!"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":322981,"reputation":310755,"user_id":642706,"accept_rate":58,"display_name":"Basil Bourque"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1700844027,"creation_date":1688517397,"answer_id":76616459,"question_id":7158348,"body_markdown":"# Maven *Quickstart* Archetype\r\n\r\nAs others noted, the usual starting point for a simple Java app is the *QuickStart* archetype. \r\n\r\n - See [description][1]. \r\n - See [repository][2].\r\n\r\nProduces these folders and files:\r\n\r\n[![diagram of files and folders in a newly created project using QuickStart archetype][3]][3]\r\n\r\nFrom the command line in a console:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote there that 1.4 is the current version, as of 2023-07.\r\n\r\nIn the [*IntelliJ*][4] [IDE][5], start a new project as seen in this screenshot.\r\n\r\n[![screenshot of New Project dialog box in IntelliJ with QuickStart archetype selected][6]][6]\r\n\r\nChange the version from 1.1 to 1.4 (currently the latest).

Wait a moment as Maven does its job, expanding the archetype into a real project. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we are not ready to do our Java programming. The [`POM.xml`][9] file needs some tweaks. The QuickStart archetype, even in its latest version, is quite out-of-date with the versions of its various parts. In my experience, it is generally best to change all the versions to their respective latest.\r\n\r\nFirst, update the version of Java for your project. You should usually be using either:\r\n\r\n - One of the [LTS][10] versions: 8, 11, 17, 21.\r\n - The latest version: 21.\r\n\r\nAnd when specifying the Java version, in modern tooling we can replace the pair of `.source` &amp; `.target` tags with a single `.release` tag.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;maven.compiler.release&gt;21&lt;/maven.compiler.release&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nLoad that first change to the POM. In IntelliJ, look for the little floating windoid with the blue *M* logo. Click that logo. Otherwise, open the *Maven* panel within IntelliJ. Click the first icon for *Reload all Maven projects*. \r\n\r\nVerify that your project runs. Open the `App.java` file. Click the hollow green icon for a pop-up menu; choose `Run App.main()`. See that you get successful output in the console panel of the IDE.\r\n\r\nBack in the POM.xml, change from using JUnit 4 to using the JUnit 5 Jupiter technology. Replace the entire `&lt;dependency&gt;` tag for `junit` to the *JUnit Jupiter (Aggregator)* dependency. The *Aggregator* means that a few related dependencies are brought in for your convenience.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter --&gt;\r\n&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.junit.jupiter&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;junit-jupiter&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    &lt;version&gt;5.10.0-M1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nModernize the auto-generated `App.test` file to use JUnit 5 Jupiter. Replace both `import` lines with these:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\nimport static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;\r\n```\r\n\r\nClick the green hollow icon to choose `run shouldAnswerWithTrue()`.  Look for the green checkmarks in the *Run` panel of IntelliJ.\r\n\r\nNext we update the version numbers of the remaining parts. \r\n\r\nUpdate your local cache of Maven dependency data. In the IntelliJ settings, go to *Build, Execution, Deployment &gt; Build Tools &gt; Maven &gt; Repositories*. To quickly go there, just type `repo` in the Find field at top of the column in Settings. Once you have reached that panel, select each of the listed Maven repositories, and click the *Update* button. Performing the updates may take several minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter updating, you *may* see the latest version number by deleting the content of each `&lt;version&gt;` tag, and press *Control + Spacebar*. You may want to verify the actual latest numbers against a Maven repository’s web site.\r\n\r\nWhen done, you should have a POM that looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;project xmlns=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\r\n         xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;groupId&gt;work.basil.example&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;ExampleQS&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;name&gt;ExampleQS&lt;/name&gt;\r\n    &lt;!-- FIXME change it to the project&#39;s website --&gt;\r\n    &lt;url&gt;http://www.example.com&lt;/url&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;properties&gt;\r\n        &lt;project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;UTF-8&lt;/project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;\r\n        &lt;maven.compiler.release&gt;20&lt;/maven.compiler.release&gt;\r\n    &lt;/properties&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;dependencies&gt;\r\n        &lt;!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter --&gt;\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.junit.jupiter&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;junit-jupiter&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;5.10.0-M1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n            &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n    &lt;/dependencies&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;build&gt;\r\n        &lt;pluginManagement&gt;&lt;!-- lock down plugins versions to avoid using Maven defaults (may be moved to parent pom) --&gt;\r\n            &lt;plugins&gt;\r\n                &lt;!-- clean lifecycle, see https://maven.apache.org/ref/current/maven-core/lifecycles.html#clean_Lifecycle --&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-clean-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.2.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;!-- default lifecycle, jar packaging: see https://maven.apache.org/ref/current/maven-core/default-bindings.html#Plugin_bindings_for_jar_packaging --&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-resources-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.3.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-compiler-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.11.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-surefire-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.0.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-jar-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.3.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-install-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.1.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-deploy-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.1.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;!-- site lifecycle, see https://maven.apache.org/ref/current/maven-core/lifecycles.html#site_Lifecycle --&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-site-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;4.0.0-M3&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-project-info-reports-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.4.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n            &lt;/plugins&gt;\r\n        &lt;/pluginManagement&gt;\r\n    &lt;/build&gt;\r\n&lt;/project&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo a Maven *clean*. Run your app, and run your test. All should be well. You are now ready to start your Java programming.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis Answer uses *IntelliJ* as an example. You should be able to do something quite similar in other IDEs such as [*Eclipse*][11] or [*NetBeans*][12]. One of the main benefits of Maven (and alternatives such as [Gradle][13]) is that it works the same across various IDEs. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://maven.apache.org/archetypes/maven-archetype-quickstart/\r\n  [2]: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.maven.archetypes/maven-archetype-quickstart\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/yS5qo.png\r\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA\r\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\r\n  [6]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/0QCGR.png\r\n  [7]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/fGBJZ.png\r\n  [8]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/USq7U.png\r\n  [9]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven#Project_Object_Model\r\n  [10]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support\r\n  [11]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software)\r\n  [12]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBeans\r\n  [13]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradle","title":"What archetype to choose for a simple java project","body":"<h1>Maven <em>Quickstart</em> Archetype</h1>\n<p>As others noted, the usual starting point for a simple Java app is the <em>QuickStart</em> archetype.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>See <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/archetypes/maven-archetype-quickstart/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">description</a>.</li>\n<li>See <a href=\"https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.maven.archetypes/maven-archetype-quickstart\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">repository</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Produces these folders and files:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yS5qo.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yS5qo.png\" alt=\"diagram of files and folders in a newly created project using QuickStart archetype\" /></a></p>\n<p>From the command line in a console:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-bash prettyprint-override\"><code>mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note there that 1.4 is the current version, as of 2023-07.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>IntelliJ</em></a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">IDE</a>, start a new project as seen in this screenshot.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0QCGR.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0QCGR.png\" alt=\"screenshot of New Project dialog box in IntelliJ with QuickStart archetype selected\" /></a></p>\n<p>Change the version from 1.1 to 1.4 (currently the latest).

Got it working.\r\n\r\nFirstly: The best explanation I found for understanding Maven (that included a good example of multi-module projects) is here:\r\n[https://books.sonatype.com/mvnex-book/reference/index.html][1]\r\n\r\nIt is quite old, and the sample code wont work because it references APIs that no longer exist. However, the explanations are really clear and the sample code files still exist as a reference.\r\n\r\nMaybe if you know of more up-to-date references that are as good, you can put a comment below.\r\n\r\nFor other Java newbies I offer the following...\r\n\r\nThe final result was done partly using VSCode functionality and partly hand customised. If I understood the VSCode java extensions better maybe I could have done it all using the extensions.\r\n\r\nThe short version is as below and the resulting files and folders etc are shown further down.\r\n1. Create a new Java Project for the `parent`. Use the Maven quick-start archetype. For this sample I just used all the defaults, apart from my groupId, etc.\r\n2. Keep the `pom.xml` file and delete the rest.\r\n3. Add `&lt;packaging&gt;pom&lt;/packaging&gt;` to the `pom.xml` file as per example below.\r\n4. Inside the `parent` project, create the `shared` project, using the same groupId as the parent. When asked, add the project to the workspace. Delete the `App.java` file if you wish.\r\n5. In the `shared` pom.xml I removed the `&lt;groupId&gt;` section. Note that Maven includes the `&lt;parent&gt;` block.\r\n6. Inside the `parent` project, create the `mainapp` project, using the same groupId as the parent. When asked, add the project to the workspace.\r\n7. In the `mainapp` pom.xml I removed the `&lt;groupId&gt;` section. Note that Maven includes the `&lt;parent&gt;` block.\r\n8. In the `mainapp` pom.xml, add a `&lt;dependency&gt;` block for the `shared` project, as per example below.\r\n\r\n9. If you go back to the `parent` project&#39;s `pom.xml`, and scroll to the end, you should see that VSCode has added a block like this:\r\n```\r\n&lt;modules&gt;\r\n  &lt;module&gt;shared&lt;/module&gt;\r\n  &lt;module&gt;mainapp&lt;/module&gt;\r\n&lt;/modules&gt;\r\n```\r\nwhich you can move to the top to make it more visible.\r\n\r\n10. Add your test class (eg PrintMessage.java) to your `shared` project in its own folder (eg messaging).\r\n11. Update your `mainapp` `App.java` file to include your shared class as per the example.\r\n12. From the parent project root run `mvn clean install`. This adds the jars to the local Maven repo (the location of the local repo is as printed in the terminal output).\r\n\r\nAt this point I find I needed to close and reopen the VSCode window so that the Java Projects section sorts itself out and the 3 projects appear there. If I didn&#39;t do that I got &quot;classpath&quot; errors.\r\n\r\nThen, I could test by opening the `App.java` file and using VSCode to `Run java`. The terminal shows:\r\n```\r\nHello World!\r\nPrintMessage.echoMessage() echoed: I was called from Main app\r\n```\r\n\r\nI notice if I edit the `PrintMessage.java` file (eg change the output message) I can run the `App.java` file without recompiling and the change shows up. Cool.\r\n\r\n==== Code samples ====\r\n\r\n(I deleted the `src/test` and `target` folders for clarity)\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nThe `parent` pom.xml\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

Positions that you have visited, should not be visited again. This is a basic principle in search algorithms. A node is called &quot;visited&quot; when you are ready to look at its neighbors. As you make a recursive call for a neighbor, that neighbor gets visited. If that neighbor is found to already have been visited, that indicates that neighbor is on the path you have already traversed, and so it should not be visited again. If you would, you would run in cycles, which is the problem you have encountered.\r\n\r\nSo you need to maintain a visited status somewhere. There are many ways to do that. One is to add a boolean field to `Node`.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Node\r\n{\r\n    private int position;\r\n    private int type;\r\n    private boolean IsExit;\r\n    private boolean isVisited; // See also getter &amp; setter\r\n\r\n    public Node(int position,int type,boolean IsExit)\r\n    {\r\n        this.position = position;\r\n        this.type = type;\r\n        this.IsExit = IsExit;\r\n        this.isVisited = false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public int getPosition()\r\n    {\r\n        return position;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public int getType()\r\n    {\r\n        return type;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public boolean getIsExit()\r\n    {\r\n        return IsExit;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setIsExit(boolean b)\r\n    {\r\n        IsExit = b;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public boolean getIsVisited() {\r\n        return isVisited;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public void setIsVisited(boolean b) {\r\n        isVisited = b;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would also suggest to have `calc` return a `boolean` instead of `int`, since that is really what you do there: either the search succeeds, or it doesn&#39;t.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that the change you make to `position` just before making the recursive call, should be reverted once you are back. Otherwise the calculation for the next neighbor position will be wrong.\r\n\r\nSo for example this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    {\r\n        position[0]++;\r\n        calc(position);\r\n    }\r\n``` \r\n\r\nshould become:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n    {\r\n        position[0]++;\r\n        calc(position);\r\n        position[0]--; // Bring position back to the original\r\n    }\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThis is quite cumbersome.
