Although this question is technically correct, it is not correct for the lesson your professor is teaching (which I am guessing is String parsing).\r\n\r\nThat said, here are my clues to you:\r\n\r\n - Symbols (+ or -) can only be present at character index 0. \r\n - The (decimal) ASCII values for numbers 0-9 are 48-57. Therefore, an ASCII\r\n   value outside this range that is not a &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, or &quot;.&quot; (43, 45, or\r\n   46 respectively) is an illegal character.\r\n\r\nThe next thing you need to do is write down a few combinations of characters and test them out manually. For example:\r\n\r\n - 1.34 // invalid (first character must be the sign)\r\n - .123 // invalid (first character must be the sign)\r\n - -.98 // valid\r\n - -0.1 // valid\r\n - +2.3 // valid\r\n - 2.+6 // invalid\r\n - 4.3- // invalid\r\n - 30-4 // invalid\r\n - +23. // valid (by your requirements, but it should not be)\r\n - +0.- // invalid\r\n\r\nAll of the above contain nothing but valid characters, but not all are correctly formatted. Once you test these out, you should try using other non-numeric characters.\r\n\r\nYour code should be something like this (in psedocode)\r\n```\r\nIF STRING LENGTH &gt; 4, ERROR (String has too many characters)\r\nIF PERIOD COUNT &gt; 1, ERROR // See * note\r\nIF CHAR AT 0 NOT VALID, ERROR (Special case for symbols, period, or numbers)\r\nIF CHAR AT X NOT VALID, ERROR (index 1-3 can only be numbers or the period)\r\nIF CHAR AT 3 == ., ERROR (Last index cannot be the period)\r\nPRINT STING MESSAGE\r\n```\r\n(*) My suggestion is to use a loop operation to count the number of times the period appears on the String. There are other ways to do this, but my guess is that they are not related to your current lesson.

Although this question is technically correct, it is not correct for the lesson your professor is teaching (which I am guessing is String parsing).</p>\n<p>That said, here are my clues to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Symbols (+ or -) can only be present at character index 0.</li>\n<li>The (decimal) ASCII values for numbers 0-9 are 48-57. Therefore, an ASCII\nvalue outside this range that is not a &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, or &quot;.&quot; (43, 45, or\n46 respectively) is an illegal character.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The next thing you need to do is write down a few combinations of characters and test them out manually. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1.34 // invalid (first character must be the sign)</li>\n<li>.123 // invalid (first character must be the sign)</li>\n<li>-.98 // valid</li>\n<li>-0.1 // valid</li>\n<li>+2.3 // valid</li>\n<li>2.+6 // invalid</li>\n<li>4.3- // invalid</li>\n<li>30-4 // invalid</li>\n<li>+23. // valid (by your requirements, but it should not be)</li>\n<li>+0.- // invalid</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of the above contain nothing but valid characters, but not all are correctly formatted. Once you test these out, you should try using other non-numeric characters.</p>\n<p>Your code should be something like this (in psedocode)</p>\n<pre><code>IF STRING LENGTH &gt; 4, ERROR (String has too many characters)\nIF PERIOD COUNT &gt; 1, ERROR // See * note\nIF CHAR AT 0 NOT VALID, ERROR (Special case for symbols, period, or numbers)\nIF CHAR AT X NOT VALID, ERROR (index 1-3 can only be numbers or the period)\nIF CHAR AT 3 == ., ERROR (Last index cannot be the period)\nPRINT STING MESSAGE\n</code></pre>\n<p>(*) My suggestion is to use a loop operation to count the number of times the period appears on the String.

answer**: There&#39;s no way around single inheritance of classes in Java.

In general, inheritance - although a necessary evil at times - violate encapsulation and is more problematic that you might think. Without knowing much about your specific implementation details, on the surface, your problem seems to fit the case where composition over inheritance is the way to go.

From your post, you indicate you need to prompt the user for two distinct data items:\r\n\r\n 1. How many numbers will be entered (**count**)\r\n 2. The **values** to be analyzed\r\n\r\nIt is a good practice, especially when you are learning, to use meaningful names for your variables. You are using &#39;n&#39; for a variable name, then reusing it for different purposes during execution.  For you, it is obvious it was difficult to figure out what was &#39;n&#39; at a particular part of the program.\r\n```\r\nScanner input = new Scanner (System.in);\r\nint count;\r\nSystem.out.println (&quot;How many numbers will be entered?&quot;);\r\ncount = input.nextInt();\r\n\r\n//Wait for a valid input\r\nwhile (count &lt; 1 || count &gt; 100)\r\n{\r\n    System.out.println (&quot;ERROR! Valid range 1-100. RE-Enter:&quot;);\r\n    count = input.nextInt();        \r\n}\r\n```\r\nAdditionally, a count of zero should not be valid.  It does not make sense to run a program to evaluate zero values (don&#39;t bother a program that does nothing).  I believe the lowest count should be one instead.\r\n```\r\nint odd = 0;\r\nint even = 0;\r\nint value;\r\n\r\ndo\r\n{\r\n    System.out.print(&quot;Enter a number between 0 and 100: &quot;);\r\n    value = input.nextInt();\r\n    while (value &lt; 0 || value &gt; 100)\r\n    {\r\n        System.out.println (&quot;ERROR! Valid range 0-100. RE-Enter:&quot;);\r\n        value = input.nextInt();      \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (value % 2 == 0)\r\n    {\r\n        even++;\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n        odd++;\r\n    }\r\n\r\ncount--; // decrement count to escape loop\r\n} while (count &gt; 0);\r\nSystem.out.println(even + &quot; even. &quot; + odd + &quot; odd.&quot;);\r\n```\r\nThis example uses a do/while loop because in this case, it is OK to enter the loop at least once.  This is because you do not allow the user to enter an invalid number of iterations in the first part of the program.  I use that count variable directly for loop control (by decrementing its value down to 0), rather than creating another variable for loop control (for instance , &#39;i&#39;).\r\n\r\nAnother thing, slightly off topic, is that your requirements were not clear.  You only indicated that the value was bounded to (inclusive) values between 0 and 100.  However, how many times you needed to repeat the evaluation was not really clear.  Most people assume 100 was also the upper bound for your counter variable.  Because the requirement is not clear, checking a value greater or equal to 1 for the count might be valid, although highly improbable (you don&#39;t really want to repeat a million times).\r\n\r\nLastly, you have to pay attention to AND and OR logic in your code.  As it was indicated, your second while loop:\r\n```\r\nwhile (n &gt;= 0 || n &lt;= 100) {}\r\n```\r\nIs infinite. Because an OR evaluation only needs one part to evaluate to TRUE, any number entered will allow the loop to continue. Obviously, the intent was not allow values greater than 100.  However, entering 150 allows the loop to continue because 150 &gt;= 0.  Likewise, -90 also allows the loop to continue because -90 &lt;= 100.  This is when pseudocode helps when you are learning.  You wanted to express &quot;a VALUE between lower_limit AND upper_limit.&quot;  If you reverse the logic to evaluate values outside the limit, then you can say &quot; value below lower_limit OR above upper_limit.&quot;  These pseudocode expressions are very helpful determining which logical operator you need.\r\n\r\nI also took the liberty to add a message to prompt the user for a value. Your program expects the user to enter two numbers (count and value) but only one prompt message is provided; unless they enter an out of range value.","title":"java program outputting even/odd numbers","body":"<p>My suggestion to you is to have a clear separation of your requirements. From your post, you indicate you need to prompt the user for two distinct data items:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How many numbers will be entered (<strong>count</strong>)</li>\n<li>The <strong>values</strong> to be analyzed</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is a good practice, especially when you are learning, to use meaningful names for your variables. You are using 'n' for a variable name, then reusing it for different purposes during execution.  For you, it is obvious it was difficult to figure out what was 'n' at a particular part of the program.</p>\n<pre><code>Scanner input = new Scanner (System.in);\nint count;\nSystem.out.println (&quot;How many numbers will be entered?&quot;);\ncount = input.nextInt();\n\n//Wait for a valid input\nwhile (count &lt; 1 || count &gt; 100)\n{\n    System.out.println (&quot;ERROR! Valid range 1-100. RE-Enter:&quot;);\n    count = input.nextInt();        \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Additionally, a count of zero should not be valid.  It does not make sense to run a program to evaluate zero values (don't bother a program that does nothing).  I believe the lowest count should be one instead.</p>\n<pre><code>int odd = 0;\nint even = 0;\nint value;\n\ndo\n{\n    System.out.print(&quot;Enter a number between 0 and 100: &quot;);\n    value = input.nextInt();\n    while (value &lt; 0 || value &gt; 100)\n    {\n        System.out.println (&quot;ERROR! Valid range 0-100. RE-Enter:&quot;);\n        value = input.nextInt();      \n    }\n\n    if (value % 2 == 0)\n    {\n        even++;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        odd++;\n    }\n\ncount--; // decrement count to escape loop\n} while (count &gt; 0);\nSystem.out.println(even + &quot; even. &quot; + odd + &quot; odd.&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This example uses a do/while loop because in this case, it is OK to enter the loop at least once.  This is because you do not allow the user to enter an invalid number of iterations in the first part of the program.  I use that count variable directly for loop control (by decrementing its value down to 0), rather than creating another variable for loop control (for instance , 'i').</p>\n<p>Another thing, slightly off topic, is that your requirements were not clear.  You only indicated that the value was bounded to (inclusive) values between 0 and 100.  However, how many times you needed to repeat the evaluation was not really clear.  Most people assume 100 was also the upper bound for your counter variable.  Because the requirement is not clear, checking a value greater or equal to 1 for the count might be valid, although highly improbable (you don't really want to repeat a million times).</p>\n<p>Lastly, you have to pay attention to AND and OR logic in your code.  As it was indicated, your second while loop:</p>\n<pre><code>while (n &gt;= 0 || n &lt;= 100) {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is infinite. Because an OR evaluation only needs one part to evaluate to TRUE, any number entered will allow the loop to continue. Obviously, the intent was not allow values greater than 100.  However, entering 150 allows the loop to continue because 150 &gt;= 0.  Likewise, -90 also allows the loop to continue because -90 &lt;= 100.  This is when pseudocode helps when you are learning.  You wanted to express &quot;a VALUE between lower_limit AND upper_limit.&quot;  If you reverse the logic to evaluate values outside the limit, then you can say &quot; value below lower_limit OR above upper_limit.&quot;  These pseudocode expressions are very helpful determining which logical operator you need.</p>\n<p>I also took the liberty to add a message to prompt the user for a value.

But, if you were to change that to some object reference, you could run into all sorts of problems; one of which is that your code will not be thread-safe.\r\n```\r\npublic class MyDataProvider {\r\n  private Object nonStaticVariable;\r\n\r\n  public MyDataProvider () {\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public Object getNonStaticVariable() {\r\n    Object copy = new Object();\r\n    // copy the internals from nonStaticVariable to copy\r\n    return copy;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen, your utility class can use the copy of `nonStaticVariable` to do its work...\r\n```\r\npublic class MyUtilityClass {\r\n  public static void outputToTxt(Object nonStaticVariableCopy) {\r\n    // do your work\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis solution solves all those problems and is much more robust:\r\n\r\n 1. Allows a non-static variable to be used by a static method\r\n 2. Your code will be thread-safe because you are using a copy of the non-static variable instead of the original variable.\r\n 3. Separation of concerns: Your utility class doesn&#39;t store any variables; thus all methods of the utility class can be static (like Java&#39;s `Math` class), and your Data Provider can be the container that holds your variables.","title":"Using a non-static variable in a static method JAVA","body":"<p>My first thought is that perhaps either your non-static variable or your static method belong somewhere else.</p>\n<p>When a class hold variable, non-static contents, it's probably a bad idea to provide static accessor functions that use that variable.

The method MUST have a very specific signature `public static void main(String[] args)`. The reason why it needs this specific signature is because the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) needs to find it in order to execute your program. The JVM is that Java runtime &quot;thingy&quot; you install on your computer to run programs. More correctly, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) contains the JVM. The `String[] args` is 0 or more arguments the method accepts from the command prompt when executing a program. Simple programs often don&#39;t require any arguments being passed from the command prompt.\r\n\r\nWhat might confuse beginner Java programmers, is that it seems that many projects out there have main methods in every `.java` file. This is not required. This is done so that each class could be run in isolation from its dependencies. In a project (application) only one class is required to have a main method.\r\n\r\nOther methods\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nMethods other than the **main** method are optional. If you want, you could place 100% of your program logic inside of main. But, you can understand the problem with that. If you do that, your code will only be able to do a very specific sequence of steps. Back in the days prior to modular programming, this was the way it was done. So, if you needed to write a program that did something slightly different, you needed to write a new program. It is not very efficient, but it still works. Fast forward a few years after &quot;modular programming&quot; became a thing and now you have to write programs that have to react to events. For example, a user hovers the mouse over a button. The problem with events is that events are unpredictable. Not only you don&#39;t know WHEN events will occur, but also you cannot predict the ORDER in which they will occur. Therefore, having all the logic inside a single function (i.e. main) won&#39;t work and compiling a &quot;different&quot; sequence of steps inside main might not work also because you cannot predict the WHEN and HOW.\r\n\r\nMethods allow you to encapsulate very small units of execution in a prescribed order. The assumptions is that, whenever a situation calls for it, the same sequence of steps must be executed. So, you modularize your code and extract those small sequences you know will always execute in that order and put it in some &quot;method&quot; so that you could call that sequence of steps when I needed.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n-------\r\n\r\nSimple program with no command-line arguments\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class MyProgram {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n       System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen you execute the compiled unit from the command prompt, you will type `java MyProgram` and in the console you will see &quot;Hello World!&quot;\r\n```\r\npublic class MyProgram {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n       System.out.println(&quot;Hello &quot; + args[0]);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, in the above program, if you don&#39;t provide an argument, it will throw an exception when executing. But, if you pass at least one argument, it will display the very first argument and ignore the rest. For example, `java MyProgram Hector Fontanez` will display &quot;Hello Hector&quot;\r\n\r\nOn both examples, the JVM called the `main` method for execution.\r\n```\r\npublic class MyProgram {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n       showGreeting(&quot;Hello &quot; + args[0]);\r\n    }\r\n    public static void showGreeting(String greeting) {\r\n        System.out.println(greeting);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this last example, I created a function called `showGreeting`. Contrary to the `main` method, I as a programmer decided when and where to call this function, not the JVM. In the function, I extracted functionality I thought the method needs to execute in order to &quot;show a greeting&quot;. I know my example has only one line. But you get the idea.  As my program grows, I can call `showGreeting` from other parts of the program as many times I think, as a programmer, is necessary for my application to do the job it is required. Not only that, from the main method, the argument being passed will not necessarily the same as the argument that could be passed from another part of the program.\r\n\r\nLastly, you need to understand what are static and non-static methods, and also understand what `public`, `protected`, `private`, and default (no keyword) access modifiers do.","title":"Class method vs main methods","body":"<h2>The main method</h2>\n<p>This is the only method REQUIRED to run a Java application. The method MUST have a very specific signature <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>. The reason why it needs this specific signature is because the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) needs to find it in order to execute your program. The JVM is that Java runtime &quot;thingy&quot; you install on your computer to run programs. More correctly, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) contains the JVM. The <code>String[] args</code> is 0 or more arguments the method accepts from the command prompt when executing a program. Simple programs often don't require any arguments being passed from the command prompt.</p>\n<p>What might confuse beginner Java programmers, is that it seems that many projects out there have main methods in every <code>.java</code> file. This is not required. This is done so that each class could be run in isolation from its dependencies. In a project (application) only one class is required to have a main method.</p>\n<h2>Other methods</h2>\n<p>Methods other than the <strong>main</strong> method are optional. If you want, you could place 100% of your program logic inside of main. But, you can understand the problem with that. If you do that, your code will only be able to do a very specific sequence of steps. Back in the days prior to modular programming, this was the way it was done. So, if you needed to write a program that did something slightly different, you needed to write a new program. It is not very efficient, but it still works. Fast forward a few years after &quot;modular programming&quot; became a thing and now you have to write programs that have to react to events. For example, a user hovers the mouse over a button. The problem with events is that events are unpredictable. Not only you don't know WHEN events will occur, but also you cannot predict the ORDER in which they will occur. Therefore, having all the logic inside a single function (i.e. main) won't work and compiling a &quot;different&quot; sequence of steps inside main might not work also because you cannot predict the WHEN and HOW.</p>\n<p>Methods allow you to encapsulate very small units of execution in a prescribed order. The assumptions is that, whenever a situation calls for it, the same sequence of steps must be executed. So, you modularize your code and extract those small sequences you know will always execute in that order and put it in some &quot;method&quot; so that you could call that sequence of steps when I needed.</p>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p>Simple program with no command-line arguments</p>\n<pre><code>public class MyProgram {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n       System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When you execute the compiled unit from the command prompt, you will type <code>java MyProgram</code> and in the console you will see &quot;Hello World!&quot;</p>\n<pre><code>public class MyProgram {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n       System.out.println(&quot;Hello &quot; + args[0]);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, in the above program, if you don't provide an argument, it will throw an exception when executing. But, if you pass at least one argument, it will display the very first argument and ignore the rest. For example, <code>java MyProgram Hector Fontanez</code> will display &quot;Hello Hector&quot;</p>\n<p>On both examples, the JVM called the <code>main</code> method for execution.</p>\n<pre><code>public class MyProgram {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n       showGreeting(&quot;Hello &quot; + args[0]);\n    }\n    public static void showGreeting(String greeting) {\n        System.out.println(greeting);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this last example, I created a function called <code>showGreeting</code>. Contrary to the <code>main</code> method, I as a programmer decided when and where to call this function, not the JVM. In the function, I extracted functionality I thought the method needs to execute in order to &quot;show a greeting&quot;. I know my example has only one line. But you get the idea.  As my program grows, I can call <code>showGreeting</code> from other parts of the program as many times I think, as a programmer, is necessary for my application to do the job it is required. Not only that, from the main method, the argument being passed will not necessarily the same as the argument that could be passed from another part of the program.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you need to understand what are static and non-static methods, and also understand what <code>public</code>, <code>protected</code>, <code>private</code>, and default (no keyword) access modifiers do.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":430928,"reputation":101,"user_id":814646,"display_name":"Miranda"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":13184,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":7,"answer_count":6,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1640757651,"creation_date":1311281715,"question_id":6782670,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m rather confused by the concept of making a class with methods, and having a main method with methods underneath. \r\n\r\nWhat exactly are the differences here?

The annotation `@Override` helps a developer to know that the method is being overridden. If you get a compilation error when using this annotation, it means that the method being overridden doesn&#39;t exist in the super (parent) class. To fix this problem, a developer must do one of two things: 1) Remove the annotation, indicating that the method is a brand new method in the subclass, or 2) Create a method with the exact declaration in the parent class.\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Method Overloading&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class MyClass {\r\n    ...\r\n    public void method1() {...}\r\n    public String method1() {...} // different return type\r\n    public void method1(String s1) {...} // different parameter list\r\n    public void method1(String s1, int x) {...} // different parameter list than previous\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHere, the method is said to be overloaded because it has more than one function (4 functions with the same name). This is similar to the use of the `+` in Java. When use with numbers, the symbol means addition. When it&#39;s used with `String` objects, it means concatenation.\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;What does this mean to you?&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nWhen defining method overriding, I wrote &quot;defines the method from an interface.&quot; In your case, you created an interface with three methods (interface methods are inherently `public` - no need to declare them as such):\r\n\r\n 1. `int getAccountNum()`\r\n 2. `void deposit()`\r\n 3. `int getBalance()`\r\n\r\nThis means that classes implementing an interface **MUST** implement ALL of these methods. Now, you did not understand the error: `BankAccount is not abstract and does not override abstract method deposit()`. What that means is that your class `BankAccount` is not an abstract class and therefore, is required to implement the methods included in the interface. Abstract classes are exempt from this rule because you cannot create instances of an abstract class. So, classes extending an abstract class that implement an interface MUST conform to the methods included in said interface. For example:\r\n```\r\npublic interface MyInterface {\r\n    void method1();\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic abstract class MyParent implements MyInterface {\r\n    // This is a valid abstract class even though it extends an interface\r\n    // Implementing the interface methods is delegated down to the children classes\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class MyChild extends MyParent {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void method1 () {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNotice that both the interface and the concrete class contain a method `void method1()`. Lastly, notice that the method in the interface does not have an access modifier, but the implementing class declares it as `public`. This is a property of interfaces. All (abstract) methods of an interface are public by nature.\r\n\r\nLastly, I want to emphasize the importance of using annotations like `@Override`. For starters, if you don&#39;t override the method correctly, you will know immediately. And, as a side benefit, it is a great way to communicate intent.","title":"class is not abstract and does not override abstract method simple code","body":"<p>There are two concepts that you need to learn:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Method overriding</em> - When a subclass changes the inner-workings of the exact method declared in a parent class, or defines the method from an interface</li>\n<li><em>Method overloading</em> - When a method with the same name appears in a class with different parameter list and or return type</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let explore the two:</p>\n<h3>Method Overriding</h3>\n<pre><code>public class Parent {\n    ...\n    public void method1() {\n        // DO SOMETHING\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<pre><code>public class Child extends Parent {\n    ...\n    @Override\n    public void method1() {\n        // DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice the the entire method declaration in both classes is the same <code>public void method1()</code>.

Then, instead of using index locations (and potentially grab the wrong data item), you could use the Record getter methods to get the data item you need (and perhaps store it in a different list). \r\n\r\n**Step 1**: Create a `Record` class:\r\n```    \r\npublic class Record\r\n{\r\n    private String firstName;\r\n    private String lastName;\r\n    private String job;\r\n    private String id;\r\n\r\n    // TODO add constructor(s), getters and setters\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Step 2**: Create a list of `Records` (this is an better alternative that create a list having the information in different index locations.

For example, a job ID could be the key in a Map that returns a job description and who has been assigned to perform it.  Job IDs have to be unique. Adding IDs to a list can be duplicated, because the `List` interface doesn&#39;t restrict entering duplicate data.  If you use a Map, they keys are guaranteed to be unique.

I is initialised and also visible to the program.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","eclipse","debugging","vpn"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":22194,"reputation":18092,"user_id":54506,"accept_rate":78,"display_name":"Jayan"},"score":0,"creation_date":1426579401,"post_id":28433411,"comment_id":46419256,"body_markdown":"Java debugger may be very chatty ; that is affected by VPN.","body":"Java debugger may be very chatty ; that is affected by VPN."},{"owner":{"account_id":22194,"reputation":18092,"user_id":54506,"accept_rate":78,"display_name":"Jayan"},"score":1,"creation_date":1426579534,"post_id":28433411,"comment_id":46419306,"body_markdown":"You may setup machine in office with IDE and connect to that over VPN.

we have an Activity with a lot of views on which `OnClickListener` is to be registered.\r\n\r\nThe most common way to implement this is to let the Activity-Subclass implement the OnClickListener, something like this:\r\n\r\n    public class ActivityMain extends Activity implements View.OnClickListener\r\n    {   \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onClick(View view)\r\n        {\r\n

private class inside the Activity-Subclass and let that inner class implement the OnClickListener:\r\n\r\n    public class ActivityMain extends Activity implements View.OnClickListener\r\n    {\r\n        private class ClickListener implements View.OnClickListener\r\n        {   \r\n            @Override\r\n            public void onClick(View view)\r\n            {\r\n                switch

and easy to maintain.\r\n\r\nMoreover, talking about &quot;Is-a&quot;, &quot;Has-a&quot; relationships, the latter seems to be a good practice because now the Activity-Subclass would have a &quot;Has-a&quot; relationship with the ClickListener.\r\nWhile in the former method we would be saying that Our Activity-Subclass &quot;Is-a&quot; ClickListener, which ain&#39;t completely true.\r\n\r\nNote that, I am not concerned with the memory overhead the latter would cause.\r\n\r\nAlso, adding onClick tag in xml is completely out of question.\r\n\r\nSo, what really is the best way to implement a ClickListener?\r\n\r\nPlease don&#39;t suggest any libraries like RoboGuice or ButterKnife etc.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:**\r\n\r\nI would like to share the approach I finally adopted.\r\n\r\nI directly implement the listener in Activity/Fragment.\r\n\r\nAs far as OOP design is concerned. The **&quot;HAS-A&quot;** approach doesn&#39;t offers any practical benefits and even takes up more memory.
