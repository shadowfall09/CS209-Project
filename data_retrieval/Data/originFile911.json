Creates a JavaFX [`Label`][2] and a [`WebView`][3].\r\n 2. Loads an HTML document.\r\n 3. Associates a [`JSObject`][4] with the JavaFX app.\r\n 4. The JavaFX app exposes a method that provides the label.\r\n 5. JavaScript is invoked which gets the app provided by the JSObject.\r\n 6. JavaScript gets the label from the app and the text from the label.\r\n 7. JavaScript sets the copied label text into an element in the HTML document which is displayed by the WebView.\r\n\r\nSome things to note:\r\n\r\n 1. Use [current documentation on `WebEngine`][5] (for JavaFX 19), don&#39;t use outdated documentation from JavaFX 2.  \r\n\r\n    * The outdated documentation does not explain how to use the `WebEngine` within a modular environment.  The additional information on modularity will be critical for some applications.\r\n\r\n 2. To access the `WebView`, use:\r\n\r\n        requires javafx.web;\r\n\r\n 3. To access the `JSObject` which bridges Java and the WebView, use:\r\n\r\n        requires jdk.jsobject;\r\n\r\n 4. To have your code accessible to JavaScript executing in `WebView`, use:\r\n        \r\n        opens &lt;package-with-your-code&gt; to javafx.web\r\n\r\n    This is required because, internally, the `WebEngine` will use reflection on your code to allow JavaScript to call it. \r\n\r\n 5. Make sure the document is loaded before performing actions on it.\r\n\r\nYou don&#39;t (as far as I can tell) need to provide transitive access to the objects you return to the webview.  For instance, in the JavaScript I call, `app.getLabel().getText();`, but just opening the package with my app to `javafx.web` is sufficient, I don&#39;t need to open the `javafx.scene.control` package to `javafx.web`.

I also have initialized to 0, and thats when I get the exception here.</p>\n<p>The Error:</p>\n<pre><code>Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.util.NoSuchElementException\n        at java.base/java.util.Scanner.throwFor(Scanner.java:937)\n        at java.base/java.util.Scanner.next(Scanner.java:1594)\n        at java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextInt(Scanner.java:2258)\n        at java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextInt(Scanner.java:2212)\n        at Battleship.battleship.shipLocations(battleship.java:31)\n        at Battleship.battleship.main(battleship.java:14)\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>    public static void main(String[] args){\n        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); //read keyboard input\n        //Begin the game\n        System.out.println(&quot;Hello Mortals, Welcome to Battleship!&quot;);\n        \n        System.out.println(&quot;PLAYER 1, Enter your ships' coordinates.&quot;);\n        //Take in player ones coordinates\n        int[] coordinate1 = shipLocations(1);\n//heres where the problem starts\n        int[] coordinate2 = shipLocations(2);\n        // int[] coordinate3 = shipLocations(3);\n        // int[] coordinate4 = shipLocations(4);\n        // int[] coordinate5 = shipLocations(5);\n\n    \n    input.close();\n    }\n    public static int[] shipLocations(int shipNumber){\n        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);\n        //I can either initialize over my input threshold check, to make sure only valid coordinates are available, or if I set to 0 it throws the exception error on the second method call. \n        int coordinate1=6;\n        int coordinate2=6;\n        System.out.println(&quot;Enter Ship &quot; + shipNumber + &quot; location: &quot;);\n        \n        if(input.hasNextInt()){\n            coordinate1 =input.nextInt();\n            coordinate2= input.nextInt();\n        }\n        int[] coordinates = new int[2];\n        if(coordinate1 &gt; 4 || coordinate2 &gt; 4){\n            Boolean invalidCoords = true;\n            do{\n                System.out.println(&quot;Invalid Coordinates.

For example `(2 * 8) / (8 - 6) == 8` but `((2 * 8) / 8) - 6 == -4`. To disambiguate, Java uses a list of precedence rules that are common throughout most languages. You can find the complete list [here][1].\r\n\r\nFor your case the important part is that multiplication and division are applied before addition and subtraction. \r\n\r\nAlso of note is what happens in the case of operators having equal precedence, which also appears in your example.\r\n\r\n&gt; When operators of equal precedence appear in the same expression, a rule must govern which is evaluated first.

If I write something like <code>2 * 8 / 8 - 6</code>, without further context, it is ambiguous how it should be evaluated. This can lead to different results.

We also have a reference for the data so we&#39;ve got a process that compares the synthesized data against the reference, finding where it hits or misses, the misses being displayed prominently for user action.\r\n\r\nTo that end, I&#39;ve created a JavaFX GUI in the &quot;click on summary to display detail data&quot; style where the synthesized data is selected from a `TableView` and the comparison and reference data are fetched from DB and displayed in auxiliary `TableView`s.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m also using some `CheckComboBox`  from ControlsFX as filters to manipulate what&#39;s visible in the synthesized data `TableView`.\r\n\r\nSo I have the typical `ObservableList&lt;Data&gt;` (the data itself) -&gt; `FilteredList&lt;Data&gt;` (the list filtered by predicate-driven `CheckComboBox`es) -&gt; `SortedList&lt;Data&gt;` (the list put into the `TableView`). So, to make it all work, I have to put a `ListChangeListener` on the `TableView.getSelectionModel().getSelectedItems()` `ObservableList`.\r\n\r\nSo, to the point: On the occasion that (a) a filter is in selected state and (b) something is selected in the `TableView` and (c) the filter is changed, the predicate actions and the selectedItems listener kinda go nuts with some kind of mutually recursive back and forth until, at the end, the selectedItems listener thinks that all of the items in the list are selected whereas visually, only one or no things are actually selected. (This also leads to a flurry of DB requests because of all the back and forth changes, which is really the main annoyance.)\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s some code that illustrates the problem:\r\n```\r\npackage com.example.javafx;\r\n\r\nimport javafx.beans.property.*;\r\n\r\npublic class Person implements Comparable&lt;Person&gt;

We also have a reference for the data so we've got a process that compares the synthesized data against the reference, finding where it hits or misses, the misses being displayed prominently for user action.</p>\n<p>To that end, I've created a JavaFX GUI in the &quot;click on summary to display detail data&quot; style where the synthesized data is selected from a <code>TableView</code> and the comparison and reference data are fetched from DB and displayed in auxiliary <code>TableView</code>s.</p>\n<p>I'm also using some <code>CheckComboBox</code>  from ControlsFX as filters to manipulate what's visible in the synthesized data <code>TableView</code>.</p>\n<p>So I have the typical <code>ObservableList&lt;Data&gt;</code> (the data itself) -&gt; <code>FilteredList&lt;Data&gt;</code> (the list filtered by predicate-driven <code>CheckComboBox</code>es) -&gt; <code>SortedList&lt;Data&gt;</code> (the list put into the <code>TableView</code>). So, to make it all work, I have to put a <code>ListChangeListener</code> on the <code>TableView.getSelectionModel().getSelectedItems()</code> <code>ObservableList</code>.</p>\n<p>So, to the point: On the occasion that (a) a filter is in selected state and (b) something is selected in the <code>TableView</code> and (c) the filter is changed, the predicate actions and the selectedItems listener kinda go nuts with some kind of mutually recursive back and forth until, at the end, the selectedItems listener thinks that all of the items in the list are selected whereas visually, only one or no things are actually selected.

And I suggest replacing the var name `pool` with `ExecutorService`, as an executor service is not necessarily backed with a thread pool, nor should we really be thinking of an executor service as being merely a thread pool.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n void shutdownAndAwaitTermination(ExecutorService pool) {\r\n   pool.shutdown(); // Disable new tasks from being submitted\r\n   try {\r\n     // Wait a while for existing tasks to terminate\r\n     if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {\r\n       pool.shutdownNow(); // Cancel currently executing tasks\r\n       // Wait a while for tasks to respond to being cancelled\r\n       if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS))\r\n           System.err.println(&quot;Pool did not terminate&quot;);\r\n     }\r\n   } catch (InterruptedException ex) {\r\n     // (Re-)Cancel if current thread also interrupted\r\n     pool.shutdownNow();\r\n     // Preserve interrupt status\r\n     Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\r\n   }\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince you want to gather results only after all the tasks complete, you should not be accessing the `Future` objects until *after* this `shutdownAndAwaitTermination` method returns. See the example code in Javadoc for [`Future`][4] interface. \r\n\r\nFor example, if your tasks return a `String` object:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfor ( Future &lt; String &gt; future : futures )\r\n{\r\n     try {\r\n       String result = future.get() ;  // Use `Future` object to access its payload, the result of the task’s execution.\r\n       System.out.println( result ) ;  \r\n     } catch ( ExecutionException e ) { … }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou said:\r\n\r\n&gt; I do shutdown the executor service and awaitTermination for 30 seconds, which time will take effect? Is it 30 seconds? Since it&#39;s shorter than 5 minutes?\r\n\r\nReading the Javadoc would answer your questions. To quote:\r\n\r\n - [`ExecutorService#shutdown`][6]&lt;br /&gt;Initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously submitted tasks are executed, but no new tasks will be accepted. \r\n - `ExecutorService#awaitTermination`&lt;br /&gt;Blocks until all tasks have completed execution after a shutdown request, or the timeout occurs, or the current thread is interrupted, whichever happens first.\r\n\r\n# `Future#get` blocks\r\n\r\nYou asked:\r\n\r\n&gt; if I place a 5 minutes timeout in the get() method\r\n\r\nApparently you meant [`Future#get`][7]. The Javadoc says:\r\n\r\n&gt;Waits if necessary for at most the given time for the computation to complete, and then retrieves its result, if available.\r\n\r\n“Waits” means this line blocks until either result is available or the time-out expires. So whatever code you have below this line is irrelevant. \r\n\r\nIf you have two calls to `Future#get`, each with a 5-minute timeout, the first call waits up to five minutes, then the second call waits up to five minutes. So the maximum time total is about 10 minutes, while the minimum time is the time taken to immediately return each `Future` object’s payload. \r\n\r\n    String result1 = myFuture1.get( 5 , TimeUnit.MINUTES ) ;  // Blocks up to five minutes. Code below is irrelevant. \r\n    String result2 = myFuture2.get( 5 , TimeUnit.MINUTES ) ;  // Blocks up to five minutes. Code below is irrelevant. \r\n    // At this point, up to 10 minutes may have elapsed maximum (appropriately). \r\n\r\nI say &quot;approximately&quot; because timing is never exact in conventional Java (as opposed to [real time Java][8]). Java’s internal scheduling of tasks, and the host OS’ CPU scheduling of the JVM and its threads, means actual elapsed time may vary.\r\n\r\n\r\n# *Project Loom*\r\n\r\n[Project Loom][9] is work being done on the [*OpenJDK*][10] project. Its aim is to bring new capabilities to Java’s threading and concurrency facilities.\r\n\r\nAmong the new features are [virtual threads][11] and [structured concurrency][12]. These are previewed and incubated (respectively) in Java 19. \r\n\r\nThese features may generally eliminate the need for [`CompletableFuture`][13] which you mentioned but did not discuss. And these may provide a more convenient way to define a set of tasks to be completed together. \r\n\r\nFor more info, see:\r\n \r\n - The JEPs linked above.\r\n - The latest talks and interviews by members of the team such as Ron Pressler and Alan Bateman. \r\n - The talks by Jos&#233; Paumard, [Java Champion][14], host of the [*JEP Caf&#233;*][15] channel on YouTube.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nThese topics have been addressed many times already on Stack Overflow.

Even a little advice, I will be really appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thank You.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","junit","junit5"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3004304,"reputation":6348,"user_id":2549110,"accept_rate":25,"display_name":"Gauravsa"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1539934354,"creation_date":1539934354,"answer_id":52887702,"question_id":52887572,"body_markdown":"You can implement a Singleton pattern:\r\n\r\n    public class TestIntegration{\r\n    public final static Server testServer = new Server();\r\n       \r\n    private TestIntegration() {\r\n        }     \r\n    }\r\nThen call      \r\n\r\n    TestIntegration.testServer.Start();","title":"one instance per junit instead of each new instance per test case","body":"<p>You can implement a Singleton pattern:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class TestIntegration{\npublic final static Server testServer = new Server();\n\nprivate TestIntegration() {\n    }     \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then call      </p>\n\n<pre><code>TestIntegration.testServer.Start();\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":7304036,"reputation":223,"user_id":5565602,"display_name":"tempEngineer"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1539938722,"creation_date":1539938722,"answer_id":52888830,"question_id":52887572,"body_markdown":"By default, one instance of testing class per test is the way JUnit works.\r\n\r\nBut you can achieve what you are trying to do using @BeforeClass annotation and static.\r\n\r\n    public class TestIntegration{\r\n\r\n      public static TestIntegration testServer;\r\n\r\n      @BeforeClass\r\n      public static void  TestIntegration(){\r\n        testServer = new TestIntegration();\r\n        testServer.start();\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      @Test\r\n      public void test1(){\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Test 1&quot;);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      @Test\r\n      public void test2(){\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Test 2&quot;);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    }","title":"one instance per junit instead of each new instance per test case","body":"<p>By default, one instance of testing class per test is the way JUnit works.</p>\n\n<p>But you can achieve what you are trying to do using @BeforeClass annotation and static.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class TestIntegration{\n\n  public static TestIntegration testServer;\n\n  @BeforeClass\n  public static void  TestIntegration(){\n    testServer = new TestIntegration();\n    testServer.start();\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void test1(){\n    System.out.println(\"Test 1\");\n  }\n\n  @Test\n  public void test2(){\n    System.out.println(\"Test 2\");\n  }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":14554870,"reputation":72,"user_id":10512697,"display_name":"Sarah"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1539950238,"creation_date":1539950238,"answer_id":52891883,"question_id":52887572,"body_markdown":"If you want to work with non-static objects, use the Annotation @Before:\r\n\r\n    @Before\r\n    public void before() {\r\n        testServer = new TestServer();\r\n        testServer.start();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis will start your server before running the tests.\r\n\r\nCheck out further information: http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/Before.html\r\n","title":"one instance per junit instead of each new instance per test case","body":"<p>If you want to work with non-static objects, use the Annotation @Before:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Before\npublic void before() {\n    testServer = new TestServer();\n    testServer.start();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will start your server before running the tests.</p>\n\n<p>Check out further information: <a href=\"http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/Before.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/Before.html</a></p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":13034651,"reputation":235,"user_id":9419988,"display_name":"willy"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1539956150,"creation_date":1539956150,"answer_id":52893474,"question_id":52887572,"body_markdown":"Thanks\r\n\r\nSeems we can use test instance per class in junit 5.
