I suspect it&#39;ll be the same thing for you.\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\n\r\nThe problem is related to **service loading**, a Java feature I previously knew nothing about.  In order to remain &quot;pluggable&quot;, neo4j loads a lot of its services dynamically, by declaring an interface that describes a &quot;service&quot; and implementing it with several &quot;service providers&quot; that are identified at runtime.  This is a [fairly common pattern](https://pedrorijo.com/blog/java-service-loader/) in Java projects.\r\n\r\nOne example is the interface `org.neo4j.configuration.SettingsDeclaration`, which has implementations in various packages in the neo4j project, including `org.neo4j.configuration.GraphDatabaseSettings`, which is needed in order for any graph databases to be configured.  When run from a local build (in your case, your IDE) these are all found in the classpath and everything works fine.  But when run from an executable jar, we need to declare them all explicitly in a file called `META-INF/services/org.neo4j.configuration.SettingsDeclaration`, on one line each.\r\n\r\nThe problem arises because `maven-assembly-plugin` copies these `services/` files fairly dumbly, and the declared services from one package can overwrite those from another.  For me this meant that only one implementation of `SettingsDeclaration` was being loaded, where there should have been 15.  This causes things to fail in mysterious ways, with unhelpful error messages appearing when you actually try to create a database.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nIf two `services/*` files exist with the same name, in different imported packages, we need to *merge* them instead of overwriting.  Fortunately, `maven-assembly-plugin` has a feature just for this: the `metaInf-services` handler.

I suspect it'll be the same thing for you.</p>\n<h1>Problem</h1>\n<p>The problem is related to <strong>service loading</strong>, a Java feature I previously knew nothing about.  In order to remain &quot;pluggable&quot;, neo4j loads a lot of its services dynamically, by declaring an interface that describes a &quot;service&quot; and implementing it with several &quot;service providers&quot; that are identified at runtime.  This is a <a href=\"https://pedrorijo.com/blog/java-service-loader/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">fairly common pattern</a> in Java projects.</p>\n<p>One example is the interface <code>org.neo4j.configuration.SettingsDeclaration</code>, which has implementations in various packages in the neo4j project, including <code>org.neo4j.configuration.GraphDatabaseSettings</code>, which is needed in order for any graph databases to be configured.  When run from a local build (in your case, your IDE) these are all found in the classpath and everything works fine.  But when run from an executable jar, we need to declare them all explicitly in a file called <code>META-INF/services/org.neo4j.configuration.SettingsDeclaration</code>, on one line each.</p>\n<p>The problem arises because <code>maven-assembly-plugin</code> copies these <code>services/</code> files fairly dumbly, and the declared services from one package can overwrite those from another.  For me this meant that only one implementation of <code>SettingsDeclaration</code> was being loaded, where there should have been 15.  This causes things to fail in mysterious ways, with unhelpful error messages appearing when you actually try to create a database.</p>\n<h1>Solution</h1>\n<p>If two <code>services/*</code> files exist with the same name, in different imported packages, we need to <em>merge</em> them instead of overwriting.  Fortunately, <code>maven-assembly-plugin</code> has a feature just for this: the <code>metaInf-services</code> handler.  We need to configure the plugin to use this handler.</p>\n<p>Your <code>pom.xml</code> contains the following element in the configuration of the plugin:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>        &lt;descriptorRefs&gt;\n            &lt;descriptorRef&gt;jar-with-dependencies&lt;/descriptorRef&gt;\n        &lt;/descriptorRefs&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is telling the plugin to use the pre-defined <code>jar-with-dependencies</code> descriptor, which does most of what we want.

Is this correct?\r\n\r\nMore accurately, you can say that `C` and `D` are in the set of *permitted direct subclasses* of `I1`, which is a term defined in section 9.1.4. The JLS doesn&#39;t really define what &quot;`I1` *permits* `C` and `D`&quot; means though.\r\n\r\nAs for your switch expression, the reason why it works is two-fold. First, you are able to write a type pattern in a switch label if the type of the switch selector expression is downcast-convertible to that type.\r\n\r\n[14.11.1][1]\r\n\r\n&gt; A pattern case element p is switch compatible with T if p is applicable at type T ([14.30.3][2]).\r\n\r\n14.30.3:\r\n\r\n&gt; A pattern p is said to be applicable at a type T if one of the following rules apply:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; - A type pattern that declares a pattern variable of a reference type U is applicable at another reference type T if T is downcast convertible to U ([5.5][3]).\r\n&gt; \r\n\r\nObviously, `E` is downcast-convertible to `I1` through a widening reference conversion, because `E` implements `I1`. Note that this fact has nothing to do with `permits`. It is simply a result of `E implements I2` and `I2 extends I1`. Surely you would agree that `implements` and `extends` are transitive!\r\n\r\nSecond, switch expressions need to be exhaustive. Your switch expression is always exhaustive because it has a `default` case. However, it is still exhaustive even without the `default` case.\r\n\r\nFrom now on, we will consider your switch expression but without the `default` case, because that is where `permits` plays a role. The rules to determine whether the set of case labels you wrote are exhaustive are specified in [14.11.1.1][4]. The important bit of your case is (this is kind of an inductive definition):\r\n\r\n&gt; - A set of case elements is exhaustive for a type T if it contains a pattern that is unconditional at type T (14.30.3).\r\n&gt; - A set of case elements is exhaustive for a type T that includes an abstract and sealed class or interface named C, if it is exhaustive\r\n&gt; for every applicable permitted direct subtype of T.\r\n\r\n&quot;applicable permitted direct subtype of T&quot; in your case is really just the same as &quot;permitted direct subtype of T&quot;. You can also treat &quot;a type T that includes an abstract and sealed class or interface named C&quot; as the same as `T` - the &quot;includes&quot; relationship isn&#39;t relevant to your case. With `T=I1` in mind, we can start &quot;running&quot; this algorithm.\r\n\r\nWe use the second rule first - the permitted direct subtypes of `I1` are `I2`, `C` and `D`. Since we have a `C c` and `D d` in the case elements, we know that our set of case elements is exhaustive for `C` and `D` (first rule). Is it also exhaustive for `I2`? To determine that, we use the second rule again. The permitted direct subtypes of `I2` are `E` and `F`. Using the first rule, we know that the case elements `E e` and `F f` are exhaustive for `E` and `F` respectively. We have now proven that that the set of case elements are exhaustive for `I2`, `C` and `D`, so it is exhaustive for `I1`, according to the second rule.\r\n\r\nSo if you are talking about how switch patterns work, I think &quot;inductive&quot; is a better word to describe how the exhaustiveness of switch case labels are verified.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se19/preview/specs/patterns-switch-record-patterns-jls.html#jls-14.11.1\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se19/preview/specs/patterns-switch-record-patterns-jls.html#jls-14.30.3\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se19/preview/specs/patterns-switch-record-patterns-jls.html#jls-5.5\r\n  [4]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se19/preview/specs/patterns-switch-record-patterns-jls.html#jls-14.11.1.1","title":"Is the permits relationship of Java Sealed classes/interfaces transitive","body":"<blockquote>\n<p><code>I1</code> obviously permits <code>C</code> and <code>D</code> but not <code>E</code> and <code>F</code>.

Your switch expression is always exhaustive because it has a <code>default</code> case. However, it is still exhaustive even without the <code>default</code> case.</p>\n<p>From now on, we will consider your switch expression but without the <code>default</code> case, because that is where <code>permits</code> plays a role. The rules to determine whether the set of case labels you wrote are exhaustive are specified in <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se19/preview/specs/patterns-switch-record-patterns-jls.html#jls-14.11.1.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">14.11.1.1</a>. The important bit of your case is (this is kind of an inductive definition):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>A set of case elements is exhaustive for a type T if it contains a pattern that is unconditional at type T (14.30.3).</li>\n<li>A set of case elements is exhaustive for a type T that includes an abstract and sealed class or interface named C, if it is exhaustive\nfor every applicable permitted direct subtype of T.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&quot;applicable permitted direct subtype of T&quot; in your case is really just the same as &quot;permitted direct subtype of T&quot;. You can also treat &quot;a type T that includes an abstract and sealed class or interface named C&quot; as the same as <code>T</code> - the &quot;includes&quot; relationship isn't relevant to your case. With <code>T=I1</code> in mind, we can start &quot;running&quot; this algorithm.</p>\n<p>We use the second rule first - the permitted direct subtypes of <code>I1</code> are <code>I2</code>, <code>C</code> and <code>D</code>. Since we have a <code>C c</code> and <code>D d</code> in the case elements, we know that our set of case elements is exhaustive for <code>C</code> and <code>D</code> (first rule). Is it also exhaustive for <code>I2</code>? To determine that, we use the second rule again. The permitted direct subtypes of <code>I2</code> are <code>E</code> and <code>F</code>. Using the first rule, we know that the case elements <code>E e</code> and <code>F f</code> are exhaustive for <code>E</code> and <code>F</code> respectively. We have now proven that that the set of case elements are exhaustive for <code>I2</code>, <code>C</code> and <code>D</code>, so it is exhaustive for <code>I1</code>, according to the second rule.</p>\n<p>So if you are talking about how switch patterns work, I think &quot;inductive&quot; is a better word to describe how the exhaustiveness of switch case labels are verified.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":4910286,"reputation":458,"user_id":3955765,"display_name":"twwwt"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":948,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"accepted_answer_id":74339207,"answer_count":2,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1667832651,"creation_date":1667752089,"question_id":74337681,"body_markdown":"If I read the JLS [&#167;8.1.6][1] and [&#167;9.1.4][2] correctly, the classes that a sealed class/interface permits, are just the *direct* subclasses/interfaces.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this, consider the following example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic sealed interface I1 permits I2, C, D { /*...*/ }\r\npublic final class C implements I1 { /*...*/ }\r\npublic final class D implements I1 { /*...*/ }\r\n\r\npublic sealed interface I2 extends I1 permits E, F { /*...*/ }\r\npublic final class E implements I2 { /*...*/ }\r\npublic final class F implements I2 { /*...*/ }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I understand the specification correctly, `I1` obviously permits `C` and `D` but not `E` and `F` (via the `extends` hierarchy of `I2` from `I1`).

Then consider whether this is reasonable (you can see how many file descriptors are open while the server is running with the <code>lsof</code> command, ideally with the -p [process ID] parameter.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":8688,"reputation":2118,"user_id":15768,"display_name":"alasdairg"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1257173207,"creation_date":1257173207,"answer_id":1661714,"question_id":1661322,"body_markdown":"Its worth bearing in mind that **open sockets** also consume file handles on Unix systems.

Let&#39;s say we have a list with three nodes with 1, 2, and 3 as values, then at the start of the loop we have this state:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nprevious: null\r\nnext: null\r\n\r\n         current\r\n           ↓\r\n      ┌────────────┐   ┌────────────┐   ┌────────────────┐\r\n      │ data: 1    │   │ data: 2    │   │ data: 3        │\r\n      │ nextNode: ───► │ nextNode: ───► │ nextNode: null │\r\n      └────────────┘   └────────────┘   └────────────────┘\r\n             ▲\r\n ┌───────────│─┐\r\n │ headNode: ┘ │\r\n └─────────────┘\r\n        ↑\r\n       list\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the first assignment in the loop body, we can understand that `previous` points to the node *before* `current` (if any) and `next` to the node *after* `current` (if any). Although not really accurate, it helps to visualise `null` as if it is a virtual node. So we may picture that as follows:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nprevious  current            next\r\n   ↓         ↓                ↓\r\n        ┌────────────┐   ┌────────────┐   ┌────────────┐\r\n        │ data: 1    │   │ data: 2    │   │ data: 3    │\r\n null   │ nextNode: ───► │ nextNode: ───► │ nextNode: ───► null\r\n        └────────────┘   └────────────┘   └────────────┘\r\n             ▲\r\n ┌───────────│─┐\r\n │ headNode: ┘ │\r\n └─────────────┘\r\n        ↑\r\n       list\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvery time we arrive at the second statement in the loop&#39;s body, we&#39;ll have this invariant: `previous` - `current` - `next` reference successive nodes or are null.\r\n\r\nNow a rewiring takes place with `current.nextNode = previous`. The current node&#39;s `nextNode` reference will no longer point to `next` but to `previous`:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nprevious  current            next\r\n   ↓         ↓                ↓\r\n        ┌────────────┐   ┌────────────┐   ┌────────────┐\r\n        │ data: 1    │   │ data: 2    │   │ data: 3    │\r\n null ◄─── :nextNode │   │ nextNode: ───► │ nextNode: ───► null\r\n        └────────────┘   └────────────┘   └────────────┘\r\n             ▲\r\n ┌───────────│─┐\r\n │ headNode: ┘ │\r\n └─────────────┘\r\n        ↑\r\n       list\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last two statements of the loop body, and the first one in the next iteration, together shift the 3 node references to the right:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n          previous         current            next\r\n             ↓                ↓                ↓\r\n        ┌────────────┐   ┌────────────┐   ┌────────────┐\r\n        │ data: 1    │   │ data: 2    │   │ data: 3    │\r\n null ◄─── :nextNode │   │ nextNode: ───► │ nextNode: ───► null\r\n        └────────────┘   └────────────┘   └────────────┘\r\n             ▲\r\n ┌───────────│─┐\r\n │ headNode: ┘ │\r\n └─────────────┘\r\n        ↑\r\n       list\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd again the `nextNode` member of `current` is redirected with `current.nextNode = previous`:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n          previous         current            next\r\n             ↓                ↓                ↓\r\n        ┌────────────┐   ┌────────────┐   ┌────────────┐\r\n        │ data: 1    │   │ data: 2    │   │ data: 3    │\r\n null ◄─── :nextNode │ ◄─── :nextNode │   │ nextNode: ───► null\r\n        └────────────┘   └────────────┘   └────────────┘\r\n             ▲\r\n ┌───────────│─┐\r\n │ headNode: ┘ │\r\n └─────────────┘\r\n        ↑\r\n       list\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother invariant to highlight: *after* that rewiring assignment, `current` is the head of a *reversed* list, while `next` is the head of the unaltered part of the list.\r\n\r\nAgain we iterate further, and perform the shift:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n                           previous         current        next\r\n                              ↓                ↓            ↓\r\n        ┌────────────┐   ┌────────────┐   ┌────────────┐\r\n        │ data: 1    │   │ data: 2    │   │ data: 3    │\r\n null ◄─── :nextNode │ ◄─── :nextNode │   │ nextNode: ───► null\r\n        └────────────┘   └────────────┘   └────────────┘\r\n             ▲\r\n ┌───────────│─┐\r\n │ headNode: ┘ │\r\n └─────────────┘\r\n        ↑\r\n       list\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd again, `current.nextNode` is mutated to point &quot;backwards&quot;:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n                           previous         current        next\r\n                              ↓                ↓            ↓\r\n        ┌────────────┐   ┌────────────┐   ┌────────────┐\r\n        │ data: 1    │   │ data: 2    │   │ data: 3    │\r\n null ◄─── :nextNode │ ◄─── :nextNode │ ◄─── :nextNode │   null\r\n        └────────────┘   └────────────┘   └────────────┘\r\n             ▲\r\n ┌───────────│─┐\r\n │ headNode: ┘ │\r\n └─────────────┘\r\n        ↑\r\n       list\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point the reversal is complete, and we could in theory stop here, but two more instructions are executed in this last iteration of the loop, which shift 2 out of 3 references:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n                                                         current\r\n                                            previous       next\r\n                                               ↓            ↓\r\n        ┌────────────┐   ┌────────────┐   ┌────────────┐\r\n        │ data: 1    │   │ data: 2    │   │ data: 3    │\r\n null ◄─── :nextNode │ ◄─── :nextNode │ ◄─── :nextNode │   null\r\n        └────────────┘   └────────────┘   └────────────┘\r\n             ▲\r\n ┌───────────│─┐\r\n │ headNode: ┘ │\r\n └─────────────┘\r\n        ↑\r\n       list\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe loop condition is no longer true (cf `current`), and luckily we still have `previous` referencing the last node of the original list, which is now the head of the reversed list.

I am trying to use the grafana-api-java-client found [here](https://github.com/appnexus/grafana-api-java-client).
