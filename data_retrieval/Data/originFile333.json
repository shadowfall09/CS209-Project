But this makes the `ManagerClass` depend on a test class, `ConnectionMock`, which is not good\r\n\r\nBut I don&#39;t know if there might be a better workaround with mockito or something.

If curl is installed on your machine, you can try deploying an artifact with...*\r\n\r\n- I successfully logged in and out of the sonatype.org website, using the user/pass in `settings.xml`.\r\n- I *attempted* to use `curl` to manually deploy an artifact, with the command\r\n\r\n`[C:\\]curl -u MY_SONATYPE_DOT_COM_USERNAME:MY_SONATYPE_DOT_COM_PASSWORD https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/github/aliteralmind/xbnjava/0.1.2-SNAPSHOT/xbnjava-0.1.2-20140716.224928-1.pom --request PUT --data @pom.xml`\r\n\r\nbut got this error:\r\n\r\n    Warning: Couldn&#39;t read data from file &quot;pom.xml&quot;, this makes an empty POST.\r\n    curl: (60) SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details:\r\n    error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed\r\n    More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html\r\n\r\n    curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a &quot;bundle&quot;\r\n     of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default\r\n     bundle file isn&#39;t adequate, you can specify an alternate file\r\n     using the --cacert option.\r\n    If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in\r\n     the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a\r\n     problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might\r\n     not match the domain name in the URL).\r\n    If you&#39;d like to turn off curl&#39;s verification of the certificate, use\r\n     the -k (or --insecure) option.\r\n\r\nI ran it again with the `-k` option, and this time got only this:\r\n\r\n    Couldn&#39;t read data from file &quot;pom.xml&quot;, this makes an empty POST.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve never used curl before, so I&#39;m at a loss on what to do with this information.\r\n\r\n&gt; **Checklist item 2**. *If there is no error output, ensure your user privileges are correctly configured on the server.  Make sure to drop the repo you just created.*\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know what &quot;drop&quot; means.

would like to configure the [Apache Maven Checkstyle Plugin][1] v3.3.0 with [Apache Maven][2] v3.9.3 in a multi-module project to use the [palantir-java-format][3] style.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve read both [Multimodule Configuration][4] and [Using Custom Developed Checkstyle Checks][8] of the official plugin documentation. As recommended in the documentation I created a separate `jar` Maven project `example-company-config`. The single purpose of `example-company-config` is to provide the Checkstyle config files as resources in a JAR file. B ydoing that the Checkstyle config can be shared across many Maven projects.\r\n\r\n- I was able to make it work with a standalone (i.e. no references to other XML files) `checkstyle.xml` file.\r\n- **But** here is the problem: The [palantir-java-format Checkstyle config][5] uses three files and the `checkstyle.xml` references the other files with a property `config_loc`.\r\n\r\nI found out how to to set that property. The following is a snippet of my Aggregator POM.\r\n\r\n    &lt;build&gt;\r\n        &lt;pluginManagement&gt;\r\n            &lt;plugins&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-checkstyle-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.3.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                    &lt;dependencies&gt;\r\n                        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n                            &lt;groupId&gt;io.github.florianwolters&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n                            &lt;artifactId&gt;example-company-config&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                            &lt;version&gt;0.1.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                            &lt;type&gt;jar&lt;/type&gt;\r\n                            &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/dependencies&gt;\r\n                        &lt;configLocation&gt;io.github.florianwolters/checkstyle/palantir/checkstyle.xml&lt;/configLocation&gt;\r\n                        &lt;propertyExpansion&gt;config_loc=.&lt;/propertyExpansion&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n            &lt;plugins&gt;\r\n        &lt;pluginManagement&gt;\r\n    &lt;build&gt;\r\n\r\n**But:** Since all three Checkstyle files of palantir-java-format are stored inside the JAR file of the `example-company-config` project, this does not work.\r\n\r\nI identified three possible solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Qualify a XML file from another XML file inside the same archive file with a &quot;special syntax&quot;. I don&#39;t think that this syntax exists and therefore that this is not possible.\r\n2. Extract the JAR file of `example-company-config` during the build process and reference to it using an absolute file path.\r\n\r\n   Maybe this is possible with the [Apache Maven Dependency Plugin][9].\r\n3. Turn the `example-company-config` from type `jar` to type `pom` and install the Checkstyle config files manually.\r\n\r\n   Maybe this is possible with the [Apache Maven Assembly Plugin][10].\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- I consider modification of the three Checkstyle config files a non-solution.\r\n- I&#39;m aware that the [Spotless for Maven][6] plugin exists. I do not want to fail the build (yet) in case of formatting violations. Therefore I want to use the palantir-java-format style with the Checkstyle tool. I may migrate from Checkstyle to Spotless later.\r\n\r\nDo you have a solution or some guidance for the problem I&#39;ve described?\r\n\r\nRelated resources:\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/q/19682455/891439\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/q/32436495/891439\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/q/46211370/891439\r\n- [How To: Wie man in Maven seine Checkstyle-Konfiguration zentral verwaltet][7]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin\r\n[2]: https://maven.apache.org\r\n[3]: https://github.com/palantir/palantir-java-format\r\n[4]: https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/examples/multi-module-config.html\r\n[5]: https://github.com/palantir/palantir-java-format/tree/f354703a0b7057255f4740db99377a64e4ddc823/.baseline/checkstyle\r\n[6]: https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-maven\r\n[7]: https://senacor.blog/how-to-wie-man-in-maven-seine-checkstyle-konfiguration-zentral-verwaltet\r\n[8]: https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/examples/custom-developed-checkstyle.html\r\n[9]: https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin\r\n[10]: https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin","title":"How to configure a multi-module Apache Maven project to use a Checkstyle config project that consists of multiple XML files that reference each other?","body":"<p>I would like to configure the <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apache Maven Checkstyle Plugin</a> v3.3.0 with <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apache Maven</a> v3.9.3 in a multi-module project to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/palantir/palantir-java-format\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">palantir-java-format</a> style.</p>\n<p>I've read both <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/examples/multi-module-config.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Multimodule Configuration</a> and <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/examples/custom-developed-checkstyle.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Using Custom Developed Checkstyle Checks</a> of the official plugin documentation.

B ydoing that the Checkstyle config can be shared across many Maven projects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I was able to make it work with a standalone (i.e. no references to other XML files) <code>checkstyle.xml</code> file.</li>\n<li><strong>But</strong> here is the problem: The <a href=\"https://github.com/palantir/palantir-java-format/tree/f354703a0b7057255f4740db99377a64e4ddc823/.baseline/checkstyle\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">palantir-java-format Checkstyle config</a> uses three files and the <code>checkstyle.xml</code> references the other files with a property <code>config_loc</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I found out how to to set that property. The following is a snippet of my Aggregator POM.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;build&gt;\n    &lt;pluginManagement&gt;\n        &lt;plugins&gt;\n            &lt;plugin&gt;\n                &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\n                &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-checkstyle-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n                &lt;version&gt;3.3.0&lt;/version&gt;\n                &lt;dependencies&gt;\n                    &lt;dependency&gt;\n                        &lt;groupId&gt;io.github.florianwolters&lt;/groupId&gt;\n                        &lt;artifactId&gt;example-company-config&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n                        &lt;version&gt;0.1.0&lt;/version&gt;\n                        &lt;type&gt;jar&lt;/type&gt;\n                        &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;\n                    &lt;/dependency&gt;\n                &lt;/dependencies&gt;\n                    &lt;configLocation&gt;io.github.florianwolters/checkstyle/palantir/checkstyle.xml&lt;/configLocation&gt;\n                    &lt;propertyExpansion&gt;config_loc=.&lt;/propertyExpansion&gt;\n                &lt;/configuration&gt;\n            &lt;/plugin&gt;\n        &lt;plugins&gt;\n    &lt;pluginManagement&gt;\n&lt;build&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>But:</strong> Since all three Checkstyle files of palantir-java-format are stored inside the JAR file of the <code>example-company-config</code> project, this does not work.</p>\n<p>I identified three possible solutions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Qualify a XML file from another XML file inside the same archive file with a &quot;special syntax&quot;. I don't think that this syntax exists and therefore that this is not possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Extract the JAR file of <code>example-company-config</code> during the build process and reference to it using an absolute file path.</p>\n<p>Maybe this is possible with the <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apache Maven Dependency Plugin</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Turn the <code>example-company-config</code> from type <code>jar</code> to type <code>pom</code> and install the Checkstyle config files manually.</p>\n<p>Maybe this is possible with the <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apache Maven Assembly Plugin</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I consider modification of the three Checkstyle config files a non-solution.</li>\n<li>I'm aware that the <a href=\"https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-maven\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Spotless for Maven</a> plugin exists. I do not want to fail the build (yet) in case of formatting violations. Therefore I want to use the palantir-java-format style with the Checkstyle tool. I may migrate from Checkstyle to Spotless later.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do you have a solution or some guidance for the problem I've described?</p>\n<p>Related resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/19682455/891439\">how to externalise the checkstyle config for maven-checkstyle-plugin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/32436495/891439\">Can&#39;t configure Checkstyle in Maven multimodule project</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/46211370/891439\">Maven - Dependency on module for Checkstyle not working</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://senacor.blog/how-to-wie-man-in-maven-seine-checkstyle-konfiguration-zentral-verwaltet\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">How To: Wie man in Maven seine Checkstyle-Konfiguration zentral verwaltet</a></li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":["java","rest","single-sign-on","netweaver"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":4077251,"reputation":26288,"user_id":3348604,"display_name":"Jan Garaj"},"score":0,"creation_date":1575047209,"post_id":58948833,"comment_id":104448931,"body_markdown":"How `form based SSO authentication` works?","body":"How <code>form based SSO authentication</code> works?"}],"owner":{"account_id":1044026,"reputation":2141,"user_id":1049391,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"AbhishekB"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":167,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"answer_count":0,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1688391447,"creation_date":1574234618,"question_id":58948833,"body_markdown":"I have a legacy SAP Java application hosted on Neo platform which uses form-based SSO authentication.

the question arose about how to place the back of the site on the server, I decided to use docker, but errors began to occur.\r\nI use MongoDB in my project and probably first of all it needs to be launched, I do everything in via docker-compose.yml?\r\nI run mongo like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nversion: &quot;3.8&quot;\r\nservices:\r\n  mongodb:\r\n    image: mongo:latest\r\n    container_name: mongodb\r\n    restart: unless-stopped\r\n\r\n    ports:\r\n      - &quot;27017:27017&quot;\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - ./database-data:/data/db\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nafter that, I was puzzled by the fact that I would need to connect mongo express and run it like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmongo express:\r\nimage: mongo-express:last\r\ncontainer name: mongo-express\r\nrestart: unless - stopped\r\nports:\r\n- &quot;8081:8081&quot;\r\nenvironment:\r\nME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER: mongodb\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\ninitially, nothing worked, but after watching the video on YouTube everything worked well, mongo-express connected to mongodb\r\n\r\nnext, you need to run a program written in spring. my code is as crooked as possible since I&#39;m studying, but everything works on the locale, I run it in a yml file like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmy-final-app:\r\nbuild: .\r\nrestart: unless-stopped\r\nports:\r\n- &quot;8080:8080&quot;\r\nenvironment:\r\n- spring.data.mongodb.host=mongodb\r\ndepends_on:\r\n- mongodb\r\n```\r\n\r\nand nothing works, everything breaks, I gave an error:\r\n```\r\n.   ____          _            __ _ _\r\n /\\\\ / ___&#39;_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _ \\ \\ \\ \\\r\n( ( )\\___ |

arose about how to place the back of the site on the server, I decided to use docker, but errors began to occur.\nI use MongoDB in my project and probably first of all it needs to be launched, I do everything in via docker-compose.yml?\nI run mongo like this:</p>\n<pre><code>version: &quot;3.8&quot;\nservices:\n  mongodb:\n    image: mongo:latest\n    container_name: mongodb\n    restart:

connected to mongodb</p>\n<p>next, you need to run a program written in spring. my code is as crooked as possible since I'm studying, but everything works on the locale, I run it in a yml file like this:</p>\n<pre><code>my-final-app:\nbuild: .\nrestart: unless-stopped\nports:\n- &quot;8080:8080&quot;\nenvironment:\n- spring.data.mongodb.host=mongodb\ndepends_on:\n- mongodb\n</code></pre>\n<p>and

Now I try to find a way to also map a single nested object.
