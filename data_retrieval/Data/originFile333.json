{\r\n    \r\n        default T base() {\r\n            return null;\r\n\t    }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWe return null since interfaces cannot have state, but this has to be fixed later via a proxy.\r\n\r\nThe developer of extensions would have to extend this interface by a new interface containing extension methods.\r\nLet&#39;s say we want to add a forEach consumer on List interface:\r\n\r\n    public interface ListExtension&lt;T&gt; extends Extension&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; {\r\n\r\n        default void foreach(Consumer&lt;T&gt; consumer) {\r\n\t\t    for (T item : base()) {\r\n\t\t\t    consumer.accept(item);\r\n            }\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBecause we extend the Extension interface, we can call base() method inside our extension method to access the support object we attach to.\r\n\r\nThe Extension interface must have a factory method which will create an extension of a given support object:\r\n\r\n    public interface Extension&lt;T&gt; {\r\n\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n        static &lt;E extends Extension&lt;T&gt;, T&gt; E create(Class&lt;E&gt; type, T instance) {\r\n            if (type.isInterface()) {\r\n                ExtensionHandler&lt;T&gt;

baseType = type.getSuperclass();\r\n                while (baseType != null &amp;&amp; baseType.isInterface()) {\r\n                    interfaces.add(baseType);\r\n                    baseType = baseType.getSuperclass();\r\n                }\r\n                Object proxy = Proxy.newProxyInstance(\r\n                        Extension.class.getClassLoader(),\r\n                        interfaces.toArray(new Class&lt;?&gt;[interfaces.size()]),\r\n                        handler);\r\n                return type.cast(proxy);\r\n            } else {\r\n                return null;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWe create a proxy that implements the extension interface and all the interface implemented by the type of the support object.\r\nThe invocation handler given to the proxy would dispatch all the calls to the support object, except for the &quot;base&quot; method, which must return the support object, otherwise its default implementation is returning null:\r\n\r\n    public class ExtensionHandler&lt;T&gt; implements InvocationHandler {\r\n\r\n        private T instance;\r\n\r\n        private ExtensionHandler(T instance) {\r\n            this.instance = instance;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args)\r\n                throws Throwable {\r\n            if (&quot;base&quot;.equals(method.getName())\r\n                    &amp;&amp; method.getParameterCount() == 0) {\r\n                return instance;\r\n            } else {\r\n                Class&lt;?&gt; type = method.getDeclaringClass();\r\n                MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup()\r\n                    .in(type);\r\n                Field allowedModesField = lookup.getClass().getDeclaredField(&quot;allowedModes&quot;);\r\n                makeFieldModifiable(allowedModesField);\r\n                allowedModesField.set(lookup, -1);\r\n                return lookup\r\n                    .unreflectSpecial(method, type)\r\n                    .bindTo(proxy)\r\n                    .invokeWithArguments(args);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private static void makeFieldModifiable(Field field) throws Exception {\r\n            field.setAccessible(true);\r\n            Field modifiersField = Field.class.getDeclaredField(&quot;modifiers&quot;);\r\n            modifiersField.setAccessible(true);\r\n            modifiersField\r\n                    .setInt(field, field.getModifiers() &amp;

To profit from this support you need to:\r\n\r\n1. Register a [`ThreadLocalAccessor`](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.micrometer/context-propagation/latest/io/micrometer/context/ThreadLocalAccessor.html) that will help transfering the correlation id from Log4j&#39;s `ThreadContext` from and to various context objects:\r\n   ```lang-java\r\n   private static final String CORRELATION_ID = &quot;correlationId&quot;;\r\n   ...\r\n   ContextRegistry.getInstance()\r\n       .registerThreadLocalAccessor(\r\n           CORRELATION_ID,\r\n           () -&gt; ThreadContext.get(CORRELATION_ID),\r\n           v -&gt; ThreadContext.put(CORRELATION_ID, v),\r\n           () -&gt; ThreadContext.remove(CORRELATION_ID)\r\n       );\r\n   ```\r\n1. Add one of the `contextWrite/contextCapture` operators at the end of your `WebClient` chain to capture your correlation id into a Reactor [`Context`](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/util/context/Context.html) object:\r\n   ```lang-java\r\n   webClient.get()\r\n            ...\r\n            .contextCapture();\r\n   ```\r\n1. All Reactor Netty pipelines consist of two parts: a sequence of Reactor operators and a sequence of Netty [`ChannelHandler`](https://netty.io/4.1/api/io/netty/channel/ChannelHandler.html)s.  Reactor operators should automatically restore the thread locals, when they jump between threads. At the moment this does not seems to be the case for tasks started by the Netty part. Since `wiretap` works as a Netty handler, inbound events will **not** have a correlation id (only code executed in the Reactor part will have it). In order to correct that you need to restore the context manually via a `ChannelInboundHandler`:\r\n   ```lang-java\r\n   private static final class ContextInboundHandler extends ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter {\r\n\r\n       private static final ContextSnapshotFactory SNAPSHOT_FACTORY = ContextSnapshotFactory.builder()\r\n           .contextRegistry(ContextRegistry.getInstance())\r\n           .build();\r\n\r\n       private static Scope setThreadLocals(ChannelHandlerContext ctx) {\r\n           return SNAPSHOT_FACTORY.setThreadLocalsFrom(ctx.channel());\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       @Override\r\n       public void channelRegistered(ChannelHandlerContext ctx) throws Exception {\r\n           try (final Scope s = setThreadLocals(ctx)) {\r\n               super.channelRegistered(ctx);\r\n           }\r\n       }\r\n   // Same for all other events\r\n   ...\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n   and add it as first Netty inbound Handler:\r\n   ```lang-java\r\n   final HttpClient httpClient = HttpClient.create()\r\n       .wiretap(true)\r\n       .doOnChannelInit((connectionObserver, channel, remoteAddress) -&gt; {\r\n           channel.pipeline()\r\n               .addFirst(&quot;context&quot;, new ContextInboundHandler());\r\n   });\r\n   final WebClient client = WebClient.builder()\r\n       ...\r\n       .clientConnector(new ReactorClientHttpConnector(httpClient))\r\n       .build();\r\n\r\nSupport for `context-propagation` is quite recent in Reactor Netty.

In order to correct that you need to restore the context manually via a <code>ChannelInboundHandler</code>:\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>private static final class ContextInboundHandler extends ChannelInboundHandlerAdapter {\n\n    private static final ContextSnapshotFactory SNAPSHOT_FACTORY = ContextSnapshotFactory.builder()\n        .contextRegistry(ContextRegistry.getInstance())\n        .build();\n\n    private static Scope setThreadLocals(ChannelHandlerContext ctx) {\n        return SNAPSHOT_FACTORY.setThreadLocalsFrom(ctx.channel());\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void channelRegistered(ChannelHandlerContext ctx) throws Exception {\n        try (final Scope s = setThreadLocals(ctx)) {\n            super.channelRegistered(ctx);\n        }\n    }\n// Same for all other events\n...\n}\n</code></pre>\nand add it as first Netty inbound Handler:\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>final HttpClient httpClient = HttpClient.create()\n    .wiretap(true)\n    .doOnChannelInit((connectionObserver, channel, remoteAddress) -&gt; {\n        channel.pipeline()\n            .addFirst(&quot;context&quot;, new ContextInboundHandler());\n});\nfinal WebClient client = WebClient.builder()\n    ...\n    .clientConnector(new ReactorClientHttpConnector(httpClient))\n    .build();\n\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Support for <code>context-propagation</code> is quite recent in Reactor Netty. It will probably improve in the future.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":345986,"reputation":282,"user_id":679225,"accept_rate":71,"display_name":"mememoremore"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1117,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1688356619,"creation_date":1687052418,"question_id":76498742,"body_markdown":"With the wiretap feature, I can see the log generated when WebClient is doing the request.

It works fine if I use one object to access it. the problem arises when I&#39;m creating a second object. ...&quot;_\r\n\r\nThis is because you are closing the _[System#in](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/System.html#in)_ _[InputStream](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/io/InputStream.html)_ on your initial instance.\r\n\r\nHere is an excerpt from the _JavaDoc_, for _System#in_.\r\n\r\n&gt; _&quot;The &quot;standard&quot; input stream. ... Typically this stream corresponds to keyboard input or another input source specified by the host environment or user. ...&quot;_\r\n\r\nAnd, here is an excerpt from the JavaDoc for _[Scanner#close](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Scanner.html#close())_.\r\n\r\n&gt; _&quot;... if [the] underlying readable also implements the Closeable interface then the readable&#39;s close method will be invoked. ...&quot;_\r\n\r\nThus, the _System#in_ _InputStream_, which implements _[Closeable](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/io/Closeable.html)_, will be closed.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since _System#in_ is static, it will only be assigned the _standard-in_ stream once; whenever that is&amp;mdash;whenever the JVM runs a static initialization on the _System_ class, for your application.  \r\nHere is a relevant discussion on this topic, _[StackOverflow &amp;ndash; When is the out object of the System class initialized in Java?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67868882/17758716)_.\r\n\r\nThus, simply resolving _System#in_ from a new _Scanner_ instance, will actually not produce a new _standard-in_ stream, and will actually be accessing the same _System#in_ instance as the previous invocation.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat confusing, as you would think the _Java_ implementers would have added some type of mechanism to prevent the _System#in_ from being closed.  \r\nI think that a better way to look at it is, it is more logical to allow for it to close&amp;mdash;in terms of design principles.\r\n\r\nEssentially, you will want to call _close_ after all of the _standard-in_ input for your application has been read, because of the way the _Closeable_ design structure works.\r\n\r\nIn this case, supply the _Scanner_ to the _marks_ method, as opposed to instantiating a new _Scanner_ for each _Student#marks_ invocation.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic void marks(Scanner sc)\r\n{\r\n    for(int i=0;i&lt;5;i++)\r\n    {\r\n        System.out.print(&quot;Enter marks of subject &quot;+(i+1)+&quot;: &quot;);\r\n        m[i] = sc.nextInt();\r\n        avg += m[i];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    avg /= 5;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then, you can call each method, from _main_, as follows.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nScanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n\r\nStudent s1 = new Student();\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Enter marks of student 1:&quot;);\r\ns1.marks(sc);\r\n\r\nStudent s2 = new Student();\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Enter marks of student 2:&quot;);\r\ns2.marks(sc);\r\n\r\ns1.display();\r\ns2.display();\r\n\r\nsc.close();\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an example input, and output.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nEnter marks of student 1:\r\nEnter marks of subject 1: 1\r\nEnter marks of subject 2: 2\r\nEnter marks of subject 3: 3\r\nEnter marks of subject 4: 4\r\nEnter marks of subject 5: 5\r\nEnter marks of student 2:\r\nEnter marks of subject 1: 1\r\nEnter marks of subject 2: 2\r\nEnter marks of subject 3: 3\r\nEnter marks of subject 4: 4\r\nEnter marks of subject 5: 5\r\nAverage marks: 3\r\nAverage marks: 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere are some responses from your other inquiries, despite not being directly correlated to the error.\r\n\r\n&gt; _&quot;...

A set can be modelled as an array in the actual implementation, this does not mean anything. In programming challenges it is quite often that people use rather simple structures - like an array instead of `java.util.Set`.\r\n\r\nSo the task is basically:\r\n\r\n&gt; Randomly select a set of `M` elements from an array of size `N`.\r\n\r\nAssuming `N &gt;= M`.\r\n\r\nNow the hard part: why does this algorithm produce the correct results?\r\n\r\nJust looking at the algorithm, it&#39;s hard to understand how it works and why. I think this is because the algorithm is actually constructed recursively, with recursion finall unwrapped in iteration.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s start with the recursion.\r\n\r\nAssume we are able to randomly select `M` elements from an array of size `N - 1`.  How do we select `M` elements from an array of size `N`?\r\n\r\nSince there&#39;s a &quot;new&quot; element in the array, we can either replace one of the selected elements with it - or leave the set as it is. But we have to keep random properties.\r\n\r\nA set of `M` elements from `N-1` can be selected in `(N-1)! / M!*(N-1 - M)!` ways.  \r\nA set of `M` elements from `N` can be selected in `N! / M!*(N - M)!` ways.\r\n\r\nThis means that we should keep the set with the `(N-M)/N` probability and replace one of the elements with `M/N` probability. We will also have to select the element to replace with `1/M` probability.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s see how it will look in the code. Assume `subset` is our randomly selected set of `M` elements out of `N-1`.\r\n\r\nFirst we should decide if we replace one of the elements or not. We need a `(N-M)/N` probability. For this we can just generate a random number between `0` and `N`. If this number is less than `M`, we replace.\r\n\r\n    boolean replace = rand(random, 0, N) &lt; M;\r\n    if (replace) {\r\n       // then replace\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow we have to select one of the elements to replace. Since we model the array as a set, we can simply randomly select an index between `0` and `M - 1` (inclusive). So we get:\r\n\r\n    boolean replace = rand(random, 0, N) &lt; M;\r\n    if (replace) {\r\n       subset[rand(random, 0, M - 1)] = original[N];\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere we can note that if our first random value (`rand(random, 0, N)`) is less than `M`, it *is* a random value between `0` and `M-1`. Thus, we don&#39;t need the second `rand`:\r\n\r\n    int r = rand(random, 0, N);\r\n    boolean replace = r &lt; M;\r\n    if (replace) {\r\n       subset[r] = original[N];\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe rest should be pretty trivial.\r\n\r\nBase case of the recursion is `M == N`. In this case we don&#39;t replace anything so the set of selected elements is simple the original array.\r\n\r\nAfter that the recursion can be simply coded as a cycle. `i` represents `N` on each step - this gives your the code your have.","title":"Generate a set of M elements from an array of size N","body":"<p>First of all, it is quite clear from the explanation and the code that the author meant set, just as they wrote.

But we have to keep random properties.</p>\n\n<p>A set of <code>M</code> elements from <code>N-1</code> can be selected in <code>(N-1)! / M!*(N-1 - M)!</code> ways.<br>\nA set of <code>M</code> elements from <code>N</code> can be selected in <code>N! / M!*(N - M)!</code> ways.</p>\n\n<p>This means that we should keep the set with the <code>(N-M)/N</code> probability and replace one of the elements with <code>M/N</code> probability. We will also have to select the element to replace with <code>1/M</code> probability.</p>\n\n<p>Let's see how it will look in the code. Assume <code>subset</code> is our randomly selected set of <code>M</code> elements out of <code>N-1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>First we should decide if we replace one of the elements or not. We need a <code>(N-M)/N</code> probability. For this we can just generate a random number between <code>0</code> and <code>N</code>. If this number is less than <code>M</code>, we replace.</p>\n\n<pre><code>boolean replace = rand(random, 0, N) &lt; M;\nif (replace) {\n   // then replace\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we have to select one of the elements to replace. Since we model the array as a set, we can simply randomly select an index between <code>0</code> and <code>M - 1</code> (inclusive). So we get:</p>\n\n<pre><code>boolean replace = rand(random, 0, N) &lt; M;\nif (replace) {\n   subset[rand(random, 0, M - 1)] = original[N];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here we can note that if our first random value (<code>rand(random, 0, N)</code>) is less than <code>M</code>, it <em>is</em> a random value between <code>0</code> and <code>M-1</code>. Thus, we don't need the second <code>rand</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int r = rand(random, 0, N);\nboolean replace = r &lt; M;\nif (replace) {\n   subset[r] = original[N];\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The rest should be pretty trivial.</p>\n\n<p>Base case of the recursion is <code>M == N</code>. In this case we don't replace anything so the set of selected elements is simple the original array.</p>\n\n<p>After that the recursion can be simply coded as a cycle. <code>i</code> represents <code>N</code> on each step - this gives your the code your have.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":7612423,"reputation":82486,"user_id":5772882,"display_name":"Anonymous"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1688339050,"creation_date":1530711280,"answer_id":51175006,"question_id":51173120,"body_markdown":"&gt; How can I prove it with math? \r\n\r\nYour second `for` loop runs twice, first with `i` equal to 2, then with `i` equal to 3.\r\n\r\nWhen `i` is 2, `r` becomes 0, 1 or 2, each with probability 1/3.

The name of the internal variable used to hold the property value, in your example, `RegionName`, doesn&#39;t actually matter. By convention in Java you will use always camel case syntax for property names, with the first letter being lowercase, not uppercase such as in C#.\r\n\r\nAs described, the use of the stateful session is not related to the problem.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that, as pointed out by @RoddyoftheFrozenPeas in his comment, you could let Drools trying finding the different rules defined in your classpath.
