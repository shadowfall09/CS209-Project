I do not think any of them are particularly compelling:\r\n\r\n- I&#39;m doing different iteration counts by an order of magnitude in the two languages. — It&#39;s possible I&#39;m grossly misreading the code, but I&#39;m pretty sure this isn&#39;t the case.\r\n- I&#39;ve fudged up the algorithm and am doing vastly different things in each case. — Again maybe I&#39;ve misread it, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s happening, and both cases do produce numerically correct results.\r\n- The timing mechanism I use for C introduces a lot of overhead. — I also tested simpler and no-op functions. They completed and were measured as expected in much less time.\r\n- The JVM code is parallelized across multiple processor cores — With many more iterations, I watched my CPU use over a longer period and it did not exceed one core.\r\n- The JVM code makes better use of SIMD/vectorization. — I compiled the C with `-O3` and `-march=native`, statically linking against libraries from Debian packages. In another case I even tried the `-floop`/`-ftree` parallelization flags. Either way performance didn&#39;t really change.\r\n- GSL has extra features that add overhead in this particular test. — I also have another version, with the vector class implemented and used through Cython, that does only the basics (iterating over a pointer), and performs roughly equivalently to GSL (with slightly more overhead, as expected). So that seems to be the limit for native code.\r\n- JOML is actually using native code. — The README says it makes no JNI calls, I&#39;m importing directly from a multi-platform `.jar` file that I&#39;ve checked and contains only `.class` files, and the JNI adds [~20 Java ops of overhead](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13977914/12260302) to every call so even if it had magical native code that shouldn&#39;t help anyway at such a granular level.\r\n- The JVM has different specifics for floating point arithmetic. — The JOML class I used accepts and returns &quot;doubles&quot; just as the C code. In any case, having to emulate a specification that deviates from hardware capabilities probably shouldn&#39;t improve performance like this.\r\n- The exponential reciprocal step in my GSL code is less efficient than the division reciprocal step in my JOML code. — While commenting that out does reduce total execution time by around 25% (to ~0.045s), that still leaves a massive 3X gap with the JVM code (~0.015s).\r\n\r\nThe only remaining explanation I can think of is that most of the time spent in C is overhead from doing function calls. This would seem consistent with the fact that implementations in C and Cython perform similarly. Then, the performance advantage of the Java/Kotlin/JVM implementation comes from its JIT being able to optimize away the function calls by effectively inlining everything in the loop. However, given the reputation of JIT compilers as being only *theoretically*, slightly faster than native code in favourable conditions, that still seems like a massive speedup just from having a JIT.\r\n\r\nI suppose if that is the case, then a follow-up question would be whether I could realistically or reliably expect these performance characteristics to carry over outside of a synthetic toy benchmark, in applications that may have much more scattered numeric calls rather than a single million-iteration loop.\r\n","title":"Why is this JOML (JVM) code so much faster than the equivalent GSL (C)?","body":"<p>I am attempting to optimize a small library for doing arithmetic on vectors.</p>\n<p>To roughly check my progress, I decided to benchmark the performance of two popular vector arithmetic libraries written in two different languages, the GNU Scientific Library (GSL, C), and the Java OpenGL Math Library (JOML, JVM).

I do not think any of them are particularly compelling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm doing different iteration counts by an order of magnitude in the two languages. — It's possible I'm grossly misreading the code, but I'm pretty sure this isn't the case.</li>\n<li>I've fudged up the algorithm and am doing vastly different things in each case. — Again maybe I've misread it, but I don't think that's happening, and both cases do produce numerically correct results.</li>\n<li>The timing mechanism I use for C introduces a lot of overhead. — I also tested simpler and no-op functions. They completed and were measured as expected in much less time.</li>\n<li>The JVM code is parallelized across multiple processor cores — With many more iterations, I watched my CPU use over a longer period and it did not exceed one core.</li>\n<li>The JVM code makes better use of SIMD/vectorization. — I compiled the C with <code>-O3</code> and <code>-march=native</code>, statically linking against libraries from Debian packages. In another case I even tried the <code>-floop</code>/<code>-ftree</code> parallelization flags. Either way performance didn't really change.</li>\n<li>GSL has extra features that add overhead in this particular test. — I also have another version, with the vector class implemented and used through Cython, that does only the basics (iterating over a pointer), and performs roughly equivalently to GSL (with slightly more overhead, as expected). So that seems to be the limit for native code.</li>\n<li>JOML is actually using native code. — The README says it makes no JNI calls, I'm importing directly from a multi-platform <code>.jar</code> file that I've checked and contains only <code>.class</code> files, and the JNI adds <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/13977914/12260302\">~20 Java ops of overhead</a> to every call so even if it had magical native code that shouldn't help anyway at such a granular level.</li>\n<li>The JVM has different specifics for floating point arithmetic. — The JOML class I used accepts and returns &quot;doubles&quot; just as the C code. In any case, having to emulate a specification that deviates from hardware capabilities probably shouldn't improve performance like this.</li>\n<li>The exponential reciprocal step in my GSL code is less efficient than the division reciprocal step in my JOML code. — While commenting that out does reduce total execution time by around 25% (to ~0.045s), that still leaves a massive 3X gap with the JVM code (~0.015s).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only remaining explanation I can think of is that most of the time spent in C is overhead from doing function calls. This would seem consistent with the fact that implementations in C and Cython perform similarly. Then, the performance advantage of the Java/Kotlin/JVM implementation comes from its JIT being able to optimize away the function calls by effectively inlining everything in the loop. However, given the reputation of JIT compilers as being only <em>theoretically</em>, slightly faster than native code in favourable conditions, that still seems like a massive speedup just from having a JIT.</p>\n<p>I suppose if that is the case, then a follow-up question would be whether I could realistically or reliably expect these performance characteristics to carry over outside of a synthetic toy benchmark, in applications that may have much more scattered numeric calls rather than a single million-iteration loop.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3466983,"reputation":8589,"user_id":3800782,"accept_rate":77,"display_name":"rghome"},"score":2,"creation_date":1665069987,"post_id":73976030,"comment_id":130618074,"body_markdown":"Do you have a debugger?","body":"Do you have a debugger?"},{"owner":{"account_id":2671330,"reputation":183386,"user_id":2308683,"accept_rate":90,"display_name":"OneCricketeer"},"score":0,"creation_date":1665070897,"post_id":73976030,"comment_id":130618456,"body_markdown":"It&#39;d be useful to explain your code/algorithm in words rather than say &quot;I have a problem; here&#39;s the code&quot;.

Meanwhile, a dummy merger like `(a, b) -&gt; b` would hide the fact that data is being processed and then thrown away.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s also worth to be aware:\r\n\r\n* that while performing calculations with `double` your result might appear to be non-accurate because this type inherently incapable to represent precisely fractions which are not power of `2`. For that reason, some data might be lost. If your `bigfunction()` does a lot of calculations and loosing precision is not acceptable, you might consider using [`BigDecimal`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/math/BigDecimal.html), but keep in mind that computations would become much heavier.\r\n\r\n* Another important thing to consider is that *collector* [`toConcurrentMap()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Collectors.html#toConcurrentMap(java.util.function.Function,java.util.function.Function,java.util.function.BinaryOperator,java.util.function.Supplier)) expects a **concurrent** implementation of `Map` (credits to *@DuncG* for spotting this).

You are resetting `Click1` and `Click2` to *black* every time method `actionPerformed` is invoked, i.e. every time a `JButton` is clicked.\r\n\r\nYou obviously want `Click1` to keep the color it was assigned when variable `Click1_turn` was *true*.\r\n\r\nTherefore you should make both `Click1` and `Click2` class member variables, so that they keep their assigned values **between** separate calls to `actionPerformed`.\r\n\r\nIf you run your code through a debugger, you will discover this.

Instead, you can iterate over the given `String` examining each character using method `String.charAt()`.\r\n\r\nThe idea of using ASCII codes isn&#39;t nice from the perspective of readability of code. And more over, using magic numbers `96` and `64` directly in the code is a huge red flag. Avoid doing this, it&#39;s very error-prone.\r\n\r\nConversely, the characters `&#39;A&#39;` and `&#39;a&#39;` from the perspective of clean-coding are quite self-descriptive, and therefore could be used directly in the code without even introducing a variable.\r\n\r\nAccording to the problem description, the value of `k` is guaranteed to be non-negative. That simplifies the problem - we should deal only with cases when `&#39;Z&#39;` turns into `&#39;A&#39;` (or subsequent letter after `&#39;A&#39;`), but not the opposite.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the *encrypted character*, we need to calculate the **difference** between the initial character and `&#39;A&#39;` (or `&#39;a&#39;`) add `k` and apply modulo (`%`) `26` (which is the length of English alphabet).

However, what I'm trying to achieve is that <strong>I want to be able to send another data to the server from the client side to find another Product.</strong> So, what efficient way can I write my code to do this?</p>\n<p>Here is the <strong>App.java (Server)</strong></p>\n<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {\n    System.out.println(new App().getGreeting());\n\n    Socket socket = null;\n    InputStreamReader inputStreamReader = null;\n    OutputStreamWriter outputStreamWriter = null;\n    BufferedReader bufferedReader = null;\n    BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = null;\n    ServerSocket serverSocket = null;\n    File selectedFile = new File(&quot;src/main/java/pos_server/products.txt&quot;);\n\n    try {\n        serverSocket = new ServerSocket(3005);\n    } catch (IOException e1) {\n        e1.printStackTrace();\n    }\n\n    while (true) {\n        try {\n            socket = serverSocket.accept();\n\n            inputStreamReader = new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream());\n            outputStreamWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream());\n            bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(inputStreamReader);\n            bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(outputStreamWriter);\n\n            while (true) {\n                // Reads the message from client\n                String msgFromClient = bufferedReader.readLine();\n\n                System.out.println(&quot;Client: &quot; + msgFromClient);\n\n                String[] separatedInput = msgFromClient.split(&quot;,&quot;, 2);\n\n                // Add to Cart\n                // Input expected is &quot;findProduct,[productID]&quot;\n                if (separatedInput[0].equals(&quot;findProduct&quot;)) {\n                    try(Scanner scanner = new Scanner(selectedFile)) {\n                        scanner.useDelimiter(&quot;;&quot;);\n                        Boolean productFound = false;\n                        while(scanner.hasNext()) {\n                            String scannedText = scanner.next();\n                            String[] s = scannedText.split(&quot;,&quot;);\n                            Integer scannedID = Integer.parseInt(s[0]);\n\n                            if(Objects.equals(Integer.parseInt(separatedInput[1]), scannedID)){\n                                bufferedWriter.write(&quot;Product:&quot; + scannedText);\n                                bufferedWriter.newLine();\n                                System.out.println(&quot;Product found!&quot;);\n                                productFound = true;\n                                break;\n                            }  \n                            scanner.nextLine();\n                        }\n                        if (!productFound) {\n                            bufferedWriter.write(&quot;Product not found.&quot;);\n                            bufferedWriter.newLine();\n                        }\n                    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n                        e.printStackTrace();\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // Saving Transaction\n                // if (separatedInput[0].equals(&quot;saveTransaction&quot;)) {\n                //     // store the transaction somewhere\n                // }\n\n                // Sends message to client\n                bufferedWriter.flush();\n\n                if (msgFromClient.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;BYE&quot;)) {\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            socket.close();\n            inputStreamReader.close();\n            outputStreamWriter.close();\n            bufferedReader.close();\n            bufferedWriter.close();\n            serverSocket.close();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is the <strong>index.js(Client)</strong></p>\n<pre><code>const net = require(&quot;net&quot;)\nconst prompt = require(&quot;prompt-sync&quot;)()\nconst readlineSync = require(&quot;readline-sync&quot;);\nconst colors = require(&quot;colors&quot;);\nvar HOST = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;\nvar PORT = 3005;\n\nvar client = null;\n\n// For Opening/Starting connection\nfunction OpenConnection(){\nif(client){\n    console.log(&quot;--Connection is already open--&quot;.red);\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        menu();\n    }, 0);\n    return;\n}\n\nclient = new net.Socket();\nclient.on(&quot;error&quot;, function (err) {\n    client.destroy();\n    client = null;\n    console.log(&quot;ERROR: Connection could not be started.

Is this possible?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>2 example: Another case that I would like to address is what would happen if I am receiving bytes on the server from the client and I make another request (echo), so the same socket would be listening x2 (can i read bytes from the same socket simultaneously?
