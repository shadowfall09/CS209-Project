An additional transport of my logger makes use of <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-custom-events-metrics#tracktrace\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">TrackTrace()</a> to transfer the logs. In my Node.js backend logs from Bunyan even are <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/nodejs#automatic-third-party-instrumentation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">collected automatically</a> by Application Insights by means of a monkey patch applied to Bunyan at runtime.</p>\n<p>I'm searching for a similar solution for my Android Logs. Since these logs from my point of view aren't auto-collected, I'd by happy if there was something like <code>TrackTrace()</code> which I can implement in a custom logger class. However, it appears that I can only track events.</p>\n<p>I'd appreciate any help!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","docker","maven","testcontainers","jib"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":322981,"reputation":310745,"user_id":642706,"accept_rate":58,"display_name":"Basil Bourque"},"score":0,"creation_date":1663136705,"post_id":73711539,"comment_id":130165103,"body_markdown":"Poor title.

Or rather, conceptually it just doesn&#39;t apply.\r\n\r\nSaying: &quot;This static method is an override&quot; is a bit like stating: &quot;This smells blue&quot; - it&#39;s not clear what that would even mean.\r\n\r\noverriding is relevant essentially only for the notion of dynamic dispatch. Dynamic dispatch is this idea:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Dog {\r\n  void bark() { System.out.println(&quot;Woof&quot;); }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Bulldog extends Dog {\r\n  void bark() { System.out.println(&quot;Grrrr&quot;); }\r\n}\r\n\r\nDog d = new Bulldog();\r\nd.bark(); // prints &quot;Grrrr&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s dynamic dispatch at work. `d` is a variable.  Like all non-primitives in java, it is _a reference_. Meaning, values stored in this variable are _the reference_ - a pointer. An address in an addressbook that lets you get _to_ a house, not the house itself. `d`&#39;s type is `Dog`. Its value is a _reference_ to an actual instance of some object (and java guarantees that whatever the actual type it is an instance of, that type is `Dog` or a subtype of `Dog`). That reference gets you an instance of `Bulldog`. So, when invoking `bark()` here, what happens?\r\n\r\nDynamic dispatch: Java finds the _most specific_ implementation of this method, and calls _that_. So that prints `Grrrr`, and not `Woof`.\r\n\r\nHowever, when talking about static methods, the entire concept doesn&#39;t apply. Dynamic dispatch occurs because there is a discrepancy between the type of the _reference_ (which is `Dog` here, that&#39;s the type of variable `d`) and the type of the _thing the reference is pointing at_ (which is `Bulldog`). Overriding as a concept exists because these 2 types may not be the same.\r\n\r\nWhen invoking static methods, __this doesn&#39;t come up__. You always write `SomeType.someStaticMethod()`, so what would dynamic dispatch even be?\r\n\r\nSIDENOTE: You can legally invoke static methods using an expression. This is legal:\r\n\r\n```\r\nList.of(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;); // this is how you normally do it\r\nList&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();\r\nlist.of(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;); // this compiles and works\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut make no mistake - the compiler treats it the same and cares _only_ about the type of `list`, not about the object the variable is pointing at. In fact, `list = null; list.of(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;);` works fine, no NullPointerException, proving the point that `list` doesn&#39;t get dereferenced when you do this. All style guides strongly recommend not doing this, for good reason.\r\n\r\nSIDENOTE 2: Unfortunately java lets you declare a static method as `final` which is weird: `final` means: Cannot be overridden, and we just figured out that &#39;override&#39; conceptually doesn&#39;t make sense for static methods. It&#39;s just what it is - it&#39;s a design error in the original java spec and java does not like making changes that break existing code unless there is an incredibly good reason to do so, and whilst this spec brainfart is annoying, it doesn&#39;t hurt much. Just don&#39;t declare your static methods `final`. It even adds a rule (subtypes cannot declare a static method with the same signature) which is even more bizarre. Again, disregard that - java spec error that doesn&#39;t get fixed because not worth the headache.\r\n\r\n&gt; And is redefining the same as overriding?\r\n\r\nYes. 2 words for the same thing. The correct term is &#39;override&#39; - both the java lang spec uses this term, and the vast majority of the community does. If I was an editor of whatever tutorial, blogpost, documentation, or presentation you got this &#39;redefine&#39; term from, I&#39;d edit it. Unless the author was specifically talking about this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Parent {\r\n  static void foo() {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Child extends Parent {\r\n  static void foo() {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn which case &#39;override&#39; is the wrong term to use (given that static methods and override are orthogonal concepts), though I wouldn&#39;t use &#39;redefine&#39; either. You&#39;re just defining a method named `foo` in one class, and also defining a method named `foo` in another. The fact that one is a child of the other is irrelevant; both have a `foo` method now. The foo method in child does not override or redefine anything; there&#39;s no such thing in `static` world.\r\n\r\n&gt; with a flowchart\r\n\r\nA flowchart requires some sort of flow to chart. Hence the name. No such thing here.\r\n","title":"Overriding, redeclaring, hiding and redefining of methods in classes, interfaces and classes implementing interfaces","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>Would it be correct to say that static methods in a class extended</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No. static methods fundamentally are un-inheritable, and un-overridable.

So that prints <code>Grrrr</code>, and not <code>Woof</code>.</p>\n<p>However, when talking about static methods, the entire concept doesn't apply. Dynamic dispatch occurs because there is a discrepancy between the type of the <em>reference</em> (which is <code>Dog</code> here, that's the type of variable <code>d</code>) and the type of the <em>thing the reference is pointing at</em> (which is <code>Bulldog</code>). Overriding as a concept exists because these 2 types may not be the same.</p>\n<p>When invoking static methods, <strong>this doesn't come up</strong>. You always write <code>SomeType.someStaticMethod()</code>, so what would dynamic dispatch even be?</p>\n<p>SIDENOTE: You can legally invoke static methods using an expression. This is legal:</p>\n<pre><code>List.of(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;); // this is how you normally do it\nList&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();\nlist.of(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;); // this compiles and works\n</code></pre>\n<p>But make no mistake - the compiler treats it the same and cares <em>only</em> about the type of <code>list</code>, not about the object the variable is pointing at. In fact, <code>list = null; list.of(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;);</code> works fine, no NullPointerException, proving the point that <code>list</code> doesn't get dereferenced when you do this. All style guides strongly recommend not doing this, for good reason.</p>\n<p>SIDENOTE 2: Unfortunately java lets you declare a static method as <code>final</code> which is weird: <code>final</code> means: Cannot be overridden, and we just figured out that 'override' conceptually doesn't make sense for static methods. It's just what it is - it's a design error in the original java spec and java does not like making changes that break existing code unless there is an incredibly good reason to do so, and whilst this spec brainfart is annoying, it doesn't hurt much. Just don't declare your static methods <code>final</code>. It even adds a rule (subtypes cannot declare a static method with the same signature) which is even more bizarre. Again, disregard that - java spec error that doesn't get fixed because not worth the headache.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And is redefining the same as overriding?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes. 2 words for the same thing. The correct term is 'override' - both the java lang spec uses this term, and the vast majority of the community does. If I was an editor of whatever tutorial, blogpost, documentation, or presentation you got this 'redefine' term from, I'd edit it. Unless the author was specifically talking about this:</p>\n<pre><code>class Parent {\n  static void foo() {}\n}\n\nclass Child extends Parent {\n  static void foo() {}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In which case 'override' is the wrong term to use (given that static methods and override are orthogonal concepts), though I wouldn't use 'redefine' either. You're just defining a method named <code>foo</code> in one class, and also defining a method named <code>foo</code> in another. The fact that one is a child of the other is irrelevant; both have a <code>foo</code> method now. The foo method in child does not override or redefine anything; there's no such thing in <code>static</code> world.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>with a flowchart</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A flowchart requires some sort of flow to chart. Hence the name. No such thing here.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":25629509,"reputation":1,"user_id":19400093,"display_name":"Oyst"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":172,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1663336522,"accepted_answer_id":73733543,"answer_count":1,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1663329447,"creation_date":1663251971,"question_id":73732925,"body_markdown":"Would it be correct to say that static methods in a class extended with a class, in an interface extended with an interface and in an interface implemented by a class can only be redeclared in the extending/implementing part (hiding the original method in the class extending class case), and any other method can only be overridden there?

Basically, wait()/notify() is like sleep()/interrupt(), only the active thread does not need a direct pointer to the sleeping thread, but only to the shared lock object.</p>\n\n<pre><code>synchronized(LOCK) {   \n   Thread.sleep(1000); // LOCK is held\n}\n\nsynchronized(LOCK) {   \n   LOCK.wait(); // LOCK is not held\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let categorize all above points :</p>\n\n<p><code>Call on:</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>wait():</strong> Call on an object; current thread must synchronize on the lock object.</li>\n<li><strong>sleep():</strong> Call on a Thread; always currently executing thread.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><code>Synchronized:</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>wait():</strong> when synchronized multiple threads access same Object one by one.</li>\n<li><strong>sleep():</strong> when synchronized multiple threads wait for sleep over of sleeping thread.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><code>Hold lock:</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>wait():</strong> release the lock for other objects to have chance to execute.</li>\n<li><strong>sleep():</strong> keep lock for at least t times if timeout specified or somebody interrupt.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><code>Wake-up condition:</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>wait():</strong> until call notify(), notifyAll() from object</li>\n<li><strong>sleep():</strong> until at least time expire or call interrupt().</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><code>Usage:</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>sleep():</strong> for time-synchronization and;</li>\n<li><strong>wait():</strong> for multi-thread-synchronization.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ref:<a href=\"http://howtodoinjava.com/2013/03/08/difference-between-sleep-and-wait/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">diff <code>sleep</code> and <code>wait</code></a></p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":40502,"reputation":151,"user_id":117374,"display_name":"negora"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1391102112,"creation_date":1391102112,"answer_id":21463078,"question_id":1036754,"body_markdown":"In my opinion, the main difference between both mechanisms is that sleep/interrupt is the most basic way of handling threads, whereas **wait/notify is an abstraction aimed to do thread inter-communication easier.** This means that sleep/interrupt can do anything, but that this specific task is harder to do.\r\n\r\nWhy is wait/notify more suitable?

Please select just one.\n    at org.springframework.beans.factory.support.SimpleInstantiationStrategy.instantiate(SimpleInstantiationStrategy.java:185)\n    at org.springframework.beans.factory.support.ConstructorResolver.instantiate(ConstructorResolver.java:653)\n    ... 21 common frames omitted\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Found WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter as well as SecurityFilterChain. Please select just one.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Many thanks for reading. I'd be very grateful for any suggestions / guidance as to how to proceed so that I can have both authentication providers sitting side by side in my code, with the ability to switch between them with a configuration setting.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","kubernetes","livenessprobe","crashloopbackoff"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2731857,"reputation":63,"user_id":2355463,"display_name":"Atiq"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1617499602,"creation_date":1617499602,"answer_id":66937276,"question_id":66937168,"body_markdown":"I found this explanation in an article:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed containers that are restarted by the kubelet are restarted with an exponential back-off delay (10s, 20s, 40s …) capped at five minutes, and is reset after ten minutes of successful execution. \r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks like its an expected behavior.

For a <code>Map&lt;String, Payload&gt;</code> we are comparing primitive types and so if do a <code>map.put(&quot;key1&quot;, payload1)</code>, followed by a <code>map.get(&quot;key1&quot;)</code>, I&quot;ll get my key.</p>\n<p>This wouldn't work if my key is of the type <code>Map&lt;MyEnumKey, Payload&gt;</code>, unless I override the <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> methods.</p>\n<p>In my situation, the key I have currently is an <code>enum</code> like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Map&lt;MyEnumKey, String&gt; map = Map.of(\n    MyEnumKey.FIRST_KEY, &quot;payload1&quot;\n    MyEnumKey.SECOND_KEY, &quot;payload2&quot;\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>But I'd like the map to be able to store more than 1 enum as the key. So something like a <code>List&lt;MyEnumKey&gt;</code> makes sense.</p>\n<pre><code>Map&lt;..., String&gt; map = Map.of(\n    (MyEnumKey.FIRST_KEY, MyEnumKey.SOME_KEY), &quot;payload1&quot;\n    MyEnumKey.SECOND_KEY, &quot;payload2&quot;\n);\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this situation, what can be the best way to define the map without creating a separate class that encapsulates a <code>List&lt;MyEnumKey&gt;</code> and then overriding the <code>equals</code> and <code>hashcode</code>?

The problem occurred with Amazon Corretto 8 and 11 compilers.\nAfter removing the duplicate private void function, the java compiler started generating sources as before.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":279220,"reputation":2393,"user_id":574263,"accept_rate":44,"display_name":"mjaggard"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1663321294,"creation_date":1663321294,"answer_id":73742891,"question_id":48462234,"body_markdown":"`javac` appears to completely and silently skip annotation processing for some parse failures.\r\n\r\nFor me a duplicated annotation caused by a merge mistake caused thousands of failures because my annotation processors didn&#39;t run - so the real error got completely lost.\r\n\r\n    @Data @AllArgsConstructor @NoArgsConstructor @EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = false)\r\n    @EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = false)","title":"Javac not running annotation processors","body":"<p><code>javac</code> appears to completely and silently skip annotation processing for some parse failures.</p>\n<p>For me a duplicated annotation caused by a merge mistake caused thousands of failures because my annotation processors didn't run - so the real error got completely lost.</p>\n<pre><code>@Data @AllArgsConstructor @NoArgsConstructor @EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = false)\n@EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = false)\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":384599,"reputation":1379,"user_id":741217,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"Rolf W."},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":3235,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"answer_count":3,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1663321294,"creation_date":1516973098,"question_id":48462234,"body_markdown":"## Problem\r\nI&#39;m revisiting a maven project that I haven&#39;t touched in at least a year.

This is peculiar because the parent's layout should not change again.<br/>\nHowever that be, a little if/else logic solves the endless calls.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>  private int counter = 0;\n  @Override\n  public void onGlobalLayout() {\n    // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n\n    /* Width and height on this time are known */\n\n    int width  = mGridLayout.getWidth();\n    int height = mGridLayout.getHeight();\n\n    /* Buttons width and height are supposed to be */\n\n    int mButtons_width  = width;\n    int mButtons_height = height / 2;\n\n    if(!(mButtonAbove.getWidth()  == mButtons_width  &amp;&amp;\n         mButtonAbove.getHeight() == mButtons_height &amp;&amp;\n         mButtonBelow.getWidth()  == mButtons_width  &amp;&amp;\n         mButtonBelow.getHeight() == mButtons_height)\n      ){\n\n      /* Changes the LayoutParams of ContentViews children dynamicly */\n\n      mGridLayout_LayoutParams_Above.width = mButtons_width;\n      mGridLayout_LayoutParams_Above.height = mButtons_height;\n\n      mGridLayout_LayoutParams_Below.width = mButtons_width;\n      mGridLayout_LayoutParams_Below.height = mButtons_height;\n\n      /* NO ISSUE ANYMORE:\n       * updates the rendering of the buttons */\n\n      mButtonAbove.requestLayout();\n      mButtonBelow.requestLayout();\n\n    }\n\n    /* A little debug info for knowing the ContentView's and Children's size */\n\n    mButtonBelow.setText(\"Own Width = \" + mButtonBelow.getWidth() + \"\\n\" + \n                         \"Own Height = \" + mButtonBelow.getHeight() + \"\\n\" +\n                         \"Perents Width = \" + width + \"\\n\" +\n                         \"Perents Height = \" + height + \"\\n\" +\n                         \"Calls = \" + counter++);\n\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case I use the <code>OnGlobalLayoutListener</code> instead of the <code>OnLayoutChangeListener</code>/<code>uiHandler</code> Combination. ;-) The if/else logic is the same.</p>\n\n<p>My original question, why <code>requestLayout</code> does not work in <code>onLayoutChange</code>, is still open but a satisfying solution was presented here so I am happy.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you again for your concern!</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":15314235,"reputation":1,"user_id":11048563,"display_name":"loopq"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1575368743,"creation_date":1575367330,"answer_id":59154481,"question_id":25329934,"body_markdown":"handler is dangerous.suggest use &lt;br/&gt;`view.getViewTreeObserver().addOnPreDrawListener();`\r\n\r\n\r\n**this is not conflict;**","title":"Android - View.requestLayout doesn&#39;t work in OnLayoutChangeListener","body":"<p>handler is dangerous.suggest use <br/><code>view.getViewTreeObserver().addOnPreDrawListener();</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>this is not conflict;</strong></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":4282052,"reputation":427,"user_id":3501103,"accept_rate":83,"display_name":"Barock"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":11554,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":10,"accepted_answer_id":25392659,"answer_count":3,"score":10,"last_activity_date":1663317505,"creation_date":1408118690,"question_id":25329934,"body_markdown":"I have to use the `GridLayout` for my application.

One would be to take something like a normal distribution but that might lead to values outside your range. You could discard those samples and try again, but doing so would alter your mean. So this is probably the more complicated approach.\r\n\r\nThe other alternative, the one I would actually suggest, is to start with a uniform distribution in the range 0 to 1. Then transform that number so the result has the properties you want.\r\n\r\nThere are many such transformations you could employ. In the absence of any strong rationale for something else, I would probably go for some formula such as\r\n\r\n    y = pow(x, a) * b + c\r\n\r\nIn that formula `x` would be uniformly distributed in the [0, 1] range, while `y` should have the bounds and mean you want, once the three parameters have been tuned correctly.\r\n\r\nUsing `b=400` and `c=100` you can match the endpoints quite easily, because a number from the [0, 1] range raised to any power will again be a number from that range. So now all you need is determine `a`. Reversing the effect of `b` and `c` you want `pow(x, a)` to have an mean of (150 - c) / b = 1/8 = 0.125.\r\n\r\nTo compute the mean (or [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value)) in a discrete distribution, you multiply each value with its probability and sum them up. In the case of a continuous distribution that becomes the integral over value times probability density function. The density function of our uniform distribution is 1 in the interval and 0 elsewhere. So we just need to integrate `pow(x, a)` from 0 to 1. The result of that is 1 / (a + 1) so you get\r\n\r\n```\r\n1 / (a + 1) = 1 / 8\r\n     a + 1  =     8\r\n     a      =     7\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo taking it all together I&#39;d suggest\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn Math.pow(random.nextDouble(), 7) * 400 + 100\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to get a feeling for this distribution, you can consider\r\n\r\n    x = pow((y - c) / b, 1 / a)\r\n\r\nto be the cumulative distribution function. The density would be the derivative of that with respect to `y`. Ask a computer algebra system and you get some ugly formula. You might as well ask directly for a plot, e.g. on [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=plot+derivative+of+pow%28%28y+-+100%29+%2F+400%2C+1+%2F+7%29+from+100+to+500).\r\n\r\nThat probability density is actually infinite at 100, and then drops quickly for larger values. So one thing you don&#39;t get from this approach is a density maximum at 150. If you had wanted that, you&#39;d need a different approach but getting both density maximum and expected value at 150 feels really tricky.\r\n\r\nOne more thing to consider would be reversing the orientation. If you start with `b=-400` and `c=500` you get `a=1/7`. That&#39;s a different distribution, with different properties but the same bounds and mean. If I find the time I&#39;ll try to plot a comparison for both of these.","title":"How to generate a random number in Java between x and y where the mean is m?","body":"<p>I can think of two possible approaches you might take.

Make sure to implement <code>equals</code> and <code>hashcode</code> in your DTOs properly therefore!</p>\n<p>And for the first call to <code>mapper.map</code> you don't need a rule what to return, but you should <code>verify</code> that it was called correctly.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: example for my suggested method:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Test\nvoid updateWithSuccess() {\n    final long userId = 1L;\n\n    // not using the builders here just because I didn't want to implement them but used records instead.\n    UpdateUserDTO requestUpdateUserDTO = new UpdateUserDTO(18f,36f);\n    User userFromDB = new User(33L, &quot;ssn&quot;, 17f, 35f);\n    UserDTO response = new UserDTO(33L, 18f, 36f);\n\n    Mockito.doReturn(Optional.of(userFromDB)).when(repository).findById(userId);\n    Mockito.doReturn(userFromDB).when(repository).save(userFromDB);\n    Mockito.doReturn(response).when(mapper).map(userFromDB, UserDTO.class);\n    Mockito.doNothing().when(mapper).map(requestUpdateUserDTO, userFromDB);\n\n    UserDTO result = service.update(userId, requestUpdateUserDTO);\n\n    Assertions.assertEquals(response, result);\n    Mockito.verify(mapper).map(requestUpdateUserDTO, userFromDB);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I suppose that the result from <code>repository.findById</code> is returned by <code>service.getUserById</code>.\nYou also could use mocks for your User and UserDTO instances, but I used records for easier of rebuilding your test and as they are <code>final</code> the effort to mock them would be higher.</p>\n<p>The problem you have in your test is that you use <code>doReturn</code> for the mocking of <code>mapper.map(requestUpdateUserDTO, userFromDB)</code>, but this method does not return the new value, instead it modifies the second parameter. This is not supported by mocks - and not necessary for a test. You can just verify that the method was called (remember: you neither want to test the correct behaviour nor configuration of the ModelMapper with this test!)</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":12977358,"reputation":373,"user_id":11766857,"display_name":"Caroline"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":690,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":73731066,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1663311701,"creation_date":1663240850,"question_id":73730219,"body_markdown":"I have an `User` class:\r\n```\r\npublic class User {\r\n   private Long id;\r\n   private String ssn;\r\n   private float height;\r\n   private float weight;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd an `UpdateUserDTO` class:\r\n```\r\npublic class UpdateUserDTO {\r\n   private float height;\r\n   private float weight;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd an `UserDTO` class:\r\n```\r\npublic class UserDTO {\r\n   private Long id;\r\n   private float height;\r\n   private float weight;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve used `Model Mapper` to map the updated fields from `updateUserDTO` to `user`, which comes from the DB.\r\n```\r\n@Service\r\npublic class UserServiceImpl implements UserService {\r\n\r\n    private final UserRepository repository;\r\n    private final ModelMapper mapper;\r\n\r\n    public UserDTO update(long userId, UpdateUserDTO updateUserDTO) {\r\n        User user = getUserById(userId);\r\n        mapper.map(updateUserDTO, user);\r\n        user = repository.save(user);\r\n        return mapper.map(user, UserDTO.class);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy test class looks like this:\r\n```\r\n@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)\r\nclass UserServiceTest {\r\n\r\n    @InjectMocks\r\n    private UserServiceImpl service;\r\n\r\n    @Mock\r\n    private ModelMapper mapper;\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void updateWithSuccess() {\r\n        long userId = 1L;\r\n\r\n        UpdateUserDTO requestUpdateUserDTO = UpdateUserDTO.builder().height(1f).weight(1f).build();\r\n        User userFromDB = User.builder().id(1L).ssn(&quot;123&quot;).height(50f).weight(50f).build();\r\n        User userAfterMap = User.builder().id(1L).ssn(&quot;123&quot;).height(50f).weight(50f).build();\r\n        UserDTO response = UserDTO.builder().id(1L).height(50f).weight(50f).build();\r\n\r\n        Mockito.when(repository.findById(userId)).thenReturn(Optional.of(userFromDB));\r\n        Mockito.when(mapper.map(requestUpdateUserDTO, userFromDB)).thenReturn(userAfterMap);\r\n        Mockito.when(repository.save(userFromDB)).thenReturn(userFromDB);\r\n        Mockito.when(mapper.map(userFromDB, UserDTO.class)).thenReturn(response);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    service.update(userId, requestUpdateUserDTO);\r\n\r\n    ArgumentCaptor&lt;User&gt; userCaptor = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(User.class);\r\n\r\n    assertEquals(requestUpdateUserDTO.getHeight(), userCaptor.getValue().getHeight());\r\n    assertEquals(requestUpdateUserDTO.getWeight(), userCaptor.getValue().getWeight());\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nBut the first `Mockito.when()` line does not even compile, because `mapper.map()` is a `void` method, so it does not expect any return values.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also tried:\r\n```\r\nMockito.when(mapper.map(any(), any())).thenReturn(updatedUser);\r\n```\r\nWhich does compile, but the `mapper.map()` doesn&#39;t work at all.

To fix that, it would be best to store the <code>ObjectMapper</code> instance in a field and initialize it with the class creation (injection) - both in the actual code and in the tests:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>class Handler {\n\n    private ObjectMapper objectMapper;\n\n    Handler(ObjectMapper objectMapper) {\n        this.objectMapper = objectMapper;\n    }\n    \n    public ResponseType handleRequest(Object object) {\n        // use the objectMapper here\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thanks to that you can pass the mocked <code>ObjectMapper</code> in the test to the tested object constructor:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Test\npublic void handleRequest() {\n    ObjectMapper mapper = mock(ObjectMapper.class);\n    when(mapper.convertValue(object, ResponseType.class)).thenReturn(response);\n\n    new Handler(mapper).handleRequest(object);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Other ways of doing that could be using a factory providing the <code>ObjectMapper</code>, also mocked in the tests, or (not recommended) using <a href=\"https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/Mockito.html#49\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mockito-inline with it's mockConstruction method (since Mockito 3.5.0)</a>.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":14342927,"reputation":41,"user_id":10360596,"display_name":"Sparrow"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1232,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":73741030,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1663311496,"creation_date":1663272164,"question_id":73736799,"body_markdown":"I am getting this exception - ```java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No serializer found for class org.mockito.internal.creation.bytebuddy.ByteBuddyCrossClassLoaderSerializationSupport and no properties discovered to create BeanSerializer (to avoid exception, disable SerializationFeature.FAIL_ON_EMPTY_BEANS) (through reference chain: org.mockito.codegen.Object$MockitoMock$[&quot;mockitoInterceptor&quot;]-&gt;org.mockito.internal.creation.bytebuddy.MockMethodInterceptor[&quot;serializationSupport&quot;])```\r\n\r\nThe Testcase I&#39;m writing looks like this\r\n```\r\n@Mock\r\nObject object;\r\n\r\n@Mock\r\nResponseType response;\r\n\r\n@Test\r\npublic void handleRequest() {\r\n    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n    when(mapper.convertValue(object, ResponseType.class)).thenReturn(response)\r\n    new Handler().handleRequest(object);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe method I&#39;m trying to test: \r\n```\r\npublic class Handler{\r\n\r\n    public ResponseType handleRequest(Object object) {\r\n        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n        ResponseType response = mapper.convertValue(object, ResponseType.class);\r\n        return response;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI see that I can disable SerializationFeature.FAIL_ON_EMPTY_BEANS, but I have no control over the base class, I can only write a test case.
