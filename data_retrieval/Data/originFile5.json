Furthermore, I was hoping to implement a system where I could pass in an end vertex alongside my start vertex to the dijkstra method and have my code just output the travel path from my start vertex to my end vertex. How do I go about resolving my issue and implementing this functionality. I have been at this for the whole day and I cannot figure out where the issue lies in the code I have presented. I understand that this question was answered using another method in another post, but I would really like to know where I went wrong in my own code.\r\n\r\n","title":"Dijkstra Search Algorithm Implementation","body":"<p>So I have this class GraphUtility which handles all my inputs for a graph system I am creating.

I can do this when I am in a single application execution, and I use the PrivateKey from the same KeyPair that generated the PublicKey.  However, I want to encrypt the value in one application, and decrypt the value in another application.  Basically I have a web service sending value I do not want to be tampered with to an application, and I was planning to use asymmetric encryption to handle it.  Feel free to let me know if I am going about solving that the wrong way.\r\n\r\nI have tried various encryption techniques, starting with Symmetric.  The issue I ran into with that is that the value is encrypted to the same text each time - not very useful if my goal is to keep someone from tampering with a value - once they know the encrypted version of some text, they will be able to use that in any request.  I have been trying to follow the standards here - https://www.veracode.com/blog/research/encryption-and-decryption-java-cryptography\r\nI can get all my examples working in a single transaction doing

So once I try to match a PrivateKey that came from one KeyPair to the text that was encrypted with an entirely different KeyPair, it fails.  But I have yet to find how you are supposed to otherwise achieve this in that case.","title":"How can I decrypt text from one application in another application with asymmetric encryption?","body":"<p>I am trying to understand how I can decrypt a String in one application that I have encrypted in a separate application.  I can do this when I am in a single application execution, and I use the PrivateKey from the same KeyPair that generated the PublicKey.  However, I want to encrypt the value in one application, and decrypt the value in another application.  Basically I have a web service sending value I do not want to be tampered with to an application, and I was planning to use asymmetric encryption to handle it.  Feel free to let me know if I am going about solving that the wrong way.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried various encryption techniques, starting with Symmetric.  The issue I ran into with that is that the value is encrypted to the same text each time - not very useful if my goal is to keep someone from tampering with a value - once they know the encrypted version of some text, they will be able to use that in any request.  I have been trying to follow the standards here - <a href=\"https://www.veracode.com/blog/research/encryption-and-decryption-java-cryptography\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.veracode.com/blog/research/encryption-and-decryption-java-cryptography</a>\nI can get all my examples working in a single transaction doing the encrypt/decrypt - it is just when I try to encrypt in one request, and decrypt in a second request that I fail.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my current working example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package com.ni.apps.cartencryptutil;\n\nimport

This is a really useful property that goes with a lot of different names: read-only, immutable, finality, const-ness, observer, purity, and probably others. \r\n\r\n**Why it is useful**\r\n\r\n- If you know that there is no possibility of others changing something, there are a lot less downsides to giving access or sharing it.\r\n\r\n- If a whole object is immutable, there is no longer that much of a difference between sharing the original and sharing copies. This may save a lot of space by avoiding copies.\r\n\r\n- Immutable things never break when several threads are accessing them at once, because all threads will see the same values.\r\n\r\n- It is a lot easier to reason about how things change when there is a very small set of places in which they _can_ change. Immutability helps you keep that set small.\r\n\r\n**How to get immutability in classes and methods in Java**\r\n\r\nFirst, let us assume that your class can only be modified via access to its methods (= no public attributes, and no use of reflection to gain access to privates)\r\n\r\n- A class is immutable if no methods can modify its state; that is, no setters, and all other methods can only read state and/or copy state to a _new_ object. For example, the JDK&#39;s [BigDecimal](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html) are immutable: `a.add(b)` returns a new `BigDecimal`, but does not modify either `a` or `b`.\r\n\r\n- A method can be said to be `read only`, or `const` (especially in the C++ world), or `observer`, when it is guaranteed not to change the state of an object. Some languages, most notably C++, have a keyword for this (`const`). In others (Java) it is up to the documentation to clarify whether or not the internal state will change.\r\n\r\n**Other types of immutability in Java**\r\n\r\n- `static` methods have no underlying object, and cannot modify what they do not have. It does not make much sense to call them immutable, though.\r\n\r\n- `final` next to a `class` declaration prevents subclassing of classes. It does not make them immutable, but it does make it harder to (by subclassing) break the immutability of a class.\r\n\r\n- `final` next to an *attribute* declaration ensures that the attribute&#39;s value cannot be changed once initialized. This allows you to make those attributes `public` without compromising immutability, for example. A better use would be to make it abundantly clear, in an immutable class, that there will be no modifications to those attributes.\r\n\r\n- `enum` in Java builds special classes that have only a given set of members, a set which cannot be modified at run-time. It is a sort of generalization of the concept of singletons.","title":"Read only classes/methods","body":"<p>Something is read-only if it cannot be modified (or, in a weaker sense, cannot be observed to have been modified).

That is as expected. However, by default it uses a lineLength of 80 characters, whereas google_style_java uses 100 characters. I would like to change checkstyle to use 100 characters, which I did by adding a `checkstyle.xml` file with content:\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE module PUBLIC\r\n        &quot;-//Checkstyle//DTD Checkstyle Configuration 1.3//EN&quot;\r\n        &quot;https://checkstyle.org/dtds/configuration_1_3.dtd&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;module name=&quot;Checker&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;!-- Configure the line length check with a maximum limit of 80 characters --&gt;\r\n    &lt;module name=&quot;LineLength&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;property name=&quot;max&quot; value=&quot;80&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/module&gt;\r\n&lt;/module&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\nand enabling: `args: [&quot;-c&quot;, &quot;checkstyle.xml&quot;]`. \r\n\r\n## Issue\r\nHowever, the latter configuration makes checkstyle **only** check for lineLength. To resolve this, I could create a custom checkstyle configuration with all the checks that checkstyle supports. However, that is quite labour intensive, and more importantly, it requires me to manually update the configuration if checkstyle updates.

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>As the details tab states, I have tried installing different versions, changing file locations, added the file to the library, and that is mainly it, I have tried adding lines of code within the program, but they seem to break the thing entirely.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","swing"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3595277,"reputation":44036,"user_id":3000206,"accept_rate":98,"display_name":"Carcigenicate"},"score":10,"creation_date":1702141046,"post_id":77632089,"comment_id":136861693,"body_markdown":"Likely because the window is so narrow there&#39;s no room to show the title.","body":"Likely because the window is so narrow there&#39;s no room to show the title."},{"owner":{"account_id":108033,"reputation":17201,"user_id":286934,"display_name":"Progman"},"score":3,"creation_date":1702141184,"post_id":77632089,"comment_id":136861710,"body_markdown":"You might not want to extend from `JFrame`, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15867148/why-do-we-need-to-extend-jframe-in-a-swing-application","body":"You might not want to extend from <code>JFrame</code>, see <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15867148/why-do-we-need-to-extend-jframe-in-a-swing-application\" title=\"why do we need to extend jframe in a swing application\">stackoverflow.com/questions/15867148/&hellip;</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":31180,"reputation":29173,"user_id":85421,"display_name":"user85421"},"score":0,"creation_date":1702148588,"post_id":77632089,"comment_id":136862488,"body_markdown":"have you tried to maximize it?","body":"have you tried to maximize it?"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":44852,"reputation":322224,"user_id":131872,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"camickr"},"score":0,"creation_date":1702223067,"post_id":77634379,"comment_id":136867526,"body_markdown":"(1-) Don&#39;t use setPreferredSize() to manually control the size of components.

Let&#39;s break it down:\r\n\r\n### Lesser known java aspect 1: `byte`, `short`, `char`, and `boolean` are inferior\r\n\r\nIn java, `byte`, `short`, `char`, `boolean` are the __inferior__ primitives, with `int`, `long`, `double` and `float` being the __superior__ primitives. There are no opcodes for the inferiors beyond array store and array load. __There is no opcode in java that adds 2 bytes together. It just does not exist.__. It is literally impossible to do this, given that `javac` has no idea what to generate. So, instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbyte b = 5;\r\nbyte c = 10;\r\nbyte d = b + c;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs actually taken to mean:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbyte b = 5;\r\nbyte c = 10;\r\nbyte d = (int) b + (int) c;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, thus, this is a compiler error - the result of `int + int` is `int`, and trying to assign an `int` to a `byte` is not allowed without explicit casting.\r\n\r\nYou can trivially have a look at any [list of java bytecodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_bytecode_instructions). You&#39;ll find FADD, DADD, IADD, and LADD (respectively, &#39;float add&#39;, &#39;double add&#39;, &#39;int add&#39; and &#39;long add&#39;). But you won&#39;t find byte/short/char variants; there is no BADD, CADD, or SADD.\r\n\r\n### Lesser known java aspect 2: The compound assignment operators auto-cast.\r\n\r\nthis: `a += b;` is not actually identical to `a = a + b;` at all! I know that&#39;s what you were taught, but this is incorrect. It is, in fact, equal to `a = (byte) (a + b);` where that `byte` is the type of `a` itself:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndouble d = 5.5;\r\nint x = 5;\r\nx = x + d; // obviously, compiler error. Explicit cast needed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nversus:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndouble d = 5.5;\r\nint x = 5;\r\nx += d;\r\n```\r\n\r\nTotally legal. And results in x being 10. The full flow is:\r\n\r\n* x is 5. This is converted to `double` because java can only do math between 2 things of the same type.\r\n* `d` is 5.5, already a double, nice.\r\n* `DADD` bytecode is executed; the result of this is 10.5.\r\n* This is cast to `int`, resulting in `10`, which is assigned to `x`.\r\n\r\nRun `javap` if you want to see this.\r\n\r\n## Combining the two\r\n\r\nThus, let&#39;s break down your code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbyte b = (byte) -1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes the int -1 (32 &#39;1&#39; bits), then casts it to byte, resulting in `b` having the value `1111 1111`. So far, so good, nothing surprising here.\r\n\r\n```\r\nb &gt;&gt;&gt;= 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHoo boy. This looks simple but is very complicated. It&#39;s syntax sugar for:\r\n\r\n```\r\nb = (byte) (((int) b) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo break _that_ down:\r\n\r\n* `(int) b` results in 32 1-bits. `b` is -1 in byte, casting that to int produces -1 the int, which is 32 1-bits.\r\n* `&gt;&gt;&gt; 1` then makes that a zero, followed by 31 1 bits.\r\n* this is then cast back to a byte, which.. is -1 - 8 1-bits.\r\n\r\n### So how do I do this?\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t use `byte`, basically. Don&#39;t ever use the inferior primitives except under the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n* You use them in signatures (i.e. the return type or param types of methods) as API doc, essentially.\r\n* You make an array. `byte[]` _is_ useful and really does only take 1 byte per item.\r\n\r\nFor all other things (such as single fields, and local vars aimed at math, such as what you are doing), __don&#39;t__. They don&#39;t act like you think they act, as you have found out here.\r\n\r\nJust go with ints. If you want an &#39;unsigned byte&#39;, just make an `int` variable and use that:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbyte b = (byte) -1;\r\nint x = b &amp; 0xFF; // x is now 0000...0000 1111 1111.\r\nSystem.out.println(x); // prints 255\r\nx &gt;&gt;= 1;\r\nSystem.out.println(x); // prints 127\r\n```\r\n\r\n`byte` as a single value (not `byte[]` - just `byte`) __is not more efficient in any way__ than `int` or likely even `long`, on 64-bit architecture. Java does not assign less memory (because all things have to align on word boundaries), the operation is not faster (CPUs work in 64-bit chunks already).","title":"Why does b &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 always equals -1 when b is a byte and has value -1 in Java?","body":"<p>You're running into a chain of really weird java design choices that make this code 'lie' (it <em>appears</em> to do one thing but it actually won't do that thing).

But for the remaining 10 exceptions, I need to send a message like <code>&quot;network error occured while trying to access&quot;+url</code>.

I suppose there is no generic solution for this in pure-java because name of function does not always follow JNI naming convention and can be registered manually via `RegisterNatives`. So You cannot just create interface for JNA in runtime and use it. If you are not afraid of C/++ and most importantly managing library distribution, specific platform compilation and loading, you can try to lookup pointer to native function from Method(not java Method, see `RegisterNatives` implementation) object, construct contract from java signature and then call it using JNI/JNA. All that being said, I did not find pure-java solution. Still, if you know corresponding native method, you can try several things. \r\n\r\nFor example, lets look at `Thread.sleep` method (I wanted to instrument it initially).\r\n\r\n## First solution\r\n\r\nWait several years. Now it is not native anymore and you can instrument it! Problem is solved!\r\n\r\n## Second solution\r\n\r\nReplace method with pure-java. You can search for similar method like `parkNanos` and build solution around it (handling &quot;no reason&quot; part too) or block current thread using wait and schedule task in utility thread to wake up current thread via notify. Messy. And you can get different exception during interrupt. Of course there is a problem - how to find replacement and what to do if you want to instrument the replacement too.\r\n\r\nI used this method and had 2 branches - AllowRedefinitionToAddDeleteMethods enabled or not. Now I need to consider first solution and add third branch.\r\n\r\n## Third solution\r\n\r\nSuppose you found native method name and it is `JVM_Sleep`. Now you can use JNA to call it. Just add dependency and then declare interface like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface ThreadWrapper extends com.sun.jna.Library {\r\n    void JVM_Sleep(JNIEnv env, Class thisObj, long nanos) throws InterruptedException;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen call it like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThreadWrapper lib = com.sun.jna.Native.load(&quot;jvm&quot;, ThreadWrapper.class, Collections.singletonMap(Library.OPTION_ALLOW_OBJECTS, Boolean.TRUE));\r\nlong nanos = MILLISECONDS.toNanos(millis);\r\nlib.JVM_Sleep(JNIEnv.CURRENT, Thread.class, nanos);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimple solution but requires knowledge about method name, new quite heavy dependency and introduces additional ovehead on JNA.\r\n**Oh, one more thing - `JVM_Sleep` changed contract between versions so it receives millis in older versions and nanos it newer. Of course you should be aware of it and have `if` for that.**\r\n\r\n## Forth solution\r\n\r\nJava now has foreign functions API and we can use it to call JNI methods.\r\nMain advantage - new API does not need any dependencies. \r\nMain disadvantage - new API does not really have nice and clean bridge to old JNI functions. \r\nStill you can do it like that (error handling are out of scope of example):\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic void invokeJvmSleepFull(long millis) {\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Start &quot; + new Date());\r\n    try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {\r\n        Linker linker = Linker.nativeLinker();\r\n        SymbolLookup jvmLib = SymbolLookup.libraryLookup(&quot;jvm&quot;, arena);\r\n\r\n        // use JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs to get address of running VM\r\n        MemorySegment jniGetCreatedVmsAddr = jvmLib.find(&quot;JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs&quot;).get();\r\n        FunctionDescriptor jniGetCreatedVmsSig =\r\n                FunctionDescriptor.of(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT,\r\n                        ValueLayout.ADDRESS,\r\n                        ValueLayout.JAVA_INT,\r\n                        ValueLayout.ADDRESS\r\n                );\r\n        MethodHandle jniGetCreatedVms = linker.downcallHandle(jniGetCreatedVmsAddr, jniGetCreatedVmsSig);\r\n        MemorySegment writtenVmsCount = arena.allocate(ValueLayout.OfInt.JAVA_INT, 0);\r\n        MemorySegment writtenVms = arena.allocateArray(ValueLayout.ADDRESS, 2);\r\n        int code = (int) jniGetCreatedVms.invokeExact(writtenVms, 2, writtenVmsCount);\r\n        if (code != JNI_OK) {\r\n            throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Unexpected code &quot; + code);\r\n        }\r\n        MemorySegment jvmAddress = writtenVms.get(ValueLayout.ADDRESS, 0);\r\n\r\n        // navigate through JavaVM_ -&gt; functions (aka JNIInvokeInterface_) -&gt; GetEnv to get Env address\r\n        StructLayout JavaVM_Layout = MemoryLayout.structLayout(\r\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;functions&quot;)\r\n        ).withName(&quot;JavaVM_&quot;);\r\n        long functionsOffset = JavaVM_Layout.byteOffset(MemoryLayout.PathElement.groupElement(&quot;functions&quot;));\r\n        MemorySegment functionsAddr = jvmAddress.reinterpret(JavaVM_Layout.byteSize()).get(ValueLayout.ADDRESS, functionsOffset);\r\n\r\n        StructLayout JNIInvokeInterface_Layout = MemoryLayout.structLayout(\r\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;reserved0&quot;),\r\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;reserved1&quot;),\r\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;reserved2&quot;),\r\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;DestroyJavaVM&quot;),\r\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;AttachCurrentThread&quot;),\r\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;DetachCurrentThread&quot;),\r\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;GetEnv&quot;),\r\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;AttachCurrentThreadAsDaemon&quot;)\r\n        ).withName(&quot;JNIInvokeInterface_&quot;);\r\n        long getEnvOffset = JNIInvokeInterface_Layout.byteOffset(MemoryLayout.PathElement.groupElement(&quot;GetEnv&quot;));\r\n        MemorySegment jniGetEnvAddr = functionsAddr.reinterpret(JNIInvokeInterface_Layout.byteSize()).get(ValueLayout.ADDRESS, getEnvOffset);\r\n\r\n        FunctionDescriptor jniGetEnvSig =\r\n                FunctionDescriptor.of(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT,\r\n                        ValueLayout.ADDRESS,\r\n                        ValueLayout.ADDRESS,\r\n                        ValueLayout.JAVA_INT\r\n                );\r\n        MethodHandle jniGetEnv = linker.downcallHandle(jniGetEnvAddr, jniGetEnvSig);\r\n        MemorySegment envAddress = arena.allocate(ValueLayout.ADDRESS);\r\n        code = (int) jniGetEnv.invokeExact(jvmAddress, envAddress, JNI_VERSION_21);\r\n        if (code != JNI_OK) {\r\n            throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Unexpected code &quot; + code);\r\n        }\r\n        envAddress = envAddress.get(ADDRESS, 0);\r\n\r\n        // use env to call JVM_Sleep.

And it introduces new problems - it is preview feature, it requires knowledge about structure of `JavaVM_` and `JNIInvokeInterface_` and I am not sure if it is possible to lookup `jclass` through FFI without going native.","title":"Instrument native method in java 13+","body":"<p>Not exactly the full answer but maybe will help someone.

Of course you should be aware of it and have <code>if</code> for that.</strong></p>\n<h2>Forth solution</h2>\n<p>Java now has foreign functions API and we can use it to call JNI methods.\nMain advantage - new API does not need any dependencies.\nMain disadvantage - new API does not really have nice and clean bridge to old JNI functions.\nStill you can do it like that (error handling are out of scope of example):</p>\n<pre><code>public void invokeJvmSleepFull(long millis) {\n    System.out.println(&quot;Start &quot; + new Date());\n    try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {\n        Linker linker = Linker.nativeLinker();\n        SymbolLookup jvmLib = SymbolLookup.libraryLookup(&quot;jvm&quot;, arena);\n\n        // use JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs to get address of running VM\n        MemorySegment jniGetCreatedVmsAddr = jvmLib.find(&quot;JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs&quot;).get();\n        FunctionDescriptor jniGetCreatedVmsSig =\n                FunctionDescriptor.of(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT,\n                        ValueLayout.ADDRESS,\n                        ValueLayout.JAVA_INT,\n                        ValueLayout.ADDRESS\n                );\n        MethodHandle jniGetCreatedVms = linker.downcallHandle(jniGetCreatedVmsAddr, jniGetCreatedVmsSig);\n        MemorySegment writtenVmsCount = arena.allocate(ValueLayout.OfInt.JAVA_INT, 0);\n        MemorySegment writtenVms = arena.allocateArray(ValueLayout.ADDRESS, 2);\n        int code = (int) jniGetCreatedVms.invokeExact(writtenVms, 2, writtenVmsCount);\n        if (code != JNI_OK) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Unexpected code &quot; + code);\n        }\n        MemorySegment jvmAddress = writtenVms.get(ValueLayout.ADDRESS, 0);\n\n        // navigate through JavaVM_ -&gt; functions (aka JNIInvokeInterface_) -&gt; GetEnv to get Env address\n        StructLayout JavaVM_Layout = MemoryLayout.structLayout(\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;functions&quot;)\n        ).withName(&quot;JavaVM_&quot;);\n        long functionsOffset = JavaVM_Layout.byteOffset(MemoryLayout.PathElement.groupElement(&quot;functions&quot;));\n        MemorySegment functionsAddr = jvmAddress.reinterpret(JavaVM_Layout.byteSize()).get(ValueLayout.ADDRESS, functionsOffset);\n\n        StructLayout JNIInvokeInterface_Layout = MemoryLayout.structLayout(\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;reserved0&quot;),\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;reserved1&quot;),\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;reserved2&quot;),\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;DestroyJavaVM&quot;),\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;AttachCurrentThread&quot;),\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;DetachCurrentThread&quot;),\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;GetEnv&quot;),\n                POINTER.withName(&quot;AttachCurrentThreadAsDaemon&quot;)\n        ).withName(&quot;JNIInvokeInterface_&quot;);\n        long getEnvOffset = JNIInvokeInterface_Layout.byteOffset(MemoryLayout.PathElement.groupElement(&quot;GetEnv&quot;));\n        MemorySegment jniGetEnvAddr = functionsAddr.reinterpret(JNIInvokeInterface_Layout.byteSize()).get(ValueLayout.ADDRESS, getEnvOffset);\n\n        FunctionDescriptor jniGetEnvSig =\n                FunctionDescriptor.of(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT,\n                        ValueLayout.ADDRESS,\n                        ValueLayout.ADDRESS,\n                        ValueLayout.JAVA_INT\n                );\n        MethodHandle jniGetEnv = linker.downcallHandle(jniGetEnvAddr, jniGetEnvSig);\n        MemorySegment envAddress = arena.allocate(ValueLayout.ADDRESS);\n        code = (int) jniGetEnv.invokeExact(jvmAddress, envAddress, JNI_VERSION_21);\n        if (code != JNI_OK) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Unexpected code &quot; + code);\n        }\n        envAddress = envAddress.get(ADDRESS, 0);\n\n        // use env to call JVM_Sleep.

Tomorrow, we might\r\n&gt; introduce a new type of ConcreteObserver and that observer might need\r\n&gt; a different set of values.  So we have to come back here and change\r\n&gt; the Observer interface; we may have to introduce a new parameter, or\r\n&gt; we may have to change the object that is passed over here. we have to\r\n&gt; introduce new fields in that class. \r\n\r\n&gt; So this approach is not very\r\n&gt; flexible, because the Subject is making assumptions about these\r\n&gt; Observers; it&#39;s assuming that these Observers need these values when a\r\n&gt; change happens.  Now, what if each observer needs a different set of\r\n&gt; values?

If someone is found to be abusing the system, you can use the presence of that rule to ban them. For others, insisting on the user providing an email address, phone number or postal address – and guarding against duplicates – may be sufficient (although none of these checks are hard to bypass).\r\n\r\nFor banking and financial applications (such as yours), more stringent efforts must be made. Typically, something like _National Insurance_ (NI) numbers (in the UK) or _Social Security Numbers_ (SSN) in the US are used (and, presumably, similar &quot;ID numbers&quot; for the rest of the world). Legal requirements to &quot;know your customer&quot; generally make asking for such details acceptable.\r\n\r\nWhatever method you use, because &quot;having two phones&quot; is no barrier to an attacker, you need your systems to be able to effectively defend against one user setting up two accounts from two separate devices.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### The Bonus\r\n\r\nIf you have sufficiently strong defenses against one user using two phones to create two accounts, then _at no extra cost_ you will – as far as I can see – have defended against the more specific &quot;one phone; two accounts&quot; scenario that you are asking about. _Yes_ Samsung&#39;s _Secure Area_ will allow a user to install your application a second time on a single phone, but when they come to create or register an account, your _existing_ measures will prevent this in the same way as if they were using two separate phones.\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot think of a way at the moment, I&#39;ll concede that it&#39;s _just about conceivable_ that there is some _very specific_ threat that _only_ occurs when two instances of your application are installed on the same phone using Samsung&#39;s _Secure Area_.

Then you need you `DoPing` class to implement `CallableFunction` like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class DoPing implements CallableFunction&lt;String, String&gt; {\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic String call(final String ipToPing) throws Exception {\r\n\t\tfinal var ipAddress = InetAddress.getByName(ipToPing);\r\n\t\tfinal var reachable = ipAddress.isReachable(1400);\r\n\t\tString pingOutput = null;\r\n\t\tif (reachable) {\r\n\t\t\tpingOutput = ipToPing + &quot; is reachable.\\n&quot;;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\telse {\r\n\t\t    final var ping = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(&quot;ping &quot; + ipToPing + &quot; -n 1 -w 300&quot;);\r\n\t\t    try (var in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(ping.getInputStream()))) {\r\n\t\t\t    String line;\r\n\t\t\t    for (int lineCount = 1; (line = in.readLine()) != null; ++lineCount) {\r\n\t\t\t        if (lineCount == 3) {\r\n\t\t\t            pingOutput = &quot;Ping to &quot; + ipToPing + &quot;: &quot; + line + &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n\t\t\t            break;\r\n\t\t\t        }\r\n\t\t\t    }\r\n\t\t    }\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn pingOutput;\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we changed `call` signature to accept `String` argument and also now it implements `CallableFunction` and not `Callable` as before.

Other changes are minor, but it's worth mentioning, that we prevented resource leak with use of try-with-resource on <code>BufferedReader</code> and also <code>break</code> has been added to input collecting loop (change from <code>while</code> to <code>for</code>) to terminate as quickly, as possible.</p>\n<p>Now you can use the code e.g. like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>    final var ping = CallableFunction.callable(new DoPing(), &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;);\n    final var task = new FutureTask&lt;&gt;(ping);\n    new Thread(task).start();\n    System.out.println(task.get(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS));\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also reuse <code>CallableFunction</code> in other cases, when you needed it.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":8154208,"reputation":4189,"user_id":6140314,"display_name":"Mohamed Anees A"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1611342674,"creation_date":1611342674,"answer_id":65851356,"question_id":9992992,"body_markdown":"I know it is super-late to answer this, considering it is more than 8 years old but active 15 days(!) ago, I feel this will still help someone using Java 8 and above.\r\n\r\nPS, it is simply a syntactic sugar of Victor Sorokin&#39;s answer possible through lambdas.\r\n\r\n    public static Callable&lt;String&gt; generateCallableWithArg(final String input) {\r\n        return () -&gt; {\r\n          Thread.sleep(5000); // someExpensiveOperationHere\r\n          return &quot;Return Value of &quot; + input; //input can be used here\r\n        };\r\n      }\r\n\r\nAlso, we can write a static helper method that can convert a Function to Callable.\r\n\r\n    public class CallableGenerator {\r\n    \r\n      public static &lt;T,V&gt; Callable&lt;V&gt; getCallableFromFunction(Function&lt;T, V&gt; function, T input) {\r\n        return () -&gt; function.apply(input);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis can be used as \r\n\r\n\r\n    Callable&lt;Integer&gt; iAmCallable = CallableGenerator.getCallableFromFunction(i1 -&gt; i1 * 2, 3);\r\n","title":"Is there a way to take an argument in a callable method?","body":"<p>I know it is super-late to answer this, considering it is more than 8 years old but active 15 days(!) ago, I feel this will still help someone using Java 8 and above.</p>\n<p>PS, it is simply a syntactic sugar of Victor Sorokin's answer possible through lambdas.</p>\n<pre><code>public static Callable&lt;String&gt; generateCallableWithArg(final String input) {\n    return () -&gt; {\n      Thread.sleep(5000); // someExpensiveOperationHere\n      return &quot;Return Value of &quot; + input; //input can be used here\n    };\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also, we can write a static helper method that can convert a Function to Callable.</p>\n<pre><code>public class CallableGenerator {\n\n  public static &lt;T,V&gt; Callable&lt;V&gt; getCallableFromFunction(Function&lt;T, V&gt; function, T input) {\n    return () -&gt; function.apply(input);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This can be used as</p>\n<pre><code>Callable&lt;Integer&gt; iAmCallable = CallableGenerator.getCallableFromFunction(i1 -&gt; i1 * 2, 3);\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1654385,"reputation":1608,"user_id":1524303,"display_name":"site"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1702174560,"creation_date":1702174560,"answer_id":77633499,"question_id":9992992,"body_markdown":"If you create your own custom callable very similar to Callable except that call() accepts arguments for your situation as desired and as such is not compatible with Callable.
