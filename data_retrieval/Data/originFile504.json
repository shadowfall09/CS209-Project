(it is not as easy as e.g. `my.custom.datasource.*` config ;( \r\n\r\nWith:\r\n```\r\n@Bean\r\n@Primary // ! for auto config, we need one primary (whether it is &quot;spring.jackson&quot;  ... adjust;)\r\n@ConfigurationProperties(&quot;spring.jackson&quot;)\r\nJacksonProperties springJacksonProps() {\r\n  return new JacksonProperties();\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Bean\r\n@ConfigurationProperties(&quot;foo.jackson&quot;)\r\nJacksonProperties fooProps() {\r\n  return new JacksonProperties();\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Bean\r\n@ConfigurationProperties(&quot;bar.jackson&quot;)\r\nJacksonProperties barProps() {\r\n  return new JacksonProperties();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwe can already load and differentiate (full blown) config like:\r\n```lang-properties\r\nspring.jackson.locale=en_US\r\nspring.jackson.time-zone=UTC\r\n# ... all of spring.jackson @see org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jackson.JacksonProperties\r\nfoo.jackson.locale=en_US\r\nfoo.jackson.time-zone=PST\r\n# ... just for demo purpose\r\nbar.jackson.locale=de_DE\r\nbar.jackson.time-zone=GMT+1\r\n```\r\nAnd also (no problem) pass them (props) to the according (static `[foo|bar]Mapper`) methods.... but then? (If you are good with it, you can stop reading here!:)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the [according (&quot;state of art&quot;) code][4] (to wire `JacksonProperties` with &quot;om builder&quot;) is not public (i.e. not extendable/pluggable).\r\n\r\nInstead the auto configuration provides (if none defined/`@ConditionalOnMissingBean`):\r\n- a *prototype* `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder` bean, which (everytime when requested):\r\n  - applies (i.e. receives) customization from all (known) `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilderCustomizer` beans.\r\n  - of which [one (auto configured, order(0), package private) is the &quot;standard&quot;][4] responsible for wiring (spring.jackson.* only) `JacksonProperties` to `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder`...\r\n\r\nSo the the simplest approach seems (up-to-date) to:\r\n- steel/adopt [the code][4] (not-/implementing `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilderCustomizer`)\r\n- construct (from &quot;stolen&quot; + properties) according builders/mappers, as see fit.\r\n\r\ne.g. (review+TEST before PROD!) non-interface, returns a `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder`, mimic the auto-configured, without applying (other) customizers/-ation:\r\n```lang-java\r\n// ...\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.Module; // !!

Tomee9 here is relevant because otherwise I&#39;d just be using javaEE libraries with a newer JDK target and call it a day. However, due to class names mismatching (mainly EJB interceptors), I get ClassNotFound exceptions when trying to deploy my WAR. \r\n\r\nMy app relies pretty heavily on old JavaEE code. I&#39;m talking Ejb for injects, javax.ws.rs for webclients, javax.servlets, etc. The ejb migration was painless. Just had to swap the namespace and that was it. A few others required a dependency such as jakarta mail. \r\n\r\nSo one of the first things I did when trying to migrate, replaced the tomEE javaEE (so javaEE-api) with \r\n\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.tomee&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jakartaee-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;10.0-M1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n            &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\nThis immediately caused issues, which makes sense. Red everywhere due to missing deps. I used the IntelliJ refactor tool, which replaces all Javax namespaces with Jakarta. \r\n\r\nHowever, that&#39;s when I realized plenty of my libraries were still using Javax namespaces. To name a few, Auth0:\r\n\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;com.auth0&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;mvc-auth-commons&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;1.9.2&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\nIs relying on Javax servlets and Javax HTTP requests. Adding:\r\n\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;jakarta.ws.rs&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jakarta.ws.rs-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;3.1.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n            &lt;type&gt;jar&lt;/type&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\nhad no effect, I think I still need my old:\r\n\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;javax.ws.rs&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;javax.ws.rs-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;2.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\nIn any case, I&#39;ve ended up in a goose chase of dependency hell (this is a pretty massive and old project), and I&#39;m starting to second guess if my approach is the correct one.\r\n\r\nShould I be importing the &quot;necessary&quot; Javax dependencies right back, next to the Jakarta ones? Is there a simple way to avoid all this pain? The libraries I&#39;m using don&#39;t seem to care about Jakarta, and it&#39;s not really an option to go manually upgrade a bunch of them due to the number of regressions it might cause.\r\n\r\nThe ones on here have been easy to migrate:\r\nhttps://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/transition-from-java-ee-to-jakarta-ee \r\nhttps://foojay.io/today/migrating-from-java-ee-to-jakarta-ee-with-intellij-idea/\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, some dependencies that kinda ship their own, or at least don&#39;t have a Jakarta version just don&#39;t seem to work:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/auth0/auth0-java-mvc-common/issues/97\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I know you guys hate general questions, and I&#39;m bound to get so much negative engagement here, but this is eating me alive. I sadly need general guidance on how to do this. Am I really supposed to (I will probably just give up instead) port these deps, 1 by 1, hope newer versions fix it. And if there isn&#39;t, just do something else. \r\n\r\n\r\nMixing some Javax (namely servlet, ws rs client) and some Jakarta (mail, faces etc.) seems like a bad idea, but it&#39;s the only way I got it to even compile, while during the run time I get errors such as these:\r\n\r\n    13-Apr-2023 08:46:59.789 SEVERE [http-nio-8080-exec-4]

Tomee9 here is relevant because otherwise I'd just be using javaEE libraries with a newer JDK target and call it a day. However, due to class names mismatching (mainly EJB interceptors), I get ClassNotFound exceptions when trying to deploy my WAR.</p>\n<p>My app relies pretty heavily on old JavaEE code. I'm talking Ejb for injects, javax.ws.rs for webclients, javax.servlets, etc. The ejb migration was painless. Just had to swap the namespace and that was it. A few others required a dependency such as jakarta mail.</p>\n<p>So one of the first things I did when trying to migrate, replaced the tomEE javaEE (so javaEE-api) with</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;dependency&gt;\n        &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.tomee&lt;/groupId&gt;\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;jakartaee-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n        &lt;version&gt;10.0-M1&lt;/version&gt;\n        &lt;scope&gt;compile&lt;/scope&gt;\n    &lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This immediately caused issues, which makes sense. Red everywhere due to missing deps. I used the IntelliJ refactor tool, which replaces all Javax namespaces with Jakarta.</p>\n<p>However, that's when I realized plenty of my libraries were still using Javax namespaces. To name a few, Auth0:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;dependency&gt;\n        &lt;groupId&gt;com.auth0&lt;/groupId&gt;\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;mvc-auth-commons&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n        &lt;version&gt;1.9.2&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is relying on Javax servlets and Javax HTTP requests. Adding:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;dependency&gt;\n        &lt;groupId&gt;jakarta.ws.rs&lt;/groupId&gt;\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;jakarta.ws.rs-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n        &lt;version&gt;3.1.0&lt;/version&gt;\n        &lt;type&gt;jar&lt;/type&gt;\n    &lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>had no effect, I think I still need my old:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;dependency&gt;\n        &lt;groupId&gt;javax.ws.rs&lt;/groupId&gt;\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;javax.ws.rs-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n        &lt;version&gt;2.0&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In any case, I've ended up in a goose chase of dependency hell (this is a pretty massive and old project), and I'm starting to second guess if my approach is the correct one.</p>\n<p>Should I be importing the &quot;necessary&quot; Javax dependencies right back, next to the Jakarta ones? Is there a simple way to avoid all this pain? The libraries I'm using don't seem to care about Jakarta, and it's not really an option to go manually upgrade a bunch of them due to the number of regressions it might cause.</p>\n<p>The ones on here have been easy to migrate:\n<a href=\"https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/transition-from-java-ee-to-jakarta-ee\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/transition-from-java-ee-to-jakarta-ee</a>\n<a href=\"https://foojay.io/today/migrating-from-java-ee-to-jakarta-ee-with-intellij-idea/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://foojay.io/today/migrating-from-java-ee-to-jakarta-ee-with-intellij-idea/</a></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, some dependencies that kinda ship their own, or at least don't have a Jakarta version just don't seem to work:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/auth0/auth0-java-mvc-common/issues/97\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/auth0/auth0-java-mvc-common/issues/97</a></p>\n<p>Now I know you guys hate general questions, and I'm bound to get so much negative engagement here, but this is eating me alive. I sadly need general guidance on how to do this. Am I really supposed to (I will probably just give up instead) port these deps, 1 by 1, hope newer versions fix it. And if there isn't, just do something else.</p>\n<p>Mixing some Javax (namely servlet, ws rs client) and some Jakarta (mail, faces etc.) seems like a bad idea, but it's the only way I got it to even compile, while during the run time I get errors such as these:</p>\n<pre><code>13-Apr-2023 08:46:59.789 SEVERE [http-nio-8080-exec-4]
