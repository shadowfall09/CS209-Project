Does anyone know how to resolve this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","dom"],"owner":{"account_id":2562742,"reputation":5917,"user_id":2851311,"display_name":"hfontanez"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1699019918,"creation_date":1699019918,"question_id":77417219,"body_markdown":"I have an XML file similar to this\r\n```\r\n&lt;root&gt;\r\n  &lt;child name=foo&gt;\r\n    &lt;grandchild/&gt;\r\n  &lt;/child&gt;\r\n    &lt;grandchild/&gt;\r\n  &lt;child name=bar&gt;\r\n  &lt;/child&gt;\r\n&lt;/root&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a Java function that looks up a node in this XML and appends it to a new XML file\r\n```\r\npublic void lookup(String attribValue) {\r\n  NodeList nl = null;\r\n  DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\r\n  Document sourceDoc = null;\r\n  try {\r\n    sourceDoc = factory.newDocumentBuilder().parse(new File(&quot;MyXML.xml&quot;));\r\n    XPathFactory xPathFactory = XPathFactory.newInstance();\r\n    XPath xpath = xPathFactory.newXPath();\r\n\r\n    XPathExpression expr = xpath.compile(&quot;//child[@name=&#39;&quot; + attribValue + &quot;&#39;]&quot;);\r\n    nl = (NodeList) expr.evaluate(sourceDoc, XPathConstants.NODESET); \r\n  } catch (Exception e) {\r\n    throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  Node node = nl.items(0);\r\n  if (node.getNodeType() == Node.ELEMENT_NODE) {\r\n    doc.getDocumentElement().appendChild(doc.importNode(node, true));\r\n  } else {\r\n    throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Node is not an element&quot;);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn the code above, `doc` is global variable that represents the target XML.

SERVICES are a common pattern in technical frameworks, but they\r\n&gt; can also apply in the domain layer. The name service emphasizes the\r\n&gt; relationship with other objects. Unlike ENTITIES and VALUE OBJECTS, it\r\n&gt; is defined purely in terms of what it can do for a client. A SERVICE\r\n&gt; tends to be named for an activity, rather than an entity—a verb rather\r\n&gt; than a noun. A SERVICE can still have an abstract, intentional\r\n&gt; definition; it just has a different flavor than the definition of an\r\n&gt; object. A SERVICE should still have a defined responsibility, and that\r\n&gt; responsibility and the interface fulfilling it should be defined as\r\n&gt; part of the domain model. Operation names should come from the\r\n&gt; UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE or be introduced into it. Parameters and results\r\n&gt; should be domain objects. SERVICES should be used judiciously and not\r\n&gt; allowed to strip the ENTITIES and VALUE OBJECTS of all their behavior.\r\n&gt; But when an operation is actually an important domain concept, a\r\n&gt; SERVICE forms a natural part of a MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN. Declared in the\r\n&gt; model as a SERVICE, rather than as a phony object that doesn&#39;t\r\n&gt; actually represent anything, the standalone operation will not mislead\r\n&gt; anyone. \r\n\r\nand a `Repository` as per Eric Evans,\r\n\r\n&gt; A REPOSITORY represents all objects of a certain type as a conceptual\r\n&gt; set (usually emulated). It acts like a collection, except with more\r\n&gt; elaborate querying capability.

This annotation is a\n  general-purpose stereotype and individual teams may narrow their\n  semantics and use as appropriate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you look at domain driven design by eric evans, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A SERVICE is an operation offered as an interface that stands alone in\n  the model, without encapsulating state, as ENTITIES and VALUE OBJECTS\n  do. SERVICES are a common pattern in technical frameworks, but they\n  can also apply in the domain layer. The name service emphasizes the\n  relationship with other objects. Unlike ENTITIES and VALUE OBJECTS, it\n  is defined purely in terms of what it can do for a client. A SERVICE\n  tends to be named for an activity, rather than an entity—a verb rather\n  than a noun. A SERVICE can still have an abstract, intentional\n  definition; it just has a different flavor than the definition of an\n  object. A SERVICE should still have a defined responsibility, and that\n  responsibility and the interface fulfilling it should be defined as\n  part of the domain model. Operation names should come from the\n  UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE or be introduced into it. Parameters and results\n  should be domain objects. SERVICES should be used judiciously and not\n  allowed to strip the ENTITIES and VALUE OBJECTS of all their behavior.\n  But when an operation is actually an important domain concept, a\n  SERVICE forms a natural part of a MODEL-DRIVEN DESIGN. Declared in the\n  model as a SERVICE, rather than as a phony object that doesn't\n  actually represent anything, the standalone operation will not mislead\n  anyone. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and a <code>Repository</code> as per Eric Evans,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A REPOSITORY represents all objects of a certain type as a conceptual\n  set (usually emulated). It acts like a collection, except with more\n  elaborate querying capability. Objects of the appropriate type are\n  added and removed, and the machinery behind the REPOSITORY inserts\n  them or deletes them from the database.

And, to stop the hordes of trolls, yes, I know that technically these annotations are effectively the same thing right now and mostly interchangeable even unto spring 5. Now, for the right answer:\r\n\r\nThese three annotations are completely different things and are not interchangeable. You can tell that because there are three of them rather than just one. They are not intended to be interchangeable, they&#39;re just implemented that way out of elegance and convenience. \r\n\r\nModern programming is invention, art, technique, and communication, in varying proportions. The communication bit is usually very important because code is usually read much more often than its written. As a programmer you&#39;re not only trying to solve the technical problem, you&#39;re also trying to communicate your intent to future programmers who read your code. These programmers may share neither your native language nor your social environment, and it is possible that they may be reading your code 50-years in the future (it&#39;s not as unlikely as you may think). It&#39;s difficult to communicate effectively that far into the future. Therefore, it is vital that we use the clearest, most efficient, correct, and communicative language available to us. We chose our words carefully to have maximum impact and be as clear as possible as to our intent.\r\n\r\nFor example, it is vital that `@Repository` is used when we&#39;re writing a repository, rather than `@Component`. The latter is a very poor choice of annotation for a repository because it does not indicate that we&#39;re looking at a repository. We can assume that a repository is also a spring-bean, but not that a component is a repository. With `@Repository` we are being clear and specific in our language. We are stating clearly that this is a repository. With `@Component` we are leaving it to the reader to decide what type of component they are reading, and they will have to read the whole class (and possibly a tree of subclasses and interfaces) to infer meaning. The class could then possibly be misinterpreted by a reader in the distant future as not being a repository, and we would have been partially responsible for this mistake because we, who knew full well that this is a repository, failed to be specific in our language and communicate our intent effectively.\r\n\r\nI won&#39;t go into the other examples, but will state as clearly as I can: these annotations are completely different things and should be used appropriately, as per their intent. `@Repository` is for storage repositories and no other annotation is correct. `@Service` is for services and no other annotation is correct. `@Controller` is for components that are neither repositories nor services, and to use either of these in its place would also be incorrect. It might compile, it might even run and pass your tests, but it would be wrong and I would think less of you (professionally) if you were to do this.\r\n\r\nThere are examples of this throughout spring (and programming in general). You must not use `@Controller` when writing a REST API, because `@RestController` is available. You must not use `@RequestMapping` when `@GetMapping` is a valid alternative. Etc. Etc. Etc. You *must* choose the most specific exact and correct language you can to communicate your intent to your readers, otherwise, you are introducing risks into your system, and risk has a cost.\r\n\r\nFinally, I&#39;d like to bring up a point of order concerning Object-Oriented systems. One of the fundamental rules is that implementations can vary but interfaces shouldn&#39;t. Assuming that these annotations are the same thing is a very slippery slope and completely against OO. Although they may be implemented in an interchangeable way now, there is no guarantee that they will be in the future. Further, even within the same team, an engineer may decide to hang some behaviour off one or more of these annotations using aspects, or a platform engineer may choose to replace the implementation of one of these for operational reasons.

has a helpful tutorial, [Creating a GUI With Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/index.html).  Skip the Learning Swing with the NetBeans IDE section.  \r\n\r\nI rearranged your code to get the following GUI.\r\n\r\n[![Example][1]][1]\r\n\r\nWhen creating a Swing GUI, you work from the inside out.  You set the size of the various Swing components, and let the `JFrame` size itself by packing the components.\r\n\r\nIf the user wants to maximize the GUI, there&#39;s a rectangle in the upper right for that purpose.  Make your GUI as small as possible.\r\n\r\nGet out of `static` methods.  Method names should be a verb-noun combination.\r\n\r\nGroup like code together.  You had `JFrame` method calls all over your code, making them hard to find.\r\n\r\nCreate a separate method or class for each `JPanel`.  That way, you can easily experiment with different Swing layouts.\r\n\r\nAll Swing applications must start with a call to the `SwingUtilities` `invokeLater` method.  This method ensures that the Swing components are created and executed on the [Event Dispatch Thread](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/dispatch.html).\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the complete runnable code.\r\n\r\n    import java.awt.BorderLayout;\r\n    import java.awt.Color;\r\n    import java.awt.Dimension;\r\n    import java.awt.FlowLayout;\r\n    \r\n    import javax.swing.BorderFactory;\r\n    import javax.swing.BoxLayout;\r\n    import javax.swing.JButton;\r\n    import javax.swing.JFrame;\r\n    import javax.swing.JLabel;\r\n    import javax.swing.JMenu;\r\n    import javax.swing.JMenuBar;\r\n    import javax.swing.JMenuItem;\r\n    import javax.swing.JPanel;\r\n    import javax.swing.SwingUtilities;\r\n    \r\n    public class TextEditor implements Runnable {\r\n    \tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    \t\tSwingUtilities.invokeLater(new TextEditor());\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \t@Override\r\n    \tpublic void run() {\r\n    \t\tJFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;Text Editor&quot;);\r\n    \t\tframe.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\r\n    \t\tframe.setJMenuBar(createMenuBar());\r\n    \r\n    \t\tframe.add(createDrawingPad(), BorderLayout.CENTER);\r\n    \t\tframe.add(createSketchPad(), BorderLayout.EAST);\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tframe.pack();\r\n    \t\tframe.setLocationByPlatform(true);\r\n    \t\tframe.setVisible(true);\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic JMenuBar createMenuBar() {\r\n    \t\tJMenuBar menuBar = new JMenuBar();\r\n    \t\tJMenu file = new JMenu(&quot;File&quot;);\r\n    \t\tString[] fileItems = { &quot;New Tab&quot;, &quot;New Window&quot;, &quot;Open&quot;, &quot;Save&quot;,\r\n    \t\t\t\t&quot;Save As&quot;, &quot;Save All&quot;, &quot;Page Setup&quot;, &quot;Print&quot;, &quot;Close Tab&quot;,\r\n    \t\t\t\t&quot;Close Window&quot;, &quot;Exit&quot;

Implement a custom `Spliterator` that stops yielding elements while a condition is met:\r\n\r\n      ```java\r\n      public class StoppingSpliterator&lt;T&gt; extends Spliterators.AbstractSpliterator&lt;T&gt; {\r\n\r\n          private final Spliterator&lt;T&gt; spliterator;\r\n          private final Supplier&lt;Boolean&gt; stopCondition;\r\n\r\n          public StoppingSpliterator(Spliterator&lt;T&gt; spliterator, Supplier&lt;Boolean&gt; stopCondition) {\r\n              super(spliterator.estimateSize(), 0);\r\n              this.spliterator = spliterator;\r\n              this.stopCondition = stopCondition;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          @Override\r\n          public boolean tryAdvance(Consumer&lt;? super T&gt; action) {\r\n              if (stopCondition.get()) {\r\n                  return false;\r\n              }\r\n              return spliterator.tryAdvance(action);\r\n          }\r\n      }\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n2. Define the limit and the accumulator:\r\n\r\n      ```java\r\n      final int n = 4;\r\n      final AtomicInteger accumulator = new AtomicInteger();\r\n      ```\r\n3. Perform the reduction on the `Stream` wrapped in the `StoppingSpliterator`\r\n\r\n      ```java\r\n      final var result = StreamSupport\r\n              .stream(new StoppingSpliterator&lt;&gt;(\r\n                      authors.spliterator(), \r\n                      () -&gt; accumulator.get() &gt; n), false)\r\n              .reduce(accumulator,\r\n                      (i, author) -&gt; {\r\n                          System.out.println(&quot;Iterating: &quot; + author.getName());\r\n                          i.addAndGet(author.getBooks().size());\r\n                          return i;\r\n                      },\r\n                      (x, y) -&gt; null);\r\n\r\n      // get the result\r\n      System.out.println(result.get() &gt; n);\r\n      ```\r\n\r\nHere are some test data assuming the full-args constructor `(String name, List&lt;String&gt; books)` and getters of the class `Author`.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList&lt;Author&gt; authors = List.of(\r\n    new Author(&quot;Tom&quot;, List.of(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)),\r\n    new Author(&quot;Bob&quot;, List.of()),\r\n    new Author(&quot;Sam&quot;, List.of(&quot;a&quot;)),\r\n    new Author(&quot;Kim&quot;, List.of()),\r\n    new Author(&quot;Tim&quot;, List.of(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;)),\r\n    new Author(&quot;Pim&quot;, List.of(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;)));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe iteration stops when the sum of books is larger than `n`: `4` in our case, so the last iterated author is `Tim` who is an author of a further book so the sum would be 5.
