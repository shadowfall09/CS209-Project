It means that JPA Persistent Context (Hibernate Session) is opened during entire HTTP request. [What is this spring.jpa.open-in-view=true property in Spring Boot?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48222934/3405171)\r\n\r\nIf Persistent Context is opened, `fetch = FetchType.LAZY` property in the code below doesn&#39;t work at all.\r\n```java\r\n@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy = &quot;person&quot;)\r\nprivate List&lt;WeightRecord&gt; weightsList = new ArrayList&lt;WeightRecord&gt;();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you do `personConnected.getWeightsList().conatins()`, Hibernate loads `weightsList` in the background. That&#39;s why the last SQL log entry is logged.\r\n```SQL\r\n    select\r\n        weightslis0_.person_id_person as person_i8_3_0_\r\n    ...\r\n    from\r\n        weight_record weightslis0_ \r\n    where\r\n        weightslis0_.person_id_person=?\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo when you delete a `WeightRecord`, it remains in the `Person.weightsList`, because of it was loaded by `personConnected.getWeightsList().conatins()`.\r\n\r\nWhen HTTP request is completed, Persistent Context becomes closed, and Hibernate flushes all changes to the database. There is `cascade = CascadeType.ALL` on the `Person` side, so Hibernate should keep in mind a deleted `WeightRecord` in the `weightsList`. So it does nothing, because you could delete `WeightRecord` and insert it by some reasons again.\r\n\r\nYou can verify statements above just by removing `personConnected.getWeightsList().conatins()` part of the code, delete will start work.\r\n\r\n**How to solve**\r\n\r\n1. Set `spring.jpa.open-in-view=false` in the `application.property`. So you will have `LazyInitializationException` with `personConnected.getWeightsList().conatins()`\r\n\r\n2. Remove `personConnected.getWeightsList().conatins()` code. You can do the same just comparing `WeightRecord.Person.id` and a current `Person.id`.\r\n```java\r\n        Optional&lt;Person&gt; personConnected = personRepository.findById(appUserConnectedId);\r\n        if (personConnected.isPresent()  ) {\r\n            WeightRecord weightRecordToDelete = weightRecordRepository.findById(weightId).orElseThrow();\r\n            Long userPersonId = personConnected.get().getIdPerson();\r\n            Long recordPersonId = weightRecordToDelete.getPerson().getIdPerson();\r\n            if (Objects.equals(userPersonId, recordPersonId)) {\r\n                logger.info(&quot;SERVICE FOR DELETING&quot;);\r\n                return ResponseEntity.ok(weightRecordServiceImpl.deleteWeightById(weightRecordToDelete));\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        logger.info(&quot;BAD USER FOR BAD WEIGHT&quot;);\r\n        return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can keep `cascade = CascadeType.ALL` on the `weightsList` on `Person` side.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\nAlways use `spring.jpa.open-in-view=false`. `LazyInitializationException` is your friend.\r\n\r\nAlways use `fetch = FetchType.LAZY` on the `@ManyToOne` part of the association. It is `FetchType.EAGER` by default.\r\n```java\r\n\t@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\r\n\tprivate Person person;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNever use Jackson annotations like `@JsonIgnore` and Hibernate Validator annotations like `@Min(1)` with entities.\r\nUse `PersonEntity` class for an entity and `Person` for JSON. Do mapping on the service level.\r\n \r\n","title":"My repository is not called in my service - Spring Data JPA","body":"<p><strong>The reason</strong></p>\n<p>The reason of the issue is this part of the code</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>personConnected.getWeightsList().contains(weightRecordToDelete)\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Why it happens?</strong></p>\n<p>There is a spring data property <code>spring.jpa.open-in-view</code> and it is <code>true</code> by default. It means that JPA Persistent Context (Hibernate Session) is opened during entire HTTP request. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/48222934/3405171\">What is this spring.jpa.open-in-view=true property in Spring Boot?</a></p>\n<p>If Persistent Context is opened, <code>fetch = FetchType.LAZY</code> property in the code below doesn't work at all.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy = &quot;person&quot;)\nprivate List&lt;WeightRecord&gt; weightsList = new ArrayList&lt;WeightRecord&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>When you do <code>personConnected.getWeightsList().conatins()</code>, Hibernate loads <code>weightsList</code> in the background.

There is <code>cascade = CascadeType.ALL</code> on the <code>Person</code> side, so Hibernate should keep in mind a deleted <code>WeightRecord</code> in the <code>weightsList</code>. So it does nothing, because you could delete <code>WeightRecord</code> and insert it by some reasons again.</p>\n<p>You can verify statements above just by removing <code>personConnected.getWeightsList().conatins()</code> part of the code, delete will start work.</p>\n<p><strong>How to solve</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Set <code>spring.jpa.open-in-view=false</code> in the <code>application.property</code>.

Is 2ms realistic?"},{"owner":{"account_id":7413926,"reputation":5474,"user_id":11374957,"display_name":"Kaan"},"score":0,"creation_date":1658464461,"post_id":73074735,"comment_id":129062310,"body_markdown":"Also, go ahead and leave the await(10) in there, and try adding something like this just after that line: `System.out.println(&quot;latch count: &quot; + countDownLatch.getCount())`.

An executor service provides that feature, built-in. \r\n\r\n# `shutdown` &amp; `awaitTermination` in `ExecutorService`\r\n\r\nThe key is making two calls:\r\n\r\n - `ExecutorService#shutdown` to stop the executor service from accepting more task submissions.\r\n - `ExecutorService#awaitTermination` to block and wait for all submitted tasks to finish.\r\n\r\nHere is the main chunk of code excerpted from a full example app posted further down.\r\n\r\nFirst we generate some fake input. And we define a thread-safe list to hold `Result` objects, with each submitted task instantiated and collecting a fresh `Result` object. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nSet &lt; Integer &gt; ids = IntStream.range( 1 , 20_001 ).boxed().collect( Collectors.toSet() );\r\nList &lt; Result &gt; results = Collections.synchronizedList( new ArrayList &lt;&gt;() );\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext we define a collection to hold our pending tasks. We populate with many `Task` objects.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList &lt; Task &gt; tasks = new ArrayList &lt;&gt;( ids.size() );\r\nfor ( Integer id : ids ) tasks.add( new Task( id , results ) );\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe create an executor service with a reasonable number of threads, as appropriate to our deployment machine.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool( 7 );\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext we define a collection to keep all the `Future` objects returned by the executor service when we submit all our tasks.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList &lt; Future &lt; Boolean &gt; &gt; futures = null;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSubmit all the tasks, capturing the futures.\r\n\r\n```java\r\ntry { futures = executorService.invokeAll( tasks , 5 , TimeUnit.MINUTES ); } catch ( InterruptedException e ) { throw new RuntimeException( e ); }\r\n```\r\n\r\n&#128073; Make those two crucial calls in this subroutine, to invoke a shutdown and wait for tasks to complete.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nthis.shutdownAndAwaitTermination( executorService );  // Blocks here, until either (a) executor service completes all assigned tasks, or (b) time-out fires.\r\n```\r\n\r\n&#128273; The key concept is that the code above blocks until all submitted tasks are done… or until the specified time-out fires.\r\n\r\nLastly, we can report on the work.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nthis.report( futures , results );\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Complete code example\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage work.basil.example.parallel;\r\n\r\nimport java.time.Instant;\r\nimport java.util.*;\r\nimport java.util.concurrent.*;\r\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\r\nimport java.util.stream.IntStream;\r\n\r\npublic class App\r\n{\r\n    public static void main ( String[] args )\r\n    {\r\n        App app = new App();\r\n        app.demo();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    record Result( Integer id , UUID label , Instant whenCreated ) { }\r\n\r\n    class Task implements Callable &lt; Boolean &gt;\r\n    {\r\n        private Integer id;\r\n        private List &lt; Result &gt; results;\r\n\r\n        public Task ( Integer id , List &lt; Result &gt; results )\r\n        {\r\n            this.id = id;\r\n            this.results = results;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public Boolean call ( )\r\n        {\r\n            try { Thread.sleep( ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt( 0 , 5 ) ); } catch ( InterruptedException e ) { throw new RuntimeException( e ); }  // Pretend this method takes a while to do its work.\r\n            Result result = new Result( this.id , UUID.randomUUID() , Instant.now() );\r\n            this.results.add( result );\r\n            return Boolean.TRUE;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void demo ( )\r\n    {\r\n        System.out.println( &quot;INFO - Demo starting. &quot; + Instant.now() );\r\n\r\n        Set &lt; Integer &gt; ids = IntStream.range( 1 , 20_001 ).boxed().collect( Collectors.toSet() );\r\n        List &lt; Result &gt; results = Collections.synchronizedList( new ArrayList &lt;&gt;() );\r\n\r\n        List &lt; Task &gt; tasks = new ArrayList &lt;&gt;( ids.size() );\r\n        for ( Integer id : ids ) tasks.add( new Task( id , results ) );\r\n\r\n        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool( 7 );\r\n        List &lt; Future &lt; Boolean &gt; &gt; futures = null;\r\n        try { futures = executorService.invokeAll( tasks , 5 , TimeUnit.MINUTES ); } catch ( InterruptedException e ) { throw new RuntimeException( e ); }\r\n        this.shutdownAndAwaitTermination( executorService );  // Blocks here, until either (a) executor service completes all assigned tasks, or (b) time-out fires.\r\n        this.report( futures , results );\r\n\r\n        System.out.println( &quot;INFO - Demo ending. &quot; + Instant.now() );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void report ( final List &lt; Future &lt; Boolean &gt; &gt; futures , final List &lt; Result &gt; results )\r\n    {\r\n        List &lt; Future &lt; Boolean &gt; &gt; failedFutures =\r\n                futures.stream().filter( future -&gt; {\r\n                            try { return future.isCancelled() || !

You have less control, such as not specifying the number of threads (by default), and less flexibility in the face of failures. But you get drastically shorter simpler code.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefine a record to hold each result. This is similar to above, but here we use  a `String` type for `id` to be closer to your original Question.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nrecord Result( String id , UUID label , Instant whenCreated ) { }\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate some bogus input data, as strings.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList &lt; String &gt; ids =\r\n        IntStream\r\n                .range( 1 , 20_001 )\r\n                .boxed()\r\n                .map( Object :: toString )\r\n                .toUnmodifiableList();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd do the work, all in a single line of code. The `.parallelStream` automatically handles getting a pool of threads of a reasonable size, and then doing the work of instantiating our `Result` object as tasks assigned to the various threads. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nList &lt; Result &gt; results =\r\n        ids\r\n                .parallelStream()\r\n                .map( ( String id ) -&gt; new Result( id , UUID.randomUUID() , Instant.now() ) )\r\n                .toUnmodifiableList();\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly, report results. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nresults.stream().limit( 10 ).forEach( System.out :: println );\r\n```\r\n\r\nBe aware that using parallel streams only makes sense where you have a lengthy workload. For a brief workload, using parallel streams rather than single stream may actually take *more* time, as there is overhead in setting up, managing, and collecting results across threads.  \r\n\r\n# *Project Loom*\r\n\r\nEverything above is relevant for today&#39;s Java. If [*Project Loom*][1] succeeds, and it looks like it will, the rules of the game will be changed… for the better. \r\n\r\nTo learn more, see posts, interviews, and presentations by members of the Loom team such as Ron Pressler and Alan Bateman.

For a `long` that bit is 64-the number of leading zeroes. To get the number of hex digits, one must divide by 4.  To account for numbers evenly divisible by 4, it is necessary to add 3 before dividing.  So that makes the number of digits:\r\n\r\n    `digits = (67-Long.numberOfLeadingZeros(i))&gt;&gt;2`;&lt;br&gt;\r\nwhich then requires it to be adjusted to mask the appropriate parts of the number.\r\n\r\n    `offset = digits-i - 1`\r\n- `m` is the mask to mask off the digit to be removed. So start with a `-1L (all hex &#39;F&#39;)` and right shift `4*(16-offset)` bits. This will result in a mask that masks everything to the right of the digit to be removed.\r\nNote: If `offset` is `0` the shift operator will be `64` and no bits will be shifted.

&quot;Login &amp; Sign-up Form&quot;. The program involve Java Servlet, HTML, CSS which are working fine and JavaScript which i am having problem. I am using JavaScript to validate the username, password and email before submitting them. However, when i click on the &quot;Submit&quot; button, it directly goes to page showing &quot;log @ register success&quot; without checking the three fields. I noticed that the email filed is only checked as it will be done by the browser automatically. Please help me to solve this issue as i do not know what is the problem. Thank you very much. Below is the html code followed by css code. I also add the java servlet code too add below. Your help is much appreciated.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>INDEX.HTML</strong></strong></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n         &lt;meta
