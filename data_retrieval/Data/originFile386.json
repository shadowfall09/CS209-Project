For example if the input is </p>\n\n<pre><code>   String[] input = {\"This\", \"is\", \"This\", \"not\"};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The program should output <code>[T, h, i, s, n, o, t]</code> , the order of elements should follow the same pattern as they appear in input. My approach is to <code>split</code> the input , then <code>map</code>, <code>distinct</code> and finally <code>collect</code> it toList. But the following code is printing list of streams instead of words, what am i missing?.E.g.</p>\n\n<pre><code>String[] input = {\"This\", \"is\", \"This\", \"not\"};\n       System.out.println(Arrays.stream(input)\n               .map(word -&gt; word.split(\"\"))\n               .map(Arrays::stream)\n               .distinct()\n               .collect(toList()));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Current output</p>\n\n<pre><code>[java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline$Head@548c4f57, java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline$Head@1218025c, java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline$Head@816f27d, java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline$Head@87aac27]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am interested to see if there are some other ways in Java8 to achieve the same. </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","openapi","gradle-plugin","swagger-codegen","openapi-generator"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":17193192,"reputation":124,"user_id":12446589,"display_name":"Igor Nosovskyi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1649244664,"creation_date":1649244664,"answer_id":71765971,"question_id":64559945,"body_markdown":"I get the same error.

Utilize the most restrictive access modifier (private whenever possible) to limit access to the necessary parts of your code.\r\n```\r\n    public class MyClass {\r\n        private int privateData;\r\n    \r\n        private void privateMethod() {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Private method&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            MyClass obj = new MyClass();\r\n            obj.privateData = 10; // Accessing private data within the class\r\n            obj.privateMethod(); // Invoking private method within the class\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n - **Immutable Classes**: Design your classes to be immutable.

By configuring a security policy and enabling a Security Manager, you gain control over the permissions granted to your Java application.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    grant {\r\n        permission java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission &quot;suppressAccessChecks&quot;;\r\n    };\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n - **Obfuscation**: Employ obfuscation techniques to make your code harder to understand and reverse-engineer. Obfuscation tools can rename variables, obfuscate control flow, and perform other transformations to diminish code readability.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s important to note that these measures provide challenges but are not foolproof. Determined attackers may find ways to bypass them. Focus on writing secure, well-designed code rather than solely relying on prevention techniques.\r\n\r\nRemember that reflection can be a legitimate and useful tool in specific scenarios, such as testing or dependency injection frameworks.

Plug-in authors can mess with all the things. You accept this. Or use out-of-band systems to ensure they don&#39;t (that&#39;s what e.g. apple&#39;s app store review process is). [B] Write an allow-list model that scans a class file and always rejects them unless that class file only does safe things. Nobody does it this way and you&#39;ll be tempted to work on a denylist model. Don&#39;t. Denylists don&#39;t work and you won&#39;t know it until you get hacked. [C] Run the plug-in in a separate JVM (and sandbox that one, using e.g. chroot stuff on posixen)."},{"owner":{"account_id":401843,"reputation":89863,"user_id":768644,"display_name":"rzwitserloot"},"score":0,"creation_date":1686168509,"post_id":76422157,"comment_id":134763911,"body_markdown":"@AYuan yes, option B and C are __incredibly__ complicated, and C is extremely resource intensive.

If you use different versions of a library in different dependent projects, the classpath loader may pick up the wrong one. This includes having a project dependent on a jar created from an Eclipse project, and having another project dependent on that project and the project which the jar was generated from. The outdated classes in the jar could potentially be loaded instead of the the classes from the project. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>\n\n<p><code>project1</code> depends on <code>project2</code> and <code>project3</code></p>\n\n<p><code>project3</code> depends on <code>project2.jar</code>, a jar generated from the class files in <code>project2</code></p>\n\n<p>A final static field is added to a class in <code>project2</code>, which is recompiled,\nwhile <code>project2.jar</code> is not rebuilt</p>\n\n<p>Running <code>project1</code> may cause the exception, as the classes from <code>project2</code> may be loaded from the project directly OR the jar, which doesn't have the field</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3370948,"reputation":4617,"user_id":2830167,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"ZhaoGang"},"score":2,"creation_date":1547951471,"post_id":51248954,"comment_id":95368872,"body_markdown":"I don&#39;t think it is a java version issue, since it the field is there, any version of the jdk will not lose it.","body":"I don&#39;t think it is a java version issue, since it the field is there, any version of the jdk will not lose it."}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":9954944,"reputation":550,"user_id":7366236,"accept_rate":25,"display_name":"Kejsi Struga"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1531149737,"creation_date":1531149737,"answer_id":51248954,"question_id":6686753,"body_markdown":"It was quite tricky for me, so I am writing my solution. \r\n\r\nI was working in IntelliJ with Boot everything was fine, all Java 8 versions were set up appropriately. \r\n\r\nAfter some hours I somehow checked on terminal the **javac -version** and guess what, it was set to version 9.
