Thanx.","title":"Best practice for fail-safe class loading","body":"<p>In my <a href=\"https://jodd.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jodd library</a> I have a method that loads a class from given class name. Since this method has to be fail-safe (and smart;),  i coded several ways for loading a class in following order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>using current thread classloader:</p>\n<p><code>Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().loadClass(className);</code></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>if above fails, than <code>forName</code> is used:</p>\n<p><code>Class.forName(className);</code></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>if above fails, then classloader of util class is used:</p>\n<p><code>ClassLoaderUtil.class.getClassLoader().loadClass(className);</code></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>and, if a an optional Class argument is given, its classloader is used:</p>\n<p><code>callingClass.getClassLoader().loadClass(className);</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do you think this is a good order and/or should some steps be removed/added?

When I replace x with a new instance of someClass(), does the existing reference value of the object reference variable in the stack change to point to the new object, or is the old reference variable in the stack frame dropped and replaced with a new object reference variable pointing to the new object? Are reference variables mutable? Does this all happen in the same stack frame, or does something else happen?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.ibb.co/108WywS/drawing.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">image</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["java","scala","apache-spark"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":320466,"reputation":8954,"user_id":638764,"display_name":"mazaneicha"},"score":1,"creation_date":1633975641,"post_id":69530446,"comment_id":122897851,"body_markdown":"Why can&#39;t you just add fields to struct one by one, using `StructType.add(StructField)`? https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/org/apache/spark/sql/types/StructType.html#add-org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructField- Or maybe I misunderstood the question.","body":"Why can&#39;t you just add fields to struct one by one, using <code>StructType.add(StructField)</code>? <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/org/apache/spark/sql/types/StructType.html#add-org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructField-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/org/apache/spark/sql/&hellip;</a> Or maybe I misunderstood the question."}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":9154396,"reputation":4513,"user_id":6807769,"display_name":"Vincent Doba"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1633975621,"creation_date":1633975621,"answer_id":69530679,"question_id":69530446,"body_markdown":"Here you don&#39;t need to convert `ArrayList` to Scala `Array`, as `StructType` constructor takes java `StructField[]` array as argument. \r\n\r\nYour code can be changed by setting type when calling `.toArray()` method in your last line of code snippet so it returns a `StructField[]` array instead of an `Object[]` array:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList&lt;StructField&gt; structFieldList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\nfor (String field : fields.values()) {\r\n  StructField sf = DataTypes.createStructField(field, DataTypes.StringType, true);\r\n  structFieldList.add(sf);\r\n}\r\nStructType structType = new StructType(structFieldList.toArray(new StructField[0]));\r\n```","title":"How to convert ArrayList into Scala Array in Spark","body":"<p>Here you don't need to convert <code>ArrayList</code> to Scala <code>Array</code>, as <code>StructType</code> constructor takes java <code>StructField[]</code> array as argument.</p>\n<p>Your code can be changed by setting type when calling <code>.toArray()</code> method in your last line of code snippet so it returns a <code>StructField[]</code> array instead of an <code>Object[]</code> array:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>List&lt;StructField&gt; structFieldList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\nfor (String field : fields.values()) {\n  StructField sf = DataTypes.createStructField(field, DataTypes.StringType, true);\n  structFieldList.add(sf);\n}\nStructType structType = new StructType(structFieldList.toArray(new StructField[0]));\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":23005361,"reputation":11,"user_id":17128734,"display_name":"ddddff3f33_gieor"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":415,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1634019606,"creation_date":1633974275,"question_id":69530446,"body_markdown":"I want to create a StructType dynamically out of a json file.
