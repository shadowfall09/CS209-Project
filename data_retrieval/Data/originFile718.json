The large integer does not contain any leading 0&#39;s.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **Example 1**\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; * Input: `digits = [1,2,3]`\r\n&gt; * Output: `[1,2,4]`\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;     Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.  \r\n&gt;     Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.  \r\n&gt;     Thus, the result should be `[1,2,4]`.  \r\n\r\nMy solution is:  \r\n\r\n    class Solution {  \r\n        public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {  \r\n            int num = 0;  \r\n            for (int a : digits) {  \r\n                num = 10*num + a;  \r\n            }  \r\n            int n=num+1;  \r\n            String str=String.valueOf(n);  \r\n            int arr[]=new int[str.length()];  \r\n            for(int i=0;i&lt;str.length();i++){  \r\n                arr[i]=str.charAt(i)-&#39;0&#39;;  \r\n            }  \r\n            return arr;  \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nI am getting many test cases failed, one being:\r\n\r\n    Input:\r\n    [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0]  \r\n    Output:\r\n    [1,2,8,6,6,0,8,6,1,9]  \r\n    Expected:\r\n    [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,1]  \r\n\r\nCan anyone help me with it?","title":"Plus one leetcode","body":"<p>I am doing a question on leetcode, <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">66.
