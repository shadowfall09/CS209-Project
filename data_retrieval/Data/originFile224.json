You appear to want to create somewhat list of items held in a JScrollPane, that scrolls correctly and shows correctly, but the main JPanel that is held by the JScrollPane and that holds all the listing sub-components uses FlowLayout, a *very* limited layout manager, one that is useful mainly for very simple linear based layouts. For this situation, one possible solution is to have the main JPanel that is held by the scrollpane use a BoxLayout oriented to the page-axis. This way, components added will be added below previously added components. This way, using a BoxLayout, the JScrollPane will *automatically* size its viewport correctly, without you having to use any `getHeight()` kludges, a *brittle* kludge, as you are finding out.\r\n\r\nFor example, my [MRE](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) program:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport java.awt.BorderLayout;\r\nimport java.awt.Color;\r\nimport java.awt.Dimension;\r\nimport java.awt.Font;\r\nimport javax.swing.BorderFactory;\r\nimport javax.swing.BoxLayout;\r\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\r\nimport javax.swing.JLabel;\r\nimport javax.swing.JPanel;\r\nimport javax.swing.JScrollPane;\r\nimport javax.swing.JTextArea;\r\nimport javax.swing.SwingConstants;\r\nimport javax.swing.SwingUtilities;\r\n\r\n@SuppressWarnings(&quot;serial&quot;)\r\npublic class UserInterface2 extends JPanel {\r\n\r\n    private static final int PREF_W = 1600;\r\n    private static final int PREF_H = 900;\r\n    JPanel mainPanel = new JPanel();\r\n\r\n    public UserInterface2() {\r\n        setLayout(new BorderLayout());\r\n        setBackground(new Color(100, 100, 100));\r\n        \r\n        JPanel sidePanel = new JPanel();\r\n        sidePanel.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(500, 100));\r\n        sidePanel.setBackground(new Color(220, 228, 232));\r\n        add(sidePanel, BorderLayout.WEST);\r\n        \r\n        JPanel topPanel = new JPanel();\r\n        topPanel.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(1000, 50));\r\n        topPanel.setBackground(new Color(230, 230, 230));\r\n\r\n        JPanel rightPanel = new JPanel(new BorderLayout(5, 5));\r\n        rightPanel.setBackground(new Color(150, 150, 150));\r\n        rightPanel.add(topPanel, BorderLayout.NORTH);\r\n        \r\n        mainPanel.setLayout(new BoxLayout(mainPanel, BoxLayout.PAGE_AXIS));\r\n        mainPanel.setBackground(new Color(230, 230, 230));\r\n        JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(mainPanel);\r\n        rightPanel.add(scrollPane);\r\n        \r\n        add(rightPanel);\r\n        \r\n        int maxI = 30;\r\n        for (int i = 0;

In the future, please consider extracting from your code a decent minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example), a small compilable and runnable program, one without too much extraneous code that is unrelated to your problem and not required for the code to compile and run, one that is without need of outside resources that we do not have access to, such as other classes, images (unless your code gets them from an online URL), and database, and posting this code with your question. This will allow us to more easily test your code ourselves, and hopefully modify it so that we can find fixable problems. Note that we do not want to see your entire program, nor a link to a code repository. Instead keep it small, keep it simple, and make it functioning.

Just because this is a Swing GUI doesn&#39;t mean that you should throw out the OOPs baby with the bath water, and in fact it is even more important to use good OOP techniques in GUI programs, which tend to be more complex, if only to help keep bugs due to the cyclomatic complexity at bay.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tthtf.png","title":"JPanel.getHeight() doesn&#39;t exactly work as intended","body":"<p>Your question appears to be an <a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem\">XY Problem</a> where you ask how to solve a specific code problem when the best solution is to use a completely different approach.</p>\n<p>Your question is &quot;why isn't <code>getHeight()</code> working like I want it to work&quot;, when the real issue is that you're using the wrong layout managers. You appear to want to create somewhat list of items held in a JScrollPane, that scrolls correctly and shows correctly, but the main JPanel that is held by the JScrollPane and that holds all the listing sub-components uses FlowLayout, a <em>very</em> limited layout manager, one that is useful mainly for very simple linear based layouts. For this situation, one possible solution is to have the main JPanel that is held by the scrollpane use a BoxLayout oriented to the page-axis. This way, components added will be added below previously added components. This way, using a BoxLayout, the JScrollPane will <em>automatically</em> size its viewport correctly, without you having to use any <code>getHeight()</code> kludges, a <em>brittle</em> kludge, as you are finding out.</p>\n<p>For example, my <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example\">MRE</a> program:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tthtf.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tthtf.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<pre><code>import java.awt.BorderLayout;\nimport java.awt.Color;\nimport java.awt.Dimension;\nimport java.awt.Font;\nimport javax.swing.BorderFactory;\nimport javax.swing.BoxLayout;\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\nimport javax.swing.JLabel;\nimport javax.swing.JPanel;\nimport javax.swing.JScrollPane;\nimport javax.swing.JTextArea;\nimport javax.swing.SwingConstants;\nimport javax.swing.SwingUtilities;\n\n@SuppressWarnings(&quot;serial&quot;)\npublic class UserInterface2 extends JPanel {\n\n    private static final int PREF_W = 1600;\n    private static final int PREF_H = 900;\n    JPanel mainPanel = new JPanel();\n\n    public UserInterface2() {\n        setLayout(new BorderLayout());\n        setBackground(new Color(100, 100, 100));\n        \n        JPanel sidePanel = new JPanel();\n        sidePanel.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(500, 100));\n        sidePanel.setBackground(new Color(220, 228, 232));\n        add(sidePanel, BorderLayout.WEST);\n        \n        JPanel topPanel = new JPanel();\n        topPanel.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(1000, 50));\n        topPanel.setBackground(new Color(230, 230, 230));\n\n        JPanel rightPanel = new JPanel(new BorderLayout(5, 5));\n        rightPanel.setBackground(new Color(150, 150, 150));\n        rightPanel.add(topPanel, BorderLayout.NORTH);\n        \n        mainPanel.setLayout(new BoxLayout(mainPanel, BoxLayout.PAGE_AXIS));\n        mainPanel.setBackground(new Color(230, 230, 230));\n        JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(mainPanel);\n        rightPanel.add(scrollPane);\n        \n        add(rightPanel);\n        \n        int maxI = 30;\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; maxI; i++) {\n            mainPanel.add(createFlowPanel(i));\n        }\n    }\n\n    private JPanel createFlowPanel(int i) {\n        // panel to hold each cell\n        JPanel flowPanel = new JPanel();\n        flowPanel.setLayout(new BorderLayout());\n        flowPanel.setBackground(new Color(220, 220, 220));\n        \n        // add a white border around the panel to separate cells\n        int ebGap = 14;\n        flowPanel.setBorder(BorderFactory.createLineBorder(Color.WHITE, ebGap));\n        JLabel titleLabel = new JLabel(&quot;&quot;, SwingConstants.LEADING);\n        titleLabel.setFont(new Font(&quot;Arial&quot;, Font.BOLD, 25));\n        // titleLabel.setText(tempObject.get(&quot;name&quot;).toString());\n        titleLabel.setText(&quot;name &quot; + i); // !!\n        flowPanel.add(titleLabel, BorderLayout.PAGE_START);\n        JTextArea valueLabel = new JTextArea();\n        valueLabel.setFont(new Font(&quot;Arial&quot;, Font.PLAIN, 15));\n        valueLabel.setBackground(new Color(220, 220, 220));\n        valueLabel.setLineWrap(true);\n        valueLabel.setWrapStyleWord(true);\n        valueLabel.setEditable(false);\n        \n        // create a bunch of random text of random lengths\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3 + (int) 3 * Math.random(); j++) {\n            for (int k = 0; k &lt; 10 + (int) 20 * Math.random(); k++) {\n                for (int l = 0; l &lt; 4 + (int)8 * Math.random(); l++) {\n                    char myChar = (char)('a' + (int) ('z' - 'a' + 1) * Math.random());\n                    sb.append(myChar);\n                }\n                sb.append(&quot; &quot;);\n            }\n            sb.append(System.lineSeparator());            \n        }\n        valueLabel.setText(sb.toString());\n        flowPanel.add(valueLabel);\n        return flowPanel;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Dimension getPreferredSize() {\n        Dimension superSize = super.getPreferredSize();\n        int w = Math.max(superSize.width, PREF_W);\n        int h = Math.min(superSize.height, PREF_H);\n        return new Dimension(w, h);\n    }\n    \n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -&gt; {\n            UserInterface2 ui2 = new UserInterface2();\n\n            JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;ClippyBoards&quot;);\n            frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n            frame.add(ui2);\n            frame.pack();\n            frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\n            frame.setVisible(true);\n        });\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<p>Note also that your code has dependencies that we cannot access, making the code uncompilable, unrunnable and untestable for us.

up:\r\n\r\n    public TabHighlight()\r\n    {\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; MAX; i++)\r\n        {\r\n           Color color     = Color.black;   //Set default tab background to black\r\n           Color color2    = Color.white;   //Set default tab foreground to white\r\n           \r\n           pane.add(&quot;Tab &quot; + String.valueOf(i), new TabContent(pane, i, color));\r\n                \r\n           pane.setBackgroundAt(i, color);\r\n           pane.setForegroundAt(i, Color.white);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        this.add(pane);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe first area that you are requesting help with your in program is in the &quot;for&quot; block. I will try to explain this in a way that you will understand.\r\n\r\nThe first two lines define the default background and foreground color for each inactive tab. You can change these to a color of your preference.\r\n\r\nThe third line adds a tab with the following attributes:\r\n\r\n 1. A string defining the text that will be displayed on the tab\r\n 2. A tab number, you don&#39;t have to include this if you don&#39;t want to\r\n 3. Creates the second snippet of code which I will get to after this one\r\n\r\nThe fourth line applies the default background color\r\n\r\nThe final line applies the default foreground color. NOTE: these attributes cannot be changed with `UIManager`. I have tried a few alternative approaches but was unsuccessful. Darn, I wish there was an easier way to achieve this.\r\n\r\nNow let&#39;s take a closer look at this snippit of code that defines the appearance of active and inactive tabs:\r\n\r\n        private TabContent(JTabbedPane panel, int i, Color color)\r\n        {\r\n            //Active and inactive tab coloring must be done\r\n            //when rendering the CONTENT of the JTabbedPane object\r\n                    \r\n            //Override these default settings to allow for active and inactive\r\n            //tab background color changing\r\n                    \r\n            panel.setUI(new BasicTabbedPaneUI()\r\n            {\r\n                @Override\r\n                protected void installDefaults()\r\n                {\r\n                    super.installDefaults();\r\n        \r\n                    highlight       = Color.lightGray;\r\n                    lightHighlight  = Color.white;\r\n        \r\n                    shadow          = Color.gray;\r\n                    darkShadow      = Color.darkGray;\r\n        \r\n                    //Active tab background is white\r\n                    //so set the focus color to white\r\n                    //to hide the active tab focus\r\n                    //marker seeing that we want the\r\n                    //active tab backgound to be different\r\n                    focus           = Color.black;\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        \r\n            //Set the active tab background to white\r\n            UIManager.put(&quot;TabbedPane.selected&quot;, Color.gray);\r\n            \r\n            //Set the inactive tab background to black\r\n            UIManager.put(&quot;TabbedPane.unselectedTabBackground&quot;, Color.black);\r\n        \r\n            //Remove borders\r\n            UIManager.put(&quot;TabbedPane.contentBorderInsets&quot;\r\n                          , new Insets(0, 0, 0, 0));\r\n        \r\n            setOpaque(true);\r\n                    \r\n            setBackground(color);\r\n            setForeground(Color.white);\r\n                    \r\n            add(new JLabel(&quot;Tab content &quot; + String.valueOf(i)));\r\n        }\r\n\r\nIn this part of the code, do the following:\r\n\r\n 1. Override the UI by using this block of code below\r\n     \r\n     `panel.setUI(new BasicTabbedPaneUI()\r\n     {\r\n          //place the code from step 2 here\r\n     }`\r\n\r\n 2. Enter these properties of that section:\r\n\r\n    `highlight      = Color.lightGray;\r\n    lightHighlight  = Color.white;\r\n    shadow          = Color.gray;\r\n    darkShadow      = Color.darkGray;\r\n    focus           = Color.black;`\r\n    \r\n    Just like in the first snippet, you change these attributes as well. Here is a little\r\n    tip: each tab has a little dotted box around the tab label, this marks the focus. If\r\n    you want to hide this marker, simply set its color to match that of the active tab, \r\n    which now has the focus.\r\n\r\n 3. Use the `UIManager` to change the following attributes:\r\n    `UIManager.put(&quot;TabbedPane.selected&quot;, Color.gray);\r\n    UIManager.put(&quot;TabbedPane.unselectedTabBackground&quot;, Color.black);`\r\n    \r\n    This will allow you change active *and* inactive tab backgrounds during program\r\n    runtime.\r\n\r\n    You were using the `UIManager` which is the best way to achieve what you were trying   \r\n    to do. Using this bit of code here allows you to make the changes that you looking\r\n    for, but you have do step 2 before any of these changes will be able to take\r\n    effect. `UIManager.put(&quot;TabbedPane.selectedForeground&quot;, Color.xxx)` and\r\n    `UIManager.put(&quot;TabbedPane.unselectedTabForeground&quot;, Color.xxx)` don&#39;t change the\r\n    foreground color, the foreground color stays the same.\r\n    `UIManager.put(&quot;TabbedPane.selected&quot;, Color.xxx)` *will* change the background color\r\n    of the active tab and `UIManager.put(&quot;TabbedPane.unselectedTabBackground&quot;)` will\r\n    change the background color of *inactive* tab.\r\n\r\nCopy and paste these two snippets of code in to your file and change them as you need.\r\n\r\nI would recommend that you copy the whole source code at the top and paste it into compiler and then run it first. This way you will be able see what this program does and when you go back to your original code that you are working with, you will know where to place these snippets of code.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\nIf you are having trouble with this, post an SSCCE in your response so I can see where you are having trouble.\r\n\r\nThanks.","title":"change active tab color in JTabbedPane","body":"<p>Try this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.awt.*;\nimport javax.swing.*;\nimport javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicTabbedPaneUI;\n\npublic class TabHighlight extends JPanel\n{\n    private static final int MAX = 5;\n    private JTabbedPane pane = new JTabbedPane();\n\n    public TabHighlight()\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; MAX; i++)\n        {\n            Color color     = Color.black;   //Set default tab background to black\n            pane.add(\"Tab \" + String.valueOf(i), new TabContent(pane, i, color));\n\n            pane.setBackgroundAt(i, color);\n            pane.setForegroundAt(i, Color.white);\n        }\n\n        this.add(pane);\n    }\n\n    private static class TabContent extends JPanel\n    {\n        private TabContent(JTabbedPane panel, int i, Color color)\n        {\n            //Active and inactive tab coloring must be done\n            //when rendering the CONTENT of the JTabbedPane object\n\n            //Override these default settings to allow for active and inactive\n            //tab background color changing\n\n            panel.setUI(new BasicTabbedPaneUI()\n            {\n                @Override\n                protected void installDefaults()\n                {\n                    super.installDefaults();\n\n                    highlight       = Color.lightGray;\n                    lightHighlight  = Color.white;\n\n                    shadow          = Color.gray;\n                    darkShadow      = Color.darkGray;\n\n                    //Active tab background is white\n                    //so set the focus color to white\n                    //to hide the active tab focus\n                    //marker seeing that we want the\n                    //active tab backgound to be different\n                    focus           = Color.black;\n                }\n            });\n\n            //Set the active tab background to white\n            UIManager.put(\"TabbedPane.selected\", Color.gray);\n\n            UIManager.put(\"TabbedPane.unselectedTabBackground\", Color.black);\n\n            //Remove borders\n            UIManager.put(\"TabbedPane.contentBorderInsets\", new Insets(0, 0, 0, 0));\n\n            setOpaque(true);\n\n            setBackground(color);\n            setForeground(Color.white);\n\n            add(new JLabel(\"Tab content \" + String.valueOf(i)));\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public Dimension getPreferredSize()\n        {\n            return new Dimension(320, 240);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void display()\n    {\n        JFrame f = new JFrame(\"TabHighlight\");\n        f.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n        f.add(this);\n        f.pack();\n        f.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\n        f.setVisible(true);\n    }\n\n    //Use this function here to change the look and feel to Java's default\n    //If using a mac with OS X Yosemite or another recent Mac OS X release\n    public static void initLookAndFeel()\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            UIManager.setLookAndFeel(\n              UIManager.getCrossPlatformLookAndFeelClassName()\n              );\n        } \n        catch(UnsupportedLookAndFeelException e)\n        {\n\n        }\n        catch(ClassNotFoundException e)\n        {\n\n        }\n        catch(InstantiationException e)\n        {\n\n        }\n        catch(IllegalAccessException e)\n        {\n\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args)\n    {\n        EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable()\n            {\n                @Override\n                public void run()\n                {\n                    initLookAndFeel();\n                    new TabHighlight().display();\n                }\n            });\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let's take take a look at this snippet of code that adds 5 tabs a program start up:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public TabHighlight()\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; MAX; i++)\n    {\n       Color color     = Color.black;   //Set default tab background to black\n       Color color2    = Color.white;   //Set default tab foreground to white\n\n       pane.add(\"Tab \" + String.valueOf(i), new TabContent(pane, i, color));\n\n       pane.setBackgroundAt(i, color);\n       pane.setForegroundAt(i, Color.white);\n    }\n\n    this.add(pane);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first area that you are requesting help with your in program is in the \"for\" block.

To determine methods that optimized results with minimal morbidity, the authors examined their results and complications based on reconstruction method and timing. METHODS: The authors reviewed all breast reconstructions after mastectomy for breast cancer performed under the supervision of a single surgeon over a 6-year period at a tertiary referral center. Reconstruction method and timing, patient characteristics, and complication rates were reviewed. RESULTS: Reconstruction was performed on 240 consecutive women (94 bilateral and 146 unilateral; 334 total reconstructions). Reconstruction timing was evenly split between immediate (n = 167) and delayed (n = 167). Autologous tissue (n = 192) was more common than tissue expander/implant reconstruction (n = 142), and the free deep inferior epigastric perforator was the most common free flap (n = 124). The authors found no difference in the complication incidence with autologous reconstruction, whether performed immediately or delayed. However, there was a significantly higher complication rate following immediate placement of a tissue expander when compared with delayed reconstruction (p = 0.008). Capsular contracture was a significantly more common late complication following immediate (40.4 percent) versus delayed (17.0 percent) reconstruction (p &amp;lt; 0.001; odds ratio, 5.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 11.6). CONCLUSIONS: Autologous reconstruction can be performed immediately or delayed, with optimal aesthetic outcome and low flap loss risk. However, the overall complication and capsular contracture incidence following immediate tissue expander/implant reconstruction was much higher than when performed delayed. Thus, tissue expander placement at the time of mastectomy may not necessarily save the patient an extra operation and may compromise the final aesthetic outcome.&lt;/Abstract&gt;\r\n    &lt;BookTitle&gt;Book1&lt;/BookTitle&gt;\r\n    &lt;Publisher&gt;Publisher01, Boston&lt;/Publisher&gt;\r\n    &lt;Edition&gt;1st&lt;/Edition&gt;\r\n    &lt;EditorList&gt;\r\n\t&lt;Editor&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;LastName&gt;Lewis&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ForeName&gt;Philip M&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;Initials&gt;PM&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/Editor&gt;\r\n\t&lt;Editor&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;LastName&gt;Kiffer&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ForeName&gt;Michael&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;Initials&gt;M&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/Editor&gt;\r\n    &lt;/EditorList&gt;\r\n    &lt;Page&gt;19-28&lt;/Page&gt;\r\n    &lt;Year&gt;2008&lt;/Year&gt;\r\n    &lt;AuthorList&gt;\r\n                &lt;Author ValidYN=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;LastName&gt;Sullivan&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;ForeName&gt;Stephen R&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Initials&gt;SR&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Author&gt;\r\n                &lt;Author ValidYN=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;LastName&gt;Fletcher&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;ForeName&gt;Derek R D&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Initials&gt;DR&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Author&gt;\r\n                &lt;Author ValidYN=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;LastName&gt;Isom&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;ForeName&gt;Casey D&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Initials&gt;CD&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Author&gt;\r\n                &lt;Author ValidYN=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;LastName&gt;Isik&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;ForeName&gt;F Frank&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Initials&gt;FF&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Author&gt;\r\n    &lt;/AuthorList&gt;\r\n    //\r\n    &lt;PaperTitle&gt;Polygenes, risk prediction, and targeted prevention of breast cancer.&lt;/PaperTitle&gt;\r\n    &lt;Abstract&gt;BACKGROUND: New developments in the search for susceptibility alleles in complex disorders provide support for the possibility of a polygenic approach to the prevention and treatment of common diseases. METHODS: We examined the implications, both for individualized disease prevention and for public health policy, of findings concerning the risk of breast cancer that are based on common genetic variation. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that the risk profile generated by the known, common, moderate-risk alleles does not provide sufficient discrimination to warrant individualized prevention. However, useful risk stratification may be possible in the context of programs for disease prevention in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical use of single, common, low-penetrance genes is limited, but a few susceptibility alleles may distinguish women who are at high risk for breast cancer from those who are at low risk, particularly in the context of population screening.&lt;/Abstract&gt;\r\n    &lt;BookTitle&gt;Book2&lt;/BookTitle&gt;\r\n    &lt;Publisher&gt;Publisher02, New York&lt;/Publisher&gt;\r\n    &lt;Edition&gt;3rd&lt;/Edition&gt;\r\n    &lt;EditorList&gt;\r\n\t&lt;Editor&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;LastName&gt;Bernstein&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ForeName&gt;Arthur&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;Initials&gt;A&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/Editor&gt;\r\n    &lt;/EditorList&gt;\r\n    &lt;Page&gt;2796-803&lt;/Page&gt;\r\n    &lt;Year&gt;2008&lt;/Year&gt;\r\n    &lt;AuthorList&gt;\r\n                &lt;Author ValidYN=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;LastName&gt;Pharoah&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;ForeName&gt;Paul D P&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Initials&gt;PD&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Author&gt;\r\n                &lt;Author ValidYN=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;LastName&gt;Antoniou&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;ForeName&gt;Antonis C&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Initials&gt;AC&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Author&gt;\r\n                &lt;Author ValidYN=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;LastName&gt;Easton&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;ForeName&gt;Douglas F&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Initials&gt;DF&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Author&gt;\r\n                &lt;Author ValidYN=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;LastName&gt;Ponder&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;ForeName&gt;Bruce A J&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Initials&gt;BA&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Author&gt;\r\n    &lt;/AuthorList&gt;\r\n    //\r\n    &lt;PaperTitle&gt;Invasive breast cancer: predicting disease recurrence by using high-spatial-resolution signal enhancement ratio imaging.&lt;/PaperTitle&gt;\r\n    &lt;Abstract&gt;PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate high-spatial-resolution signal enhancement ratio (SER) imaging for the prediction of disease recurrence in patients with breast cancer who underwent preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant; informed consent was waived. From 1995 to 2002, gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging data were acquired with a three time point high-resolution method in women undergoing neoadjuvant therapy for invasive breast cancers. Forty-eight women (mean age, 49.1 years; range, 29.7-72.4 years) were divided into recurrence-free or recurrence groups. Volume measurements were tabulated for SER values between set ranges; cutoff criteria were defined to predict disease recurrence after surgery. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model were used for evaluation. RESULTS: Breast tumor volume calculated from the number of voxels with SER values above a threshold corresponding to the upper limit of mean redistribution rate constant in benign tumors (0.88 minutes(-1)) and the volume of cancerous breast tissue infiltrating into the parenchyma were important predictors of disease recurrence. Seventy-five percent of patients with recurrence and 100% of deceased patients were identified as being at high risk for recurrence. Thirty percent of patients with recurrence and 67% of deceased patients were identified as having high risk before chemotherapy. No patients in the recurrence-free group were misidentified as likely to have recurrence. All three prechemotherapy parameters (total tumor volume, tumor volumes with high and low SER) and the postchemotherapy tumor volume with high SER were significantly different between the two groups. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression showed that, of the three prechemotherapy covariates, only the low SER and high SER tumor volumes (P = .017 and .049, respectively) were significant and independent predictors of tumor recurrence. Tumor volume with high SER was the only significant postchemotherapy covariate predictor (P = .038). CONCLUSION: High-spatial-resolution SER imaging may improve prediction for patients at high risk for disease recurrence and death.&lt;/Abstract&gt;\r\n    &lt;BookTitle&gt;Book3&lt;/BookTitle&gt;\r\n    &lt;Publisher&gt;Publisher03, London&lt;/Publisher&gt;\r\n    &lt;Edition&gt;3rd&lt;/Edition&gt;\r\n    &lt;EditorList&gt;\r\n\t&lt;Editor&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;LastName&gt;Anderson&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ForeName&gt;John T&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;Initials&gt;JT&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/Editor&gt;\r\n\t&lt;Editor&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;LastName&gt;Hoffman&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ForeName&gt;John A&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;Initials&gt;JA&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/Editor&gt;\r\n\t&lt;Editor&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;LastName&gt;Smithson&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;ForeName&gt;Joshua H&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;Initials&gt;JH&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/Editor&gt;\r\n    &lt;/EditorList&gt;\r\n    &lt;Page&gt;79-87&lt;/Page&gt;\r\n    &lt;Year&gt;2008&lt;/Year&gt;\r\n    &lt;AuthorList&gt;\r\n                &lt;Author ValidYN=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;LastName&gt;Li&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;ForeName&gt;Ka-Loh&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Initials&gt;KL&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Author&gt;\r\n                &lt;Author ValidYN=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;LastName&gt;Partridge&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;ForeName&gt;Savannah C&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Initials&gt;SC&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Author&gt;\r\n                &lt;Author ValidYN=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;LastName&gt;Joe&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;ForeName&gt;Bonnie N&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Initials&gt;BN&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Author&gt;\r\n                &lt;Author ValidYN=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;LastName&gt;Gibbs&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;ForeName&gt;Jessica E&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Initials&gt;JE&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Author&gt;\r\n                &lt;Author ValidYN=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;LastName&gt;Lu&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;ForeName&gt;Ying&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Initials&gt;Y&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Author&gt;\r\n                &lt;Author ValidYN=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;LastName&gt;Esserman&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;ForeName&gt;Laura J&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Initials&gt;LJ&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Author&gt;\r\n                &lt;Author ValidYN=&quot;Y&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;LastName&gt;Hylton&lt;/LastName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;ForeName&gt;Nola M&lt;/ForeName&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Initials&gt;NM&lt;/Initials&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Author&gt;\r\n    &lt;/AuthorList&gt;\r\n    //","title":"Java Pattern Matcher returns null after working perfect with nine previous similar pattern/matches","body":"<p>This class opens a file, delimitates at <code>//</code> and returns a string.

To determine methods that optimized results with minimal morbidity, the authors examined their results and complications based on reconstruction method and timing. METHODS: The authors reviewed all breast reconstructions after mastectomy for breast cancer performed under the supervision of a single surgeon over a 6-year period at a tertiary referral center. Reconstruction method and timing, patient characteristics, and complication rates were reviewed. RESULTS: Reconstruction was performed on 240 consecutive women (94 bilateral and 146 unilateral; 334 total reconstructions). Reconstruction timing was evenly split between immediate (n = 167) and delayed (n = 167). Autologous tissue (n = 192) was more common than tissue expander/implant reconstruction (n = 142), and the free deep inferior epigastric perforator was the most common free flap (n = 124). The authors found no difference in the complication incidence with autologous reconstruction, whether performed immediately or delayed. However, there was a significantly higher complication rate following immediate placement of a tissue expander when compared with delayed reconstruction (p = 0.008). Capsular contracture was a significantly more common late complication following immediate (40.4 percent) versus delayed (17.0 percent) reconstruction (p &amp;lt; 0.001; odds ratio, 5.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 11.6). CONCLUSIONS: Autologous reconstruction can be performed immediately or delayed, with optimal aesthetic outcome and low flap loss risk. However, the overall complication and capsular contracture incidence following immediate tissue expander/implant reconstruction was much higher than when performed delayed. Thus, tissue expander placement at the time of mastectomy may not necessarily save the patient an extra operation and may compromise the final aesthetic outcome.&lt;/Abstract&gt;\n&lt;BookTitle&gt;Book1&lt;/BookTitle&gt;\n&lt;Publisher&gt;Publisher01, Boston&lt;/Publisher&gt;\n&lt;Edition&gt;1st&lt;/Edition&gt;\n&lt;EditorList&gt;\n&lt;Editor&gt;\n    &lt;LastName&gt;Lewis&lt;/LastName&gt;\n    &lt;ForeName&gt;Philip M&lt;/ForeName&gt;\n    &lt;Initials&gt;PM&lt;/Initials&gt;\n&lt;/Editor&gt;\n&lt;Editor&gt;\n    &lt;LastName&gt;Kiffer&lt;/LastName&gt;\n    &lt;ForeName&gt;Michael&lt;/ForeName&gt;\n    &lt;Initials&gt;M&lt;/Initials&gt;\n&lt;/Editor&gt;\n&lt;/EditorList&gt;\n&lt;Page&gt;19-28&lt;/Page&gt;\n&lt;Year&gt;2008&lt;/Year&gt;\n&lt;AuthorList&gt;\n            &lt;Author ValidYN=\"Y\"&gt;\n                &lt;LastName&gt;Sullivan&lt;/LastName&gt;\n                &lt;ForeName&gt;Stephen R&lt;/ForeName&gt;\n                &lt;Initials&gt;SR&lt;/Initials&gt;\n            &lt;/Author&gt;\n            &lt;Author ValidYN=\"Y\"&gt;\n                &lt;LastName&gt;Fletcher&lt;/LastName&gt;\n                &lt;ForeName&gt;Derek R D&lt;/ForeName&gt;\n                &lt;Initials&gt;DR&lt;/Initials&gt;\n            &lt;/Author&gt;\n            &lt;Author ValidYN=\"Y\"&gt;\n                &lt;LastName&gt;Isom&lt;/LastName&gt;\n                &lt;ForeName&gt;Casey D&lt;/ForeName&gt;\n                &lt;Initials&gt;CD&lt;/Initials&gt;\n            &lt;/Author&gt;\n            &lt;Author ValidYN=\"Y\"&gt;\n                &lt;LastName&gt;Isik&lt;/LastName&gt;\n                &lt;ForeName&gt;F Frank&lt;/ForeName&gt;\n                &lt;Initials&gt;FF&lt;/Initials&gt;\n            &lt;/Author&gt;\n&lt;/AuthorList&gt;\n//\n&lt;PaperTitle&gt;Polygenes, risk prediction, and targeted prevention of breast cancer.&lt;/PaperTitle&gt;\n&lt;Abstract&gt;BACKGROUND: New developments in the search for susceptibility alleles in complex disorders provide support for the possibility of a polygenic approach to the prevention and treatment of common diseases. METHODS: We examined the implications, both for individualized disease prevention and for public health policy, of findings concerning the risk of breast cancer that are based on common genetic variation. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that the risk profile generated by the known, common, moderate-risk alleles does not provide sufficient discrimination to warrant individualized prevention. However, useful risk stratification may be possible in the context of programs for disease prevention in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical use of single, common, low-penetrance genes is limited, but a few susceptibility alleles may distinguish women who are at high risk for breast cancer from those who are at low risk, particularly in the context of population screening.&lt;/Abstract&gt;\n&lt;BookTitle&gt;Book2&lt;/BookTitle&gt;\n&lt;Publisher&gt;Publisher02, New York&lt;/Publisher&gt;\n&lt;Edition&gt;3rd&lt;/Edition&gt;\n&lt;EditorList&gt;\n&lt;Editor&gt;\n    &lt;LastName&gt;Bernstein&lt;/LastName&gt;\n    &lt;ForeName&gt;Arthur&lt;/ForeName&gt;\n    &lt;Initials&gt;A&lt;/Initials&gt;\n&lt;/Editor&gt;\n&lt;/EditorList&gt;\n&lt;Page&gt;2796-803&lt;/Page&gt;\n&lt;Year&gt;2008&lt;/Year&gt;\n&lt;AuthorList&gt;\n            &lt;Author ValidYN=\"Y\"&gt;\n                &lt;LastName&gt;Pharoah&lt;/LastName&gt;\n                &lt;ForeName&gt;Paul D P&lt;/ForeName&gt;\n                &lt;Initials&gt;PD&lt;/Initials&gt;\n            &lt;/Author&gt;\n            &lt;Author ValidYN=\"Y\"&gt;\n                &lt;LastName&gt;Antoniou&lt;/LastName&gt;\n                &lt;ForeName&gt;Antonis C&lt;/ForeName&gt;\n                &lt;Initials&gt;AC&lt;/Initials&gt;\n            &lt;/Author&gt;\n            &lt;Author ValidYN=\"Y\"&gt;\n                &lt;LastName&gt;Easton&lt;/LastName&gt;\n                &lt;ForeName&gt;Douglas F&lt;/ForeName&gt;\n                &lt;Initials&gt;DF&lt;/Initials&gt;\n            &lt;/Author&gt;\n            &lt;Author ValidYN=\"Y\"&gt;\n                &lt;LastName&gt;Ponder&lt;/LastName&gt;\n                &lt;ForeName&gt;Bruce A J&lt;/ForeName&gt;\n                &lt;Initials&gt;BA&lt;/Initials&gt;\n            &lt;/Author&gt;\n&lt;/AuthorList&gt;\n//\n&lt;PaperTitle&gt;Invasive breast cancer: predicting disease recurrence by using high-spatial-resolution signal enhancement ratio imaging.&lt;/PaperTitle&gt;\n&lt;Abstract&gt;PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate high-spatial-resolution signal enhancement ratio (SER) imaging for the prediction of disease recurrence in patients with breast cancer who underwent preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant; informed consent was waived. From 1995 to 2002, gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging data were acquired with a three time point high-resolution method in women undergoing neoadjuvant therapy for invasive breast cancers. Forty-eight women (mean age, 49.1 years; range, 29.7-72.4 years) were divided into recurrence-free or recurrence groups. Volume measurements were tabulated for SER values between set ranges; cutoff criteria were defined to predict disease recurrence after surgery. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model were used for evaluation. RESULTS: Breast tumor volume calculated from the number of voxels with SER values above a threshold corresponding to the upper limit of mean redistribution rate constant in benign tumors (0.88 minutes(-1)) and the volume of cancerous breast tissue infiltrating into the parenchyma were important predictors of disease recurrence. Seventy-five percent of patients with recurrence and 100% of deceased patients were identified as being at high risk for recurrence. Thirty percent of patients with recurrence and 67% of deceased patients were identified as having high risk before chemotherapy. No patients in the recurrence-free group were misidentified as likely to have recurrence. All three prechemotherapy parameters (total tumor volume, tumor volumes with high and low SER) and the postchemotherapy tumor volume with high SER were significantly different between the two groups. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression showed that, of the three prechemotherapy covariates, only the low SER and high SER tumor volumes (P = .017 and .049, respectively) were significant and independent predictors of tumor recurrence. Tumor volume with high SER was the only significant postchemotherapy covariate predictor (P = .038). CONCLUSION: High-spatial-resolution SER imaging may improve prediction for patients at high risk for disease recurrence and death.&lt;/Abstract&gt;\n&lt;BookTitle&gt;Book3&lt;/BookTitle&gt;\n&lt;Publisher&gt;Publisher03, London&lt;/Publisher&gt;\n&lt;Edition&gt;3rd&lt;/Edition&gt;\n&lt;EditorList&gt;\n&lt;Editor&gt;\n

One way to do this (*which assumes you are not changing the data anywhere else*) is to simply call `total()` in the listener for changes in the search field&#39;s text property:\r\n\r\n    private void searchData() {\r\n        FilteredList&lt;Data&gt; filteredData = new FilteredList&lt;&gt;(getDataList(), b -&gt; true);\r\n        search.textProperty().addListener((observable, oldValue, newValue) -&gt; {\r\n            filteredData.setPredicate(Data -&gt; {\r\n                if(newValue.isEmpty() || newValue.isBlank()) {\r\n                    return true;\r\n                }\r\n                String lowerCase = newValue.toLowerCase();\r\n                if(Data.getName().toLowerCase().contains(lowerCase)) {\r\n                    return true;\r\n                }\r\n                else if(Data.getCategory().toLowerCase().contains(lowerCase)) {\r\n                    return true;\r\n                }\r\n                else if(String.valueOf(Data.getPrice()).toLowerCase().contains(lowerCase)) {\r\n                    return true;\r\n                }\r\n                else\r\n                    return String.valueOf(Data.getDate()).toLowerCase().contains(lowerCase);\r\n\r\n            });\r\n\r\n            total();\r\n\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        SortedList&lt;Data&gt; sortedData = new SortedList&lt;&gt;(filteredData);\r\n        sortedData.comparatorProperty().bind(table.comparatorProperty());\r\n        table.setItems(sortedData);\r\n        total();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe assumption that you are not changing the data anywhere else is probably too big an assumption. (Even if you are not doing so now, you might want to add functionality to add new data into your table, for example, and in that circumstance the total would not be updated when you add new data.)

JSON serialization libraries expect date strings to be in a specific format, and when the value doesn&#39;t conform to that format, parsing errors occur.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nIn my opinion a good solution is **customize date serialization**, this way:\r\n\r\nFirst, create a custom serializer for the `Date` class that formats dates as strings in a specific format.

I want it to be performed better</p>\n<p>Update:</p>\n<pre><code>    BigtableDataClient dataClient\n            = BigtableDataClient.create(projectId, instanceId);\n    // Limit parallelism of concurrent requests\n    Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(100);\n    // Use strip filter as we just need the rowkeys\n    Filters.Filter stripFfilter = Filters.FILTERS.value().strip();\n    Query myQuery = Query.create(tableId).prefix(prefix).filter(stripFfilter);\n\n    List&lt;KeyOffset&gt; keyOffsets = null;\n    try {\n        keyOffsets = dataClient.sampleRowKeysCallable().call(tableId);\n\n        List&lt;Query&gt; queryShards = myQuery.shard(keyOffsets);\n        CountDownLatch taskTracker = new CountDownLatch(queryShards.size());\n        List&lt;Throwable&gt; errors = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList&lt;&gt;());\n        AtomicLong totalCount = new AtomicLong();\n\n        for (Query subQuery : queryShards) {\n            semaphore.acquire();\n            dataClient.readRowsAsync(subQuery, new ResponseObserver&lt;&gt;() {\n                long subCount = 0;\n\n                @Override\n                public void onStart(StreamController controller) {\n\n                }\n\n                @Override\n                public void onResponse(Row response) {\n                    subCount++;\n                }\n\n                @Override\n                public void onError(Throwable t) {\n                    errors.add(t);\n                    taskTracker.countDown();\n                    semaphore.release();\n                }\n\n                @Override\n                public void onComplete() {\n                    totalCount.addAndGet(subCount);\n                    taskTracker.countDown();\n                    semaphore.release();\n                }\n            });\n        }\n        taskTracker.await();\n    } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n        throw new RuntimeException(e);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":9910,"page":224,"page_size":100}
