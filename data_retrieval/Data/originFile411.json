It&#39;s being done using Java with the glue from jocl.org. I suspect that there&#39;s some fundamental issue about memory management or threads that I&#39;m not aware of.\r\n\r\nAs an initial trial, the OpenCL code takes a 1D array of source bytes that represents a 2D image and samples it to form a smaller dest image. The fact that this data represents an image is irrelevant for what follows, aside from the fact that the src and dest images have width and height used to index into the arrays.\r\n\r\nThe program works the first time it&#39;s called, and it *might* work for a 2nd and 3rd time, but it will quickly bomb. I&#39;ve been playing with this for a while now, and the exact error reported varies so much that I think it&#39;s something fundamental.

The next time the component is painted it will be lost. 3) Instead I suggest you use Swing and read the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/painting/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Custom Painting</a> tutorial for the basics."},{"owner":{"account_id":44852,"reputation":322224,"user_id":131872,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"camickr"},"score":1,"creation_date":1685045787,"post_id":76335283,"comment_id":134610515,"body_markdown":"3) See: [Using Top-Level Containers](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/toplevel.html) to better understand the parent/child relationship. 4) You can also search the site for examples that use the GradientPaint class.","body":"3) See: <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/toplevel.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Using Top-Level Containers</a> to better understand the parent/child relationship. 4) You can also search the site for examples that use the GradientPaint class."}],"owner":{"account_id":18370703,"reputation":1,"user_id":13380852,"display_name":"Gabrioche"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1685039421,"creation_date":1685039421,"question_id":76335283,"body_markdown":"**Background gradient not showing java awt**\r\n\r\nI am trying to create a simple window with a gradient background.

I couldn't find any documentation about how to receive callbacks when hardware buttons are pressed.</p>\n<pre><code>OSMOMobileHandheldController osmoMobileHandheldController = new OSMOMobileHandheldController();\n    osmoMobileHandheldController.setHardwareStateCallback(hardwareState -&gt; {\n\n        switch (hardwareState.getRecordAndShutterButtons()) {\n            case IDLE: {\n                Log.e(TAG, &quot;getRecordAndShutterButtons IDLE&quot;);\n                break;\n            }\n            case RECORD_CLICK: {\n                Log.e(TAG, &quot;getRecordAndShutterButtons RECORD_CLICK&quot;);\n                break;\n            }\n            case SHUTTER_CLICK: {\n                Log.e(TAG, &quot;getRecordAndShutterButtons SHUTTER_CLICK&quot;);\n                break;\n            }\n            case SHUTTER_LONG_CLICK: {\n                Log.e(TAG, &quot;getRecordAndShutterButtons SHUTTER_LONG_CLICK&quot;);\n                break;\n            }\n            default: {\n                Log.e(TAG, &quot;getRecordAndShutterButtons UNKNOWN&quot;);\n            }\n        }\n        \n        switch (hardwareState.getZoomState()) {\n            case IDLE: {\n                Log.e(TAG, &quot;getZoomState IDLE&quot;);\n                break;\n            }\n            case ZOOM_IN: {\n                Log.e(TAG, &quot;getZoomState ZOOM_IN&quot;);\n                break;\n            }\n            case ZOOM_OUT: {\n                Log.e(TAG, &quot;getZoomState ZOOM_OUT&quot;);\n                break;\n            }\n            default: {\n                Log.e(TAG, &quot;getTriggerButton UNKNOWN&quot;);\n            }\n        }\n\n    });\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","maven"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":26177,"reputation":7590,"user_id":67872,"accept_rate":86,"display_name":"StefanE"},"score":0,"creation_date":1506094575,"post_id":46368197,"comment_id":79696325,"body_markdown":"I always use spring boot functionaly with a yaml file with the different values... https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-loading-yaml","body":"I always use spring boot functionaly with a yaml file with the different values... <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-loading-yaml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/&hellip;</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":195691,"reputation":28439,"user_id":438742,"accept_rate":73,"display_name":"kan"},"score":0,"creation_date":1506095296,"post_id":46368197,"comment_id":79696689,"body_markdown":"Much easier if you would create env-specific prop files i.e. `default.properties`, `env1.properties`, etc","body":"Much easier if you would create env-specific prop files i.e. <code>default.properties</code>, <code>env1.properties</code>, etc"},{"owner":{"account_id":6317022,"reputation":3182,"user_id":4906586,"accept_rate":88,"display_name":"Al-un"},"score":0,"creation_date":1506107408,"post_id":46368197,"comment_id":79702867,"body_markdown":"Agreed with @kan: your variable `env` will specify which property file to pick up when defining `build &gt; resources` in your pom.xml","body":"Agreed with @kan: your variable <code>env</code> will specify which property file to pick up when defining <code>build &gt; resources</code> in your pom.xml"},{"owner":{"account_id":112317,"reputation":93949,"user_id":296328,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"khmarbaise"},"score":0,"creation_date":1506159291,"post_id":46368197,"comment_id":79714760,"body_markdown":"For what kind of requirement you need to use properties-maven-plugin...?

One of the WAR files is using Hibernate 4.3.x and JPA 2.1 and appears to be working ok, but the other WAR file (mostly 3rd party code) is using Hibernate 3.6.x and JPA 2.0.</p>\n<p>Somehow someone managed to magically make that all work under JBoss 7.1.x, but I've bene unable to repeat that magic under WildFly 8.2.x and keep getting exceptions such as the following:</p>\n<pre><code>org.springframework.web.util.NestedServletException: Request processing failed; nested exception is org.springframework.webflow.execution.FlowExecutionException: Exception thrown in state 'ipaidLoginForm' of flow 'login'\n[...]\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.hibernate.jpa.HibernatePersistenceProvider cannot be cast to javax.persistence.spi.PersistenceProvider\n    at javax.persistence.Persistence$1.isLoaded(Persistence.java:92)\n    at org.hibernate.validator.internal.engine.resolver.JPATraversableResolver.isReachable(JPATraversableResolver.java:56)\n    at org.hibernate.validator.internal.engine.resolver.DefaultTraversableResolver.isReachable(DefaultTraversableResolver.java:137)\n    at org.hibernate.validator.internal.engine.resolver.CachingTraversableResolverForSingleValidation.isReachable(CachingTraversableResolverForSingleValidation.java:46)\n    at org.hibernate.validator.internal.engine.ValidatorImpl.isReachable(ValidatorImpl.java:1396)\n    ... 75 more\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have been trying just about every combination I can think of to include / exclude versions of Hibernate and JPA.  I believe the solution should be the exclude the WildFly built-in Hibernate and JPA and use the two versions that are bundled in my two WARs.</p>\n<p>My jboss-deployment-structure.xml file looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;jboss-deployment-structure xmlns=&quot;urn:jboss:deployment-structure:1.0&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;ear-subdeployments-isolated&gt;false&lt;/ear-subdeployments-isolated&gt;\n    &lt;deployment&gt;\n        &lt;exclusions&gt;\n            &lt;module name=&quot;org.hibernate&quot; /&gt;\n            &lt;module name=&quot;javax.persistence.api&quot; /&gt;\n            &lt;module name=&quot;org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-jackson-provider&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;/exclusions&gt;\n        &lt;dependencies&gt;\n            &lt;module name=&quot;javax.servlet.jstl.api&quot; export=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;\n            &lt;module name=&quot;org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy-jackson2-provider&quot; services=&quot;import&quot; /&gt;\n            &lt;module name=&quot;com.fasterxml.jackson.jaxrs.jackson-jaxrs-json-provider&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;/dependencies&gt;\n    &lt;/deployment&gt;\n&lt;/jboss-deployment-structure&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The WAR file that is not working has the following persistence.xml:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;persistence xmlns=&quot;http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence&quot;\n        xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\n        xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_0.xsd&quot;\n        version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;persistence-unit name=&quot;CasPersistence&quot; transaction-type=&quot;RESOURCE_LOCAL&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;provider&gt;org.hibernate.ejb.HibernatePersistence&lt;/provider&gt;\n        &lt;class&gt;org.jasig.cas.services.AbstractRegisteredService&lt;/class&gt;\n        &lt;class&gt;org.jasig.cas.services.RegexRegisteredService&lt;/class&gt;\n        &lt;class&gt;org.jasig.cas.services.RegisteredServiceImpl&lt;/class&gt;\n        &lt;class&gt;org.jasig.cas.ticket.TicketGrantingTicketImpl&lt;/class&gt;\n        &lt;class&gt;org.jasig.cas.ticket.ServiceTicketImpl&lt;/class&gt;\n        &lt;class&gt;org.jasig.cas.ticket.registry.support.JpaLockingStrategy$Lock&lt;/class&gt;\n        &lt;!-- DriveSync specific change - Add proper for hibernate cache --&gt;\n        &lt;properties&gt;\n            &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.cache.region.factory_class&quot; value=&quot;net.sf.ehcache.hibernate.EhCacheRegionFactory&quot;/&gt;\n        &lt;/properties&gt;\n    &lt;/persistence-unit&gt;\n&lt;/persistence&gt;\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Somehow, the WAR file that is working doesn't seem to have a persistence.xml at all?

Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(CustomMariaDB53Dialect.class);\r\n\r\n    public CustomMariaDB53Dialect() {\r\n        super();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then register a function to the

LoggerFactory.getLogger(CustomMariaDB53Dialect.class);\r\n\r\n    public CustomMariaDB53Dialect() {\r\n        super();\r\n        registerFunction(&quot;convertEncode&quot;, new

implement of `SqlFunction`\r\n\r\nThe `?1` and `?2` means the args of the function\r\nSo the function template is `convert(?1 using ?2)`\r\n\r\nAfter above stpes done. \r\n\r\nYou should tell the hibernate you are using a new Dialect\r\n\r\nThe path of the config is `hibernate.dialect`\r\n\r\nHere is the example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhibernate.dialect=xxx.xxx.CustomMariaDB53Dialect \r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using spring boot jpa.\r\n\r\nHere is the config:\r\n```\r\nspring:\r\n  jpa:\r\n    hibernate:\r\n    properties:\r\n      hibernate:\r\n        dialect:
