Take this for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {\n    String[] strList1 = {\"ABC\", \"CDE\", \"EFG\", \"ABC\"};\n    String[] strList2 = {\"ABC\", \"EFG\", \"CDE\", \"CDE\"};\n    System.out.println(arrayEquals(strList1,strList2));\n}\nprivate static boolean arrayEquals(String[] array1, String[] array2) {\n    List&lt;String&gt; list1 = Arrays.asList(array1);\n    List&lt;String&gt; list2 = Arrays.asList(array2);\n    return list1.containsAll(list2) &amp;&amp; list2.containsAll(list1);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case, strList1 has a duplicate for \"ABC\" and strList2 has a duplicate for \"CDE\", but they still match because their unique elements are still the same, when the array it self is different.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 3</strong></p>\n\n<p>Thanks everyone that have answered.\nSo after a lot of back and forth, it seems the shortest way to do it is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    String[] strList1 = {\"ABC\", \"CDE\", \"EFG\", \"CDE\", \"EFG\"};\n    String[] strList2 = {\"ABC\", \"EFG\", \"CDE\", \"EFG\", \"CDE\"};\n\n    Arrays.sort(strList1);\n    Arrays.sort(strList2);\n    boolean exactMatch = Arrays.deepEquals(strList1, strList2);\n\n    System.out.println(\"test3 - match: \" + exactMatch);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I was hoping for one method call that could do it all, but it seems there is done.\nArrays.deepEquals() only works with sorted arrays if all elements are different in order.\nThe approach with contains() does not work as there are duplicates.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","refactoring","methods","intellij-idea"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3019457,"reputation":3814,"user_id":2560836,"accept_rate":80,"display_name":"Chris311"},"score":0,"creation_date":1480326761,"post_id":2827308,"comment_id":68899832,"body_markdown":"I think the best solution would be a formatting tool that orders your methods automatically.

Or is it calculate by the JVM at runtime?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I'm also curious about does the order of parameters / variable of <code>obj.test()</code> in the stack has a specific order, just like C has calling convention, or it is depend on the implementation of VM?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>I know <code>this</code> is a keyword instead of a normal reference variable, but my primary concern about this example, is how JVM knows where does object laid in the heap?</p>\n\n<p>Or in other words, how can JVM knows what is the current object of a member method at runtime, so they can get access to those instance variable? </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","object","collections","set","hashset"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":23959668,"reputation":26587,"user_id":17949945,"display_name":"Alexander Ivanchenko"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1665159107,"creation_date":1665159107,"answer_id":73989924,"question_id":73989312,"body_markdown":"There are several issues related to you `Card` class and its usage:\r\n\r\n* Don&#39;t break Encapsulation, use access modifiers to protect class members, and getters to expose information.

I isolated the problem to the code below and found a specific number on which the code starts to hang - `256`.

I definitely don't get why this happens at all and where <code>256</code> comes from.</p>\n<p>Here is the code which hangs:</p>\n<pre><code>@ParameterizedTest\n@ValueSource(ints = {250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256})\nvoid freezeTest(int uniqueStringsCount) {\n  var scheduler = Schedulers\n      .newBoundedElastic(\n          1000,\n          1000,\n          &quot;really-big-scheduler&quot;\n      );\n  Flux.range(0, uniqueStringsCount)\n      .map(Object::toString)\n      .repeat()\n      // this represents &quot;a lot of events&quot;\n      .take(50_000)\n      .groupBy(x -&gt; x)\n      // this gets the same results\n      // .parallel(400)\n      .parallel()\n      .flatMap(group -&gt;\n          group.concatMap(e -&gt;\n\n              // this represents a processing operation on each event\n              Mono.fromRunnable(() -&gt; {\n                    try {\n                      Thread.sleep(0);\n                    } catch (InterruptedException ex) {\n                      throw new RuntimeException(ex);\n                    }\n                  })\n\n              // this also doesn't work\n              // Mono.delay(Duration.ofMillis(0))\n              // Mono.empty()\n\n          // big scheduler doesn't help either\n          // ).subscribeOn(scheduler)\n          )\n      // ).runOn(scheduler)\n      ).runOn(Schedulers.parallel())\n      .then()\n      .block();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We first construct a <code>Flux</code> with a lot of (50k, just an example) <code>String</code>s. But there are only some number of unique strings in that <code>Flux</code>, which is that split up in that number of groups that are processed in parallel. But events within each group are processed sequentially via <code>concatMap</code>. And this code hangs only on <code>256</code> unique strings.</p>\n<p>Initially, I thought that some thread pool somewhere is exhausted, so I added a <code>really-big-scheduler</code> to test that - but it only executes slower and also hangs on <code>256</code>.\nThen I tried removing blocking <code>Thread.sleep</code> (I started with that since my real implementation is possibly blocking) - but it also hangs on <code>256</code>\nAlso, changing <code>parallelism</code> (<code>400</code> in the code above) doesn't change anything.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","string-concatenation"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":7358121,"reputation":4925,"user_id":5602214,"display_name":"Prashant"},"score":2,"creation_date":1568607611,"post_id":57950252,"comment_id":102313126,"body_markdown":"`stringArray[a-1].append(stringArray[b-1]);` itself is `O(n)`.

Computers are, in the end, bit based. With bits we can represent numbers, and with numbers we can represent characters. Which number represents which character? Well, you tell me. In the olden days the answered depended on the country you bought that computer from, or the language you configured your OS to be when you installed it. Mostly because it was too inefficient to attempt to represent characters with anything but a byte, and bytes only cover 0-255 - there are more characters in use on the planet than that, so the german computers had a number for the &#252; character, and the icelandic ones for the ∂, and the turkish ones for the dotless i, and so on. The russian one was completely different (cyrillic), now imagine chinese and japanese ones.\r\n\r\nUnicode fixes this by having one table for all of it. Naturally, the table is much larger than 256 entries.\r\n\r\n97 is the unicode table id for the &#39;a&#39; character.\r\n\r\nThe unicode value for the character &#39;0&#39; is 48. Fortunately, 1 is 49, and so on, so if you want to translate `&#39;5&#39;` to `5`, subtract 48. Which is hard to remember, except... `&#39;0&#39;` __is__ 48, just like `0x10` and `16` and `020` are all the same number, just in different writing styles.\r\n\r\nSo you can just write:\r\n\r\n```\r\nint v = &#39;5&#39; - &#39;0&#39;;\r\nSystem.out.println(v); // Prints 5!\r\n```\r\n\r\n### So why does `System.out.println(&#39;a&#39;)` _not_ print 97?\r\n\r\nBecause `println` is coded like that. `println` is overloaded: There are many methods all named `println`, in java the paramtype is part of the method name effectively. So you get the `char` version of it, and it looks the number up in the unicode table and then prints that. You&#39;re still passing 97 to the method. It&#39;s just that the method reacts to being passed 97 by printing &#39;a&#39;, not by printing 97 (which is what the `println` variant that takes an `int` does).\r\n\r\n### So why can I return it if my method return type `int`?\r\n\r\nBecause java has silent widening, as per the spec. Anytime you use a numeric type A when what you actually need is numeric type B, but A is &#39;smaller&#39; than B (B can represent everything A can, and more), then it is not an error; java simply assumes you meant to convert it and injects that conversion for you:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbyte b = 10;\r\nint c = b; // legal.\r\nint c = (int) b; // de-syntax-sugared\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that `char` represents 0-65535, and `int` can represent from -2147483648 to +2147483647, every `char` fits, and therefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\nchar c = &#39;a&#39;; // legal\r\nc = 97; // so is this.\r\nint d = c; // and so is this\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other way around doesn&#39;t:\r\n\r\n```\r\nchar c = &#39;a&#39;;\r\nbyte b = c; // nope\r\nbyte b = (byte) c; // legal\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Isn&#39;t unicode much larger than 65536 entries?\r\n\r\nYeah.

So <em>every attempt</em> to add an item would trigger a rehash and doubling of size, until you ran out of memory.</p>\n<p>What you originally wanted:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the initial capacity is greater than the maximum number of entries divided by the load factor, no rehash operations will ever occur.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you create a HashMap with a capacity M &gt; N, a load factor of 1, and add N items, it will not grow.</p>\n<pre><code>Map&lt;KeyType, ValueType&gt; nonGrowingHashMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(MAXIMUM_MAP_SIZE, 1.0f);\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":19578,"reputation":22026,"user_id":45963,"accept_rate":79,"display_name":"andandandand"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":102814,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":45,"accepted_answer_id":5601374,"answer_count":6,"score":45,"last_activity_date":1665151849,"creation_date":1302300953,"question_id":5601333,"body_markdown":"I want to limit the maximum size of a `HashMap` to take metrics on a variety of hashing algorithms that I&#39;m implementing.
