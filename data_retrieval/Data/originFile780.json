You need 2 controllers for exactly the same practical reason, so that they provide for same input exactly the same output, but to be available from 2 different URLs. If this is the case then you can use just 1 controller and allow it to be executed for both URLs. See the following code to achieve this:\r\n\r\n       @RequestMapping({&quot;/s/*&quot;, &quot;/s2/*})\r\n       public String myMethod(HttpServletRequest request) {\r\n           return &quot;some response&quot;;\r\n       }\r\n3. You need to expose only 1 URL to the client which will serve everything. Then the approach with forward will also not benefit you, since the client will be able to reach the other forwarded controller directly if he wishes so. In this case you can implement 1 single controller which then according to the needs builds different responses. You can do this in `RestController` although not suggested by Sonar and other code review tools by marking the method to return `ResponseEntity&lt;?&gt;`. Example: \r\n\r\n         @RequestMapping(&quot;/s/*&quot;)\r\n         public ResponseEntity&lt;?&gt; myMethod(HttpServletRequest request) {\r\n               if (condition 1) {\r\n                   return new ResponseEntity&lt;YourObject1&gt;(HttpStatus.OK);\r\n               } else if (condition 2) {\r\n                   return new ResponseEntity&lt;YourObject2&gt;(HttpStatus.OK);\r\n               } else {\r\n                   return new ResponseEntity&lt;YourObject3&gt;(HttpStatus.OK);\r\n               }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    this last choice is not considered best practice with `&lt;?&gt;` but for this requirement I don&#39;t see any other way out.","title":"Spring Boot.

I am now attempting to compile the Gradle project, but it isn&#39;t compiling, even if it was building and compiling successfully when I used Maven. \r\n\r\nI ran `gradle init` to convert my project to Gradle and it stopped compiling and gave me the &quot;cannot find symbol&quot; errors. It seems as though Gradle cannot find many classes, including the `Main` class.\r\n\r\nI have effectively read through the post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25706216/what-does-a-cannot-find-symbol-or-cannot-resolve-symbol-error-mean and I was unable to fix my issue. I know it&#39;s a compilation error, but I don&#39;t know what&#39;s causing it. I didn&#39;t change the code when I switched from Maven to Gradle, only the build files.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of one of the errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        Main instance = Main.getInstance();\r\n                            ^\r\n  symbol:   method getInstance()\r\n  location: class Main\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: the build is a multi-project build. It has several subprojects. Here is the mother build.gradle file:\r\n```clojure\r\nplugins {\r\n    id &quot;java&quot;\r\n    id &quot;com.github.johnrengelman.shadow&quot; version &quot;7.1.2&quot;\r\n    id &quot;war&quot;\r\n}\r\n\r\ngroup &quot;net.pixlies&quot;\r\nversion &quot;1.0-SNAPSHOT&quot;\r\n\r\njava {\r\n    toolchain {\r\n        languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(17)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nsubprojects {\r\n    compileJava.options.encoding = &quot;UTF-8&quot;\r\n\r\n    apply plugin: &quot;java&quot;\r\n    apply plugin: &quot;war&quot;\r\n    apply plugin: &quot;com.github.johnrengelman.shadow&quot;\r\n\r\n    compileJava {\r\n        sourceCompatibility = 17\r\n        targetCompatibility = 17\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nrepositories {\r\n    mavenCentral()\r\n    maven { url &quot;https://repo.purpurmc.org/snapshots/&quot; }\r\n    maven { url &quot;https://repo.extendedclip.com/content/repositories/placeholderapi/&quot; }\r\n    maven { url &quot;https://repo.aikar.co/content/groups/aikar/&quot; }\r\n    maven { url &quot;https://repo.dmulloy2.net/repository/public/&quot; }\r\n}\r\n\r\ndependencies {\r\n    implementation &quot;org.mongodb:mongo-java-driver:3.12.11&quot;\r\n    implementation &quot;commons-io:commons-io:2.11.0&quot;\r\n    implementation &quot;co.aikar:acf-paper:0.5.1-SNAPSHOT&quot;\r\n    implementation &quot;org.ocpsoft.prettytime:prettytime:5.0.3.Final&quot;\r\n    implementation &quot;commons-lang:commons-lang:2.6&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the settings.gradle file:\r\n```\r\npluginManagement {\r\n    repositories {\r\n        gradlePluginPortal()\r\n        maven { url &quot;https://papermc.io/repo/repository/maven-public/&quot; }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nrootProject.name = &#39;version-two&#39;\r\n\r\ninclude(&#39;:PixliesCore&#39;)\r\ninclude(&#39;:LobbyModule&#39;)\r\ninclude(&#39;:MiniMick&#39;)\r\ninclude(&#39;:ProtoBusiness&#39;)\r\ninclude(&#39;:PixliesFun&#39;)\r\ninclude(&#39;:Nations&#39;)\r\ninclude(&#39;:DiploMaurice&#39;)\r\ninclude(&#39;:PixliesProxyCore&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe PixliesCore project is having these issues with the &quot;Cannot find symbol&quot; error. Here is the `PixliesCore` subproject build.gradle file:\r\n```clojure\r\nplugins {\r\n    id &#39;net.pixlies.java-conventions&#39;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndependencies {\r\n    implementation &#39;com.github.stefvanschie.inventoryframework:IF:0.10.7&#39;\r\n    implementation &#39;org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.24&#39;\r\n    implementation &#39;redis.clients:jedis:4.2.3&#39;\r\n    implementation &#39;joda-time:joda-time:2.11.1&#39;\r\n    compileOnly &#39;org.purpurmc.purpur:purpur-api:1.19-R0.1-SNAPSHOT&#39;\r\n    compileOnly &#39;com.comphenix.protocol:ProtocolLib:4.7.0&#39;\r\n    compileOnly &#39;me.clip:placeholderapi:2.11.2&#39;\r\n    compileOnly &#39;net.luckperms:api:5.4&#39;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndescription = &#39;PixliesCore&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also ran `./gradlew assemble` in the mother project&#39;s directory. Here is the output:\r\n```\r\nFAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\r\n\r\n* What went wrong:\r\nExecution failed for task &#39;:PixliesCore:compileJava&#39;.\r\n&gt; invalid source release: 17\r\n```\r\nPerhaps this &quot;invalid source release&quot; is the cause, but I do not know what it means or how to fix it. I&#39;m using the Java 17 SDK for everything.\r\n\r\nOh, also, here is the original POM.xml for the mother project:\r\n```\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

I am now attempting to compile the Gradle project, but it isn't compiling, even if it was building and compiling successfully when I used Maven.</p>\n<p>I ran <code>gradle init</code> to convert my project to Gradle and it stopped compiling and gave me the &quot;cannot find symbol&quot; errors. It seems as though Gradle cannot find many classes, including the <code>Main</code> class.</p>\n<p>I have effectively read through the post: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25706216/what-does-a-cannot-find-symbol-or-cannot-resolve-symbol-error-mean\">What does a &quot;Cannot find symbol&quot; or &quot;Cannot resolve symbol&quot; error mean?</a> and I was unable to fix my issue. I know it's a compilation error, but I don't know what's causing it. I didn't change the code when I switched from Maven to Gradle, only the build files.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of one of the errors:</p>\n<pre><code>        Main instance = Main.getInstance();\n                            ^\n  symbol:   method getInstance()\n  location: class Main\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: the build is a multi-project build. It has several subprojects.

So, either:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Don't bind the AntRun plugin to the <code>test</code> phase, move the configuration outside the <code>execution</code> and call <code>mvn antrun:run</code> on the command line to generate the reports when wanted.  </p></li>\n<li><p>or use the <a href=\"http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#testFailureIgnore\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>testFailureIgnore</code></a> option of the test mojo and set it to true in the surefire plugin configuration:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;plugin&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-surefire-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;configuration&gt;\n    &lt;testFailureIgnore&gt;true&lt;/testFailureIgnore&gt;\n  &lt;/configuration&gt;\n&lt;/plugin&gt;\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>or set this expression from the command line using the -D parameter:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ mvn test -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true\n</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I think that Option #1 is the best option, you don't necessarily want to generate the reports (especially when the test passes) and generate them systematically may slow down the build on the long term. I'd generate them \"on demand\".</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":79836,"reputation":7137,"user_id":226114,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"Y.H Wong"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1274260577,"creation_date":1274260213,"answer_id":2864157,"question_id":2846493,"body_markdown":"Thanks for Pascal, I&#39;ve found an improved solution to do what I want to do:\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n        &lt;!-- Extended Maven antrun plugin --&gt;\r\n        &lt;!-- https://maven-antrun-extended-plugin.dev.java.net/ --&gt;\r\n        &lt;groupId&gt;org.jvnet.maven-antrun-extended-plugin&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-antrun-extended-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;executions&gt;\r\n          &lt;execution&gt;\r\n            &lt;id&gt;test-reports&lt;/id&gt;\r\n            &lt;phase&gt;test&lt;/phase&gt;\r\n            &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n              &lt;tasks&gt;\r\n                &lt;junitreport todir=&quot;target/surefire-reports&quot;&gt;\r\n                  &lt;fileset dir=&quot;target/surefire-reports&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;include name=&quot;**/*.xml&quot;/&gt;\r\n                  &lt;/fileset&gt;\r\n                  &lt;report format=&quot;noframes&quot; todir=&quot;target/surefire-reports&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;/junitreport&gt;\r\n              &lt;/tasks&gt;\r\n            &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n            &lt;goals&gt;\r\n              &lt;goal&gt;run&lt;/goal&gt;\r\n            &lt;/goals&gt;\r\n          &lt;/execution&gt;\r\n        &lt;/executions&gt;\r\n        &lt;dependencies&gt;\r\n          &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.ant&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;ant-junit&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;1.8.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n          &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n          &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.ant&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;ant-trax&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;1.8.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n          &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependencies&gt;\r\n      &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nThis version uses a newer version of ant and best of all.

If one of the higher priority listeners &quot;consumes the event&quot; then the lower listeners *will not be called*. \r\n\r\nIn your case these three listeners are called in order: \r\n\r\n1. OnTouchListener\r\n2. OnFocusChangeListener\r\n3. OnClickListener \r\n\r\nThe first time the user touches an EditText it receives focus so that the user can type. *The action is consumed here.*  Therefor the lower priority OnClickListener is not called. Each successive touch doesn&#39;t change the focus so these events trickle down to the OnClickListener.\r\n\r\nButtons (and other such components) don&#39;t receive focus from a touch event, that&#39;s why the OnClickListener is called every time.\r\n\r\n**Basically,** you have three choices:\r\n\r\n1. Implement an OnTouchListener by itself:\r\n\r\n        ed1.setOnTouchListener(new OnTouchListener() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {\r\n                if(MotionEvent.ACTION_UP == event.getAction())\r\n                    editTextClicked(); // Instead of your Toast\r\n                return false;\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n    This will execute every time the EditText is touched. Notice that the listener returns `false`, this allows the event to trickle down to the built-in OnFocusChangeListener which changes the focus so the user can type in the EditText. \r\n\r\n2. Implement an OnFocusChangeListener along with the OnClickListener:\r\n\r\n        ed1.setOnFocusChangeListener(new OnFocusChangeListener() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void onFocusChange(View v, boolean hasFocus) {\r\n                if(hasFocus)\r\n                    editTextClicked(); // Instead of your Toast\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n    This listener catches the first touch event when the focus is changed while your OnClickListener catches every other event.\r\n\r\n3. (This isn&#39;t a valid answer here, but it is a good trick to know.) Set the focusable attribute to `false` in your XML:\r\n\r\n        android:focusable=&quot;false&quot;\r\n\r\n    Now the OnClickListener will fire _every_ time it is clicked. But this makes the EditText useless since the user can no longer enter any text...\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\n[`getApplicationContext()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#getApplicationContext()) can create memory leaks.

So I'd rather not do this.</p>\n<p>Is there another way to get asSql() functionality from a ClientPreparedStatement?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","xml","dom"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":47283,"reputation":703817,"user_id":139985,"accept_rate":69,"display_name":"Stephen C"},"score":0,"creation_date":1671686564,"post_id":74884348,"comment_id":132153068,"body_markdown":"Please show us the code you are currently using to get the caseResult elements.","body":"Please show us the code you are currently using to get the caseResult elements."},{"owner":{"account_id":36083,"reputation":11748,"user_id":102689,"accept_rate":57,"display_name":"Srinivasan"},"score":0,"creation_date":1671687544,"post_id":74884348,"comment_id":132153189,"body_markdown":"added java code also","body":"added java code also"},{"owner":{"account_id":19414861,"reputation":443,"user_id":14198583,"display_name":"Christopher"},"score":1,"creation_date":1671723100,"post_id":74884348,"comment_id":132163372,"body_markdown":"I assume by &quot;get all in one&quot; you mean to get these in a single loop.
