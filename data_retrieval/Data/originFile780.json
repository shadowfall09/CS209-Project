Don&#39;t worry about all these errors (if you got them) now.\r\n\r\n[![image][3]][3]\r\n\r\nOk. Now, do what you did to crash your app. After your app crashes, go to your logcat. You should find a new crash log that has a lot of `at:x.x.x`: and `Caused by: TrumpIsPresidentException` for example. Go to that `Caused by:` statement in your logcat.\r\n\r\n[![image][4]][4]\r\n\r\n**Next to** that `Caused By:`, there should be the Exception that happened. In my case, it&#39;s a `RuntimeException` and **under it** there should be a line that contains a **blue link** such as:\r\n\r\n[![image][5]][5]\r\n\r\n**If that `Caused by:`** DOESN&#39;T have a line with a blue text somewhere under it, then look for another `Caused by:` that does.\r\n\r\n**Click on that blue link**. It should take you to where the problem occurred. In my case, it was due to this line:\r\n\r\n    throw new RuntimeException();\r\n\r\nSo, now I know why it&#39;s crashing. It&#39;s because I&#39;m throwing the exception myself. **This was an obvious error**.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nHowever, let&#39;s say I got another error:\r\n\r\n    java.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\r\nI checked my logcat, I clicked on the blue link it gave me, and it took me here:\r\n\r\n    mTextView.setText(myString);\r\n\r\nSo, now I want to debug. According to [this StackOverflow question][6], a NullPointerException says that something is `null`.\r\n\r\nSo, let&#39;s find out **what is null**. There are two possibilities. Either `mTextView` is null, or `myString` is null. To find out, before the `mTextView.setText(mString)` line, I add these two lines:\r\n\r\n    Log.d(&quot;AppDebug&quot;,&quot;mTextView is null: &quot; + String.valueOf(mTextView == null);\r\n    Log.d(&quot;AppDebug&quot;,&quot;myString is null: &quot; + String.valueOf(myString== null);\r\n\r\nNow, like we did previously (We changed Verose to Error), we want to change &quot;Error&quot; to &quot;Debug&quot;. Since we&#39;re logging by debugging. Here are all the Log methods:\r\n\r\n    Log.\r\n      d means Debug\r\n      e means error\r\n      w means warning\r\n      v means verbose\r\n      i means information\r\n      wtf means &quot;What a terrible failure&quot;. This is similar to Log.e\r\n\r\nSo, since we used `Log.d`, we&#39;re checking in Debug. That&#39;s why we changed it to debug.\r\n\r\nNotice `Log.d` has a first parameter,in our case &quot;AppDebug&quot;. Click on the &quot;No Filters&quot; drop down menu on the top-right of the logcat. Select &quot;Edit Filter Configuration&quot;, give a name to your filter, and in &quot;Log Tag&quot; put &quot;App Debug&quot;. Click &quot;OK&quot;. Now, you should see two lines in the logcat:\r\n\r\n    yourPackageNameAndApp: mTextView is null: true\r\n    yourPackageNameAndApp: myString is null: false\r\n\r\nSo now we know that mTextView is null. \r\n\r\nI observe my code, now I notice something.\r\n\r\nI have `private TextView mTextView` declared at the top of my class. But, I&#39;m not defining it.\r\n\r\nBasically, I forgot to do this in my onCreate():\r\n\r\n    mTextView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textview_id_in_xml);\r\n\r\nSo THAT&#39;S why `mTextView` is null, because I forgot to tell my app what it is. So I add that line, run my app, and now the app doesn&#39;t crash.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/1hRMI.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/f71Qd.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/gpkIa.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/dmNaz.png\r\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/VC156.png\r\n  [6]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/218384/what-is-a-nullpointerexception-and-how-do-i-fix-it","title":"Unfortunately MyApp has stopped.

But I do not like that they directly inject an offset before parsing the date-time alone. I also do not like that they use `ZonedDateTime` where `OffsetDateTime` is more appropriate. \r\n\r\nApparently you have an input string with a date and a time-of-day but lacking the context of a time zone or offset from UTC. For example: `&quot;2023-01-23 15:30:55&quot;`. \r\n\r\n    String input = &quot;2023-01-23 15:30:55&quot; ; \r\n\r\nThat input nearly complies with the [ISO 8601][3] standard format for date-time values. To fully comply, swap that SPACE in the middle with a `T`.\r\n\r\n    String modified = input.replace( &quot; &quot; , &quot;T&quot; ) ;\r\n\r\nThe *java.time* classes use ISO 8601 formats by default when parsing/generating text. So no need to specify a formatting pattern. \r\n\r\nParse as a date-with-time object, an [`LocalDateTime`][4] object. \r\n\r\n    LocalDateTime ldt = LocalDateTime.parse( modified );\r\n\r\nYou said you want to assume that date and time is intended to represent a moment as seen with an offset from UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. Java offers a constant for that offset, [`ZoneOffset.UTC`][5]. Apply that `ZoneOffset` to produce an [`OffsetDateTime`][6] object. \r\n\r\n    OffsetDateTime odt = ldt.atOffset( ZoneOffset.UTC );\r\n\r\nNext you asked to adjust from that offset of zero to view the same moment in the JVM’s current default time zone. Same moment, same point on the timeline, but different wall-clock time.\r\n\r\nGet that default zone.\r\n\r\n    ZoneId z = ZoneId.systemDefault() ;\r\n\r\nApply that `ZoneId` to the `OffsetDateTime` to get a `ZonedDateTime`.\r\n\r\n    ZonedDateTime zdt = odt.atZoneSameInstant( z ) ;\r\n\r\nGenerate text in localized format.

for me</p>\n<p>The SBOMTest class defines a GenericContainer field named cyclonedxCli that is annotated with the @Rule annotation. This container is based on the cyclonedx/cyclonedx-cli Docker image, and it maps a classpath resource at /path/to/sboms to the path /app/sboms in the container.</p>\n<p>The testSBOMValidation method is a JUnit test that starts the cyclonedxCli container, runs the cyclonedx-cli validate command in the container to validate an SBOM file, and then stops the container.</p>\n<p>The test method uses the execInContainer method of the GenericContainer class to run the cyclonedx-cli command in the container, and it stores the command's output and exit code in the result variable.</p>\n<p>The test method then uses the assertThat method from the AssertJ library to assert that the command's exit code is zero.

Which would prefix the given string with <code>&quot;ROLE_&quot;</code> (which a default prefix for roles) and check if the prefixed string is present in the set of authorities extracted from the <code>Athentication</code>.</p>\n<p>So if you're storing your users in the database, authorities are being pull out from the DB at the stage of Authentication, not during Authorization, when <code>hasRole()</code> gets executed.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":15106683,"reputation":143,"user_id":10902172,"display_name":"yokus"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1343,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":74914256,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1672013089,"creation_date":1671977303,"question_id":74913765,"body_markdown":"I am building a rest API and set `sessionCreationPolicy` of `HttpSecurity` object as STATELESS in my `SecurityFilterChain` method.\r\n\r\nSince I could not find how does `hasRole()` method works internally, I wanted to try to see database access per requests which needs authorization.\r\n\r\nAfter modifying database config. file, I can test and see manual queries logged but still can not get a query log from my application &quot;check if this user has that role etc.&quot;.\r\n\r\nHere is overwritten `doFilterInternal()` method of `AuthTokenFilter` class, which we extend from `OncePerRequestFilter`.\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain)\r\n            throws ServletException, IOException {\r\n        try {\r\n            String jwt = parseJwt(request);\r\n            if (jwt != null &amp;&amp; jwtUtils.validateJwtToken(jwt)) {\r\n                String username = jwtUtils.getUserNameFromJwtToken(jwt);\r\n    \r\n                UserDetails userDetails = userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(username);\r\n                UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authentication = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(userDetails, null,\r\n                        userDetails.getAuthorities());\r\n                authentication.setDetails(new WebAuthenticationDetailsSource().buildDetails(request));\r\n    \r\n                SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication);\r\n            }\r\n        } catch (Exception e) {\r\n            logger.error(&quot;Cannot set user authentication: {}&quot;, e);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        filterChain.doFilter(request, response);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it possible something similar to session storage is used by spring security for authorization purpose, which seems impossible from the way we build `HttpSecurity`.","title":"How does Spring Security hasRole with PreAuthorize works under the hood?","body":"<p>I am building a rest API and set <code>sessionCreationPolicy</code> of <code>HttpSecurity</code> object as STATELESS in my <code>SecurityFilterChain</code> method.</p>\n<p>Since I could not find how does <code>hasRole()</code> method works internally, I wanted to try to see database access per requests which needs authorization.</p>\n<p>After modifying database config. file, I can test and see manual queries logged but still can not get a query log from my application &quot;check if this user has that role etc.&quot;.</p>\n<p>Here is overwritten <code>doFilterInternal()</code> method of <code>AuthTokenFilter</code> class, which we extend from <code>OncePerRequestFilter</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>@Override\nprotected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain)\n        throws ServletException, IOException {\n    try {\n        String jwt = parseJwt(request);\n        if (jwt != null &amp;&amp; jwtUtils.validateJwtToken(jwt)) {\n            String username = jwtUtils.getUserNameFromJwtToken(jwt);\n\n            UserDetails userDetails = userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername(username);\n            UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authentication = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(userDetails, null,\n                    userDetails.getAuthorities());\n            authentication.setDetails(new WebAuthenticationDetailsSource().buildDetails(request));\n\n            SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication);\n        }\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        logger.error(&quot;Cannot set user authentication: {}&quot;, e);\n    }\n\n    filterChain.doFilter(request, response);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is it possible something similar to session storage is used by spring security for authorization purpose, which seems impossible from the way we build <code>HttpSecurity</code>.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","sockets","serversocket","outputstream"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":85671,"reputation":40858,"user_id":238704,"display_name":"President James K.

You'll have to hardcode for each major OS the right location if you don't just want to 'write to <code>.myapp.bin</code> in the home dir of the user' which you can easily do via <code>System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;)</code>.</p>\n<p>So, yes, you are wrong on both points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DB/SQL is fine - there is no need to force the user to install a separate library. sqlite can do it (but this does involve DLLs and the like; sqlite JDBC driver takes care of this), but I'd recommend h2database.com for this purpose.</li>\n<li>It will be a file.

JUnit is not the only Java test framework. Concentrating on the technical details of using a framework however detracts from the most important concepts that should be guiding your actions,  so I will talk about those. \r\n\r\n* Testing (of all kinds of all kinds of things) compares the *actual* behaviour of something (The System Under Test, SUT) with its *expected* behaviour.\r\n\r\n* Automated testing can be done using a computer program. Because that comparison is being done by an inflexible and unintelligent computer program, the expected behaviour must be precisely and unambiguously known.\r\n\r\n* What a program or part of a program (a class or method)  is expected to do is its *specification*. Testing software therefore requires that you have a specification for the SUT. This might be an explicit description, or an implicit specification in your head of what is expected.\r\n\r\n* Automated unit testing therefore requires a precise and unambiguous specification of the class or method you are testing.\r\n\r\n* But you needed that specification when you set out to write that code. So part of what testing is about actually begins before you write even one line of the SUT. The testing technique of Test Driven Development (TDD) takes that idea to an extreme, and has you create the unit testing code before you write the code to be tested.\r\n\r\n* Unit testing frameworks test your SUT using *assertions*. An assertion is a logical expression (an expression with a `boolean` result type; a *predicate*) that must be `true` if the SUT is behaving correctly. The specification must therefore be expressed (or re-expressed) as assertions.\r\n\r\n* A useful technique for expressing a specification as assertions is *Design by Contract*. These specifications are in terms of *postconditions*. A postcondition is an assertion about the publicly visible state of the SUT after return from a method or a constructor. Some methods have postconditions \r\nthat are *invariants*, which are predicates that are true before and after execution of the method. A *class* can also be said to have invariants,  which are postconditions of every constructor and method of the class,  and hence should *always* be true. Postconditions (And invariants) are expressed only in terms of publicity visible state: `public` and `protected` fields, the values returned by returned by `public` and `protected` methods (such as getters), and the publicly visible state of objects passed (by reference) to methods.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMany beginners post questions here asking how they can test some code, presenting the code but without stating the specification for that code. As this discussion shows, it is impossible for *anyone* to give a good answer to such a question, because at best potential answereres must *guess* the specification, and might do so incorrectly. The *asker* of the question evidently does not understand the importance of a specification, and is thus a novice who needs to understand the fundamentals I&#39;ve described here *before* trying to write some test code.

Should I make my view static in stead, is that it?</p>\n<p>Instead of BorderPanes I am of course also okay with using Scenes, whatever works.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","hibernate","jpa","jpa-2.0"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1076053,"reputation":85188,"user_id":1281433,"accept_rate":43,"display_name":"Joshua Taylor"},"score":0,"creation_date":1443556970,"post_id":32852595,"comment_id":53539109,"body_markdown":"I&#39;ve posted [an answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/32852596/1281433) to this that worked for me, but I&#39;d be happy to have a more authoritative answer that explains the underlying issue.","body":"I&#39;ve posted <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/32852596/1281433\">an answer</a> to this that worked for me, but I&#39;d be happy to have a more authoritative answer that explains the underlying issue."}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":411863,"reputation":7400,"user_id":784594,"display_name":"OndroMih"},"score":1,"creation_date":1443620028,"post_id":32852596,"comment_id":53566959,"body_markdown":"Generally, entity class **DO NOT** need to be serializable, it is required only when they need to be passed to remote systems via RMI (calling a remote EJB).

Simply reset this image, ie: </p>\n\n<p><em>Floor class:</em> </p>\n\n<pre><code>public void clear() {\n    bufImage.flush();\n    bufImage = null;\n    repaint();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>FloorPlan class:</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>clearButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {\n    @Override\n    public void actionPerformed(final ActionEvent e) {\n        floor.clear();\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":27351471,"reputation":1,"user_id":20860582,"display_name":"Captured Gaming"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1671997269,"creation_date":1671997269,"answer_id":74915529,"question_id":14691733,"body_markdown":"You could use a for loop with panel.remove the buttons (instead of panel.add)","title":"How do I clear my Jpanel but keep the grid lines?","body":"<p>You could use a for loop with panel.remove the buttons (instead of panel.add)</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":2301899,"reputation":39,"user_id":2022044,"display_name":"odk"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1496,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":14736714,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1671997269,"creation_date":1359997740,"question_id":14691733,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m drawing lines on a JPanel using a paint component and graphics 2D, but the background of the JPanel is set to a grid which is drawn when the user enters some dimensions.

With the action event method for the clear button, I've tried using repaint(), removeAll() and creating a new instance of the JPanel but none of that seems to work. </p>\n\n<p>Here is the code for the class with the main Panel and button functions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package floorplan;\n\n/**\n*\n* @author xodkx\n*/\n\n\nimport java.awt.BorderLayout;\nimport java.awt.Color;\nimport
