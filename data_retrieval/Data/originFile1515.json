Any help would be great.</p>\n<pre><code>ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\n    Object  MSWorkbook = IDataUtil.get( pipelineCursor, &quot;MSWorkbook&quot; );\n    Workbook wb = (Workbook) MSWorkbook;\n    FileOutputStream fileOut;\n    \n    try {\n        fileOut = new FileOutputStream(&quot;/tmp/brad.xlsx&quot;);\n        wb.write(fileOut);\n        fileOut.close();\n    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n        // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    try {\n        wb.write(bos);\n        bos.close();\n    } catch( Exception e) {\n        \n    }\n    byte[] bytes = bos.toByteArray();\n    try{\n       OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(new File(&quot;/tmp/brad1.xlsx&quot;));\n       os.write(bytes);\n       os.close();\n    } catch (Exception e){}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","recursion","stack-overflow","maze"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":9463219,"reputation":9357,"user_id":7036419,"display_name":"Maurice Perry"},"score":0,"creation_date":1647352398,"post_id":71483379,"comment_id":126345748,"body_markdown":"The problem with your algorithm is that nothing prevents you from going back at a location already considered.","body":"The problem with your algorithm is that nothing prevents you from going back at a location already considered."},{"owner":{"account_id":19101591,"reputation":35,"user_id":13949747,"display_name":"SenorGeraldo"},"score":0,"creation_date":1647352529,"post_id":71483379,"comment_id":126345804,"body_markdown":"@MauricePerry the last condition of the if statement checks that the specific block value is 1 (2 is previously concidered)","body":"@MauricePerry the last condition of the if statement checks that the specific block value is 1 (2 is previously concidered)"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":223457,"reputation":4755,"user_id":482682,"accept_rate":95,"display_name":"Lrrr"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1647361519,"creation_date":1647361519,"answer_id":71485646,"question_id":71483379,"body_markdown":"The problem is in line 5 of your code.

Here a hack is applied for brevity: as both the inputs and the outputs are numbers, and `int` in particular, the intermediate storage can be `int[2]`, where the first element is the thing we are counting (so `0` and `1` in the example), and the second element is the counter. Later in the post there will be &quot;real&quot; something-counter pairs.\r\n\r\n    Stream&lt;Integer&gt; stream = Stream.of(0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1);\r\n\r\n    List&lt;Integer&gt; result = stream.collect(\r\n        ArrayList&lt;int[]&gt;::new,\r\n        (list, i) -&gt; {\r\n            if (list.isEmpty() || list.get(list.size() - 1)[0] != i)\r\n                list.add(new int[] { i, 1 });\r\n            else\r\n                list.get(list.size() - 1)[1]++;\r\n        },\r\n        (l1, l2) -&gt; {\r\n            if (l1.isEmpty() || l2.isEmpty() || l1.get(l1.size() - 1)[0] != l2.get(0)[0])\r\n                l1.addAll(l2);\r\n            else {\r\n                l1.get(l1.size() - 1)[1] += l2.get(0)[1];\r\n                l1.addAll(l2.subList(1, l2.size()));\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ).stream().map(pair -&gt; pair[1]).collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(result);\r\n\r\n`ArrayList&lt;int[]&gt;::new` is the supplier, it creates the intermediate storage(s) when needed. Similar to &quot;identity&quot; in `reduce()`, but it can be reused.\r\n\r\nThe accumulator function (the `(list, i)` thing) checks if the `list` is empty or its last element is counting something else than `i`, and in that case adds a new pair, initialized with `i` as element, and `1` as count. Otherwise it just increases the existing counter as it counts the same kind of element as `i`. `collect()` does mutable accumulation, and thus nothing is returned (unlike with `reduce()`).\r\n\r\nThen there is a &quot;combiner&quot; (the `(l1, l2)` thing), which has to be able to combine two partial results into one (into the first one of the two). Here we have to be prepared that a partial result may end with the beginning of the next partial result, that&#39;s what the `if` is checking: the two lists can be &quot;blindly&quot; appended if either of them is empty (unlikely, but who knows), or the last element of the first list is counting something else than the first element of the second list (here it&#39;s also handy that we already know that the lists are not empty, so those last/first elements exist). Otherwise we have to update the last element of the first list (with the counter of the first element in the second list), and only append the remaining elements.\r\n\r\nAnd as we have a list of `int[2]`s at this point, a separate `map`-`collect` pair strips them into the counter part which we want.\r\n\r\nThe printed output is `[3, 2, 2, 4]` by the way.\r\n\r\nHow such partial results and the need for combining them could arise? One possible case is that this thing can work in parallel. Here is a variant with some logging, and also with a &quot;proper&quot; pair object instead of `int[2]`.

Otherwise it just increases the existing counter as it counts the same kind of element as <code>i</code>. <code>collect()</code> does mutable accumulation, and thus nothing is returned (unlike with <code>reduce()</code>).</p>\n<p>Then there is a &quot;combiner&quot; (the <code>(l1, l2)</code> thing), which has to be able to combine two partial results into one (into the first one of the two). Here we have to be prepared that a partial result may end with the beginning of the next partial result, that's what the <code>if</code> is checking: the two lists can be &quot;blindly&quot; appended if either of them is empty (unlikely, but who knows), or the last element of the first list is counting something else than the first element of the second list (here it's also handy that we already know that the lists are not empty, so those last/first elements exist).

E.g.</p>\n\n<pre>\npublic static void moveToFront(final JInternalFrame fr) {\n        if (fr != null) {\n            processOnSwingEventThread(new Runnable() {\n                public void run() {\n                    fr.moveToFront();\n                    fr.setVisible(true);\n                    try {\n                        fr.setSelected(true);\n                        if (fr.isIcon()) {\n                            fr.setIcon(false);\n                        }\n                        fr.setSelected(true);\n                    } catch (PropertyVetoException ex) {\n                        ex.printStackTrace();\n                    }\n                    fr.requestFocus();\n                    fr.toFront();\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    }\n</pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","solr","solrj"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":4469374,"reputation":8528,"user_id":3636071,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Abhijit Bashetti"},"score":1,"creation_date":1647358116,"post_id":71476774,"comment_id":126348294,"body_markdown":"you can try with Update request Preocessors from solr....https://solr.apache.org/guide/7_6/update-request-processors.html","body":"you can try with Update request Preocessors from solr....<a href=\"https://solr.apache.org/guide/7_6/update-request-processors.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">solr.apache.org/guide/7_6/update-request-processors.&zwnj;&#8203;html</a>"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4469374,"reputation":8528,"user_id":3636071,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Abhijit Bashetti"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1647358823,"creation_date":1647358310,"answer_id":71484876,"question_id":71476774,"body_markdown":"You can archive the same with the help of Update request Processors of Solr\r\n\r\nYou can use the `ConcatFieldUpdateProcessorFactory` :\r\n\r\n&gt; Concatenates multiple values for fields matching the specified\r\n&gt; conditions using a configurable delimiter.\r\n\r\nFor Example : \r\n\r\n\r\n1.

An easy way to do this is by using the Java Streams API.\r\n```\r\nwords = Stream.of(words).sorted().toArray(String[]::new);\r\n```\r\nHowever, for this specific assignment, the OP stated that a `while` loop must be used exclusively. Therefore, using only `while` loop:\r\n```\r\nint i = 0;\r\nwhile (i &lt; words.length - 1) {\r\n\r\n    // Checking the condition for two\r\n    // adjacent words of the array\r\n    if (words[i].compareTo(words[i + 1]) &gt; 0) {\r\n\r\n        // Swapping the elements if the next word\r\n        // precedes the current alphabetically\r\n        String temp = words[i];\r\n        words[i] = words[i + 1];\r\n        words[i + 1] = temp;\r\n\r\n        // we must keep resetting the index back to zero\r\n        // when a sort occurs\r\n        i = -1;\r\n    }\r\n    i++;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is obviously not the most optimized loop, but for academic purposes is clear enough to understand. Using the following sentence as an example (using all lowercase letters for simplicity):\r\n```\r\nthe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\r\n```\r\nSorted alphabetically should result in\r\n```\r\n[ brown, dog, fox, jumps, lazy, over, quick, the, the ]\r\n```\r\nGoing over the first few iterations:\r\n\r\n 1. In the first iteration, the words &quot;the&quot; and &quot;quick&quot; get swapped and the index *i* is reset back to zero.\r\n 2. In the second iteration, (*i* equals zero again), the words &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;the&quot; are in correct order with respect to each other. They are not swapped and the index is incremented by one.\r\n 3. In the third iteration (*i*  equals to 1), the words &quot;the&quot; and &quot;brown&quot; are swapped and the index is reset back to zero.\r\n 4. In the fourth iteration, (*i* equals zero again), the words &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;brown&quot; are sorted and the index is reset back to zero.\r\n\r\nAfter 4 iterations, the array is partially sorted:\r\n```\r\n[ brown, quick, the, fox, jumps, over, the, lazy, dog ]\r\n```\r\nThe process continues until all the words that precede their previous neighbor &quot;bubble up&quot; to the surface. Eventually, all the words will be sorted, the index will be equal to the word count, and the process will stop. For the sentence I provided, it takes 90 iterations for the sorting to complete. This value is not relative to the size of the array. The number of iteration depend on other factors as well\r\n\r\nPutting it all together, the solution looks like this:\r\n```\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Enter a sentence:&quot;);\r\n    String sentence = scanner.nextLine();\r\n    String[] words = sentence.toLowerCase().split(&quot;\\\\s&quot;);\r\n    if (words.length &lt; 2) {\r\n        System.err.println(&quot;Not enough words were entered&quot;);\r\n        System.exit(-1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    int i = 0;\r\n    while (i &lt; words.length - 1) {\r\n        if (words[i].compareTo(words[i + 1]) &gt; 0) {\r\n            String temp = words[i];\r\n            words[i] = words[i + 1];\r\n            words[i + 1] = temp;\r\n            i = -1;\r\n        }\r\n        i++;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;The second word is: &quot; + words[1]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFor the sentence I used in this example, the output prints out\r\n```\r\ndog\r\n```\r\n----------\r\n**Based on this new information:**\r\n\r\n&gt; *Write a program, that inputs words from the user, until the user enters ‘exit’. When the user enters ‘exit’ the program should display the word that comes second alphabetically. Your program should not be case sensitive.*\r\n\r\nThe solution will prompt the user in a loop (using `while` loop as a given constraint).\r\n```\r\nString input = &quot;&quot;;\r\nScanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\r\nList&lt;String&gt; words = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\nboolean isExit = false;\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;For this problem, you must enter at least two words.&quot;);\r\nwhile (!isExit) {\r\n\tSystem.out.print(&quot;Enter a word (type \\&quot;exit\\&quot; to finish): &quot;);\r\n\tinput = scanner.next();\r\n\tisExit = &quot;exit&quot;.equalsIgnoreCase(input);\r\n\tif (!isExit) {\r\n\t\twords.add(input.toLowerCase());\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\nscanner.close();\r\n```\r\nThe code snippet above does a couple, necessary, things:\r\n\r\n 1. Uses `ArrayList` rather than an array to allow unbounded growth of the collection. &quot;Resizing&quot; an array is a much costlier process than using this Java specialized class.\r\n 2. Checks if the word entered is &quot;exit&quot; which is the special-case input to terminate the loop. It is not, and should not, part of the words to be evaluated.\r\n\r\nOnce the loop operation concludes, the rest of the code should be pretty much the same. We must evaluate the collection of words and check which is the second word in alphabetical order. For this, all we need to do is sort the collection and return whichever word is at index 1. Since I already provided a looping solution to sort the array, I will show better ways to sort a collection. Of course, the easiest way is calling `Collections#sort()`\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (words.size() &lt; 2) {\r\n\tSystem.err.println(&quot;Not enough words were entered&quot;);\r\n\tSystem.exit(-1);\r\n}\r\nCollections.sort(words);\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Second word in alphabetical order: &quot; + words.get(1));\r\n```\r\nThe caveat with `Collections#sort()` is that the operation modifies the given list. This may or may not be desirable. There might be cases when the original list must be preserved. For those cases, we can use another Java standard library approach using `Streams` API:\r\n```\r\nList&lt;String&gt; sortedWords = words.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.toList());\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Second word in alphabetical order: &quot; + sortedWords.get(1));\r\n```\r\nUsing the same words I used in my previous version, the result is the same (as expected)\r\n```\r\nEnter a word (type &quot;exit&quot; to finish): the\r\nEnter a word (type &quot;exit&quot; to finish): quick\r\nEnter a word (type &quot;exit&quot; to finish): brown\r\nEnter a word (type &quot;exit&quot; to finish): fox\r\nEnter a word (type &quot;exit&quot; to finish): jumps\r\nEnter a word (type &quot;exit&quot; to finish): over\r\nEnter a word (type &quot;exit&quot; to finish): the\r\nEnter a word (type &quot;exit&quot; to finish): lazy\r\nEnter a word (type &quot;exit&quot; to finish): dog\r\nEnter a word (type &quot;exit&quot; to finish): exit\r\nSecond word in alphabetical order: dog\r\n```","title":"How to print second word alphabetically ? | JAVA","body":"<p>Use <code>Scanner#nextLine()</code> to capture many space-delimited characters and then split the input into an array of words using <code>String#split(String)</code> method.</p>\n<pre><code>Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Enter a sentence:&quot;);\nString sentence = scanner.nextLine();\nString[] words = sentence.split(&quot;\\\\s&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since the words need to be sorted (the question asks for &quot;<em>the second word that comes in alphabetical order</em>&quot;, we can use various methods.

This way you are controlling the parent width manully and the contents width is handled by binding.\r\n\r\nThe code in the TestPanel will be:\r\n\r\n    private DoubleProperty size = new SimpleDoubleProperty();\r\n    \r\n    double padding = 4; // 2px on either side\r\n    viewportBoundsProperty().addListener((obs, old, bounds) -&gt; {\r\n        size.setValue((bounds.getWidth() - padding - ((ROW_MAX - 1) * SPACING)) / ROW_MAX);\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    CustomBox box = new CustomBox(item);\r\n    box.minWidthProperty().bind(size);\r\n\r\nA complete working demo is below:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n    import javafx.application.Application;\r\n    import javafx.beans.property.DoubleProperty;\r\n    import javafx.beans.property.SimpleDoubleProperty;\r\n    import javafx.geometry.Insets;\r\n    import javafx.scene.Scene;\r\n    import javafx.scene.control.ScrollPane;\r\n    import javafx.scene.layout.HBox;\r\n    import javafx.scene.layout.Priority;\r\n    import javafx.scene.layout.StackPane;\r\n    import javafx.scene.layout.VBox;\r\n    import javafx.scene.paint.Color;\r\n    import javafx.scene.shape.Rectangle;\r\n    import javafx.stage.Stage;\r\n    \r\n    import java.util.ArrayList;\r\n    import java.util.List;\r\n    import java.util.stream.IntStream;\r\n    \r\n    public class ScrollPaneContentDemo extends Application {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {\r\n            List&lt;Item&gt; items = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n            IntStream.range(1, 1000).forEach(i -&gt; items.add(new Item()));\r\n            TestPanel root = new TestPanel(items);\r\n            Scene scene = new Scene(root, 500, 500);\r\n            stage.setScene(scene);\r\n            stage.setTitle(&quot;ScrollPaneContent Demo&quot;);\r\n            stage.show();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        class TestPanel extends ScrollPane {\r\n            private final int SPACING = 5;\r\n            private final int ROW_MAX = 6;\r\n            private DoubleProperty size = new SimpleDoubleProperty();\r\n    \r\n            public TestPanel(List&lt;Item&gt; items) {\r\n                final VBox root = new VBox();\r\n                root.setSpacing(SPACING);\r\n                HBox row = null;\r\n                int count = 0;\r\n                for (Item item : items) {\r\n                    if (count == ROW_MAX || row == null) {\r\n                        row = new HBox();\r\n                        row.setSpacing(SPACING);\r\n                        root.getChildren().add(row);\r\n                        count = 0;\r\n                    }\r\n    \r\n                    CustomBox box = new CustomBox(item);\r\n                    box.minWidthProperty().bind(size);\r\n                    row.getChildren().add(box);\r\n                    HBox.setHgrow(box, Priority.ALWAYS);\r\n                    count++;\r\n                }\r\n                setFitToWidth(true);\r\n                setContent(root);\r\n    \r\n                double padding = 4;\r\n                viewportBoundsProperty().addListener((obs, old, bounds) -&gt; {\r\n                    size.setValue((bounds.getWidth() - padding - ((ROW_MAX - 1) * SPACING)) / ROW_MAX);\r\n                });\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        class CustomBox extends StackPane {\r\n            private Item item;\r\n            private Rectangle square;\r\n            private int size = 20;\r\n    \r\n            public CustomBox(Item item) {\r\n                setStyle(&quot;-fx-background-color:#99999950;&quot;);\r\n                this.item = item;\r\n                setPadding(new Insets(5, 5, 5, 5));\r\n                square = new Rectangle(size, size, Color.RED);\r\n                square.widthProperty().bind(widthProperty());\r\n                square.heightProperty().bind(heightProperty());\r\n    \r\n                maxHeightProperty().bind(minWidthProperty());\r\n                maxWidthProperty().bind(minWidthProperty());\r\n                minHeightProperty().bind(minWidthProperty());\r\n                getChildren().add(square);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        class Item {\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/aKtvq.gif","title":"JavaFX setHgrow / binding property expanding infinitely","body":"<p>I believe the root cause for your problem lies at: the <code>square</code> width binding with <code>CustomBox</code> width.

Create a `String` array with the header values using the value from #1 to determine how many relative name and id columns to put. Once that is done create a `List&lt;String []&gt;` and put the array in the list. \r\n3. Create a helper class to convert a `User` into a `String` array.  Pass in the value from #1 so if you have fewer relatives than max you can pad with empty strings or null (your choice). Using this loop through the list of user objects converting each user to an array of strings and add that array to the the list created in #2. \r\n4.

And then run your code with those examples and see what happens."},{"owner":{"account_id":551394,"reputation":8315,"user_id":916225,"accept_rate":69,"display_name":"seenukarthi"},"score":1,"creation_date":1647350301,"post_id":71482804,"comment_id":126344808,"body_markdown":"You are comparing the index instead of the value in that index also you have the condition backward and it should be in single if like `data[i] &gt; low &amp;&amp; data[i] &lt; high`.","body":"You are comparing the index instead of the value in that index also you have the condition backward and it should be in single if like <code>data[i] &gt; low &amp;&amp; data[i] &lt; high</code>."}],"owner":{"account_id":22598648,"reputation":1,"user_id":16780551,"display_name":"Nick"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":176,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1647349991,"creation_date":1647349699,"question_id":71482804,"body_markdown":"Trying to understand this question a bit more.
