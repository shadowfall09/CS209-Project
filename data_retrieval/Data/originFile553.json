I also tried by adding <code>adapter.notifyItemChanged(adapterPosition)</code> thinking that maybe it didn't work because the adapter wasn't being notified of the change, but the issue persists. Why is <code>getBindingAdapterPosition()</code> returning -1 only on SOME items and how can I solve this? Is there another method I can use or is there something I am doing wrong without noticing?</p>\n<p>Here is the <code>MyViewHolder</code> in my RecyclerViewAdapter class:</p>\n<pre><code>public static class MyViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder implements View.OnClickListener\n{\n    TextView textView;\n    OnItemListener onItemListener;\n    ArrayList&lt;Task&gt; list;\n    private final RecyclerViewAdapter adapter;\n\n    MyViewHolder(@NonNull View itemView, OnItemListener onItemListener, ArrayList&lt;Task&gt; list, RecyclerViewAdapter adapter) {\n        super(itemView);\n\n        textView = itemView.findViewById(R.id.singleView);\n        this.onItemListener = onItemListener;\n        this.list = list;\n        this.adapter = adapter;\n\n        itemView.setOnClickListener(this);\n        itemView.setOnLongClickListener(view -&gt; {\n            onLongClick();\n            return true;\n        });\n    }\n\n    private void onLongClick(int position)\n    {\n        // Handles the long click event on an item in the RecyclerView,\n        // opens a Dialog with an EditText with the name of the task to edit the task name.\n\n        String text = textView.getText().toString();\n        // Creates the EditText for user input and style the look and behavior of it.\n        final EditText input = new EditText(itemView.getContext());\n        input.setBackground(ContextCompat.getDrawable(itemView.getContext(), R.drawable.edit_text_dialog));\n        input.setTextColor(ContextCompat.getColor(itemView.getContext(), R.color.colorText));\n        input.setText(text);\n        input.setSingleLine();\n        input.setImeOptions(EditorInfo.IME_ACTION_SEND);\n        input.setPadding(28, 28, 28, 28);\n\n        // Create an AlertDialog for the user to edit the task name.\n        AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(itemView.getContext(), R.style.DialogTheme);\n        builder.setTitle(R.string.dialog_edit_title)\n                .setMessage(R.string.dialog_edit_message)\n                .setView(input)\n                .setPositiveButton(R.string.dialog_edit_positive_button, (dialogInterface, i) -&gt;\n                {\n                    // When the positive button is clicked, save the edited task name.\n                    String editedText = input.getText().toString();\n                    if (!editedText.isEmpty())\n                    {\n                    saveEditedTaskName(itemView.getContext(), editedText, position);\n                    }\n                })\n                .setNegativeButton(R.string.dialog_edit_negative_button, (dialogInterface, i) -&gt; dialogInterface.cancel());\n        // Show the AlertDialog.\n        AlertDialog dialog = builder.show();\n\n        input.setOnEditorActionListener((textView, actionId, keyEvent) -&gt;\n        {\n            // Set the listener for the send button on the EditText.\n            if (actionId == EditorInfo.IME_ACTION_SEND)\n            {\n                // When the send button is clicked, save the edited task name and dismiss the dialog.\n                String editedText = input.getText().toString();\n                if (!editedText.isEmpty())\n                {\n                    saveEditedTaskName(itemView.getContext(), editedText, position);\n                }\n                dialog.dismiss();\n                return true;\n            }\n            return false;\n        });\n    }\n\n    private void saveEditedTaskName(Context mContext, String editedText)\n    {\n        // Method to save the edited task name.\n\n        SharedPreferences sharedPrefs = mContext.getSharedPreferences(MainActivity.SHARED_PREFS, 0);\n        String categoryId = sharedPrefs.getString(MainActivity.CATEGORY_ID_CHOICE, &quot;&quot;);\n\n        FirebaseHelper firebaseHelper = new FirebaseHelper();\n\n        int adapterPosition = getBindingAdapterPosition();\n        if (adapterPosition != RecyclerView.NO_POSITION)\n        {\n            // Problem here!\n            Task task = list.get(getBindingAdapterPosition());\n            String taskId = task.getTaskId();\n\n            DatabaseReference databaseReference = firebaseHelper.getDatabaseReference();\n            databaseReference.child(categoryId).child(DatabaseNodes.TASKS)\n                    .child(taskId).child(DatabaseNodes.TASK_NAME).setValue(editedText);\n\n            if (adapter != null)\n            {\n                adapter.notifyItemChanged(adapterPosition);\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Toast.makeText(mContext, &quot;An error occurred.

Don't know if this matters but thought that i'd share it, seems very odd...</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> After further testing, it seems like it's not only those two positions making trouble, if I have more items it can occur later aswell if the list is longer, but as stated earlier, somewhere usually around the same positions, indexes, 6,7,8.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","rest","jersey","glassfish","jersey-client"],"owner":{"account_id":6655944,"reputation":13,"user_id":5136505,"display_name":"sahil rana"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":65,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1679590276,"creation_date":1679590276,"question_id":75825857,"body_markdown":"using Java code that connects to the API gateway to make a post call.

I am using Java 11, and my problem is in the handle person functions, the code of the PersonExample is already working and its ok. final String request is a JSON that will be converted to a JAVA object that contains an T[] with elements of person1, or person2, or person3, so yeah, request can have different types of person in. The handlefunction already accepts every kind of person, but the problem is that I have different endpoints that are the same and call handlePerson1, 2 etc. and that functions are the same, the difference is the &lt;T&gt; classtype."},{"owner":{"account_id":329814,"reputation":11000,"user_id":653539,"accept_rate":50,"display_name":"Tom&#225;š Z&#225;lusk&#253;"},"score":0,"creation_date":1679673930,"post_id":75825328,"comment_id":133768947,"body_markdown":"Please show more code.

If you have any documentation from MS or otherwise that would be awesome although not the crux of the question.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  I discovered that the Windows 7 Play-to functionality is based on DLNA and any device supporting DLNA (I think) can be used as a destination for the Play-To context menu.  However, I'm having a really difficult time finding any sort of documentation on DLNA.  I'm wondering if you need to be a member of the DNLA to actually get access to the spec?
