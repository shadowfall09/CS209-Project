This makes clear that Java arrays are objects.  The class of these objects is defined in 10.8.\r\n\r\nSection 8.4.1 of the language spec, http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se5.0/html/classes.html#40420 , describe how arguments are passed to methods.  Since Java syntax is derived from C and C++, the behavior is similar.  Primitive types are passed by value, as with C.  When an object is passed, an object reference (pointer) is passed by value, mirroring the C syntax of passing a pointer by value.  See 4.3.1, http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se5.0/html/typesValues.html#4.3 ,\r\n\r\nIn practical terms, this means that modifying the contents of an array within a method is reflected in the array object in the calling scope, but reassigning a new value to the reference within the method has no effect on the reference in the calling scope, which is exactly the behavior you would expect of a pointer to a struct in C or an object in C++.\r\n\r\nAt least part of the confusion in terminology stems from the history of high level languages prior to the common use of C. In prior, popular, high level languages, directly referencing memory by address was something to be avoided to the extent possible, and it was considered the job of the language to provide a layer of abstraction.  This made it necessary for the language to explicitly support a mechanism for returning values from subroutines (not necessarily functions).  This mechanism is what is formally meant when referring to &#39;pass by reference&#39;.\r\n\r\nWhen C was introduced, it came with a stripped down notion of procedure calling, where all arguments are input-only, and the only value returned to the caller is a function result.  However, the purpose of passing references could be achieved through the explicit and broad use of pointers.  Since it serves the same purpose, the practice of passing a pointer as a reference to a value is often colloquially referred to a passing by reference.  If the **semantics** of a routine call for a parameter to be passed by reference, the **syntax** of C requires the programmer to explicitly pass a pointer.  Passing a pointer by value is the **design pattern** for implementing pass by reference semantics in C.\r\n\r\nSince it can often seem like the sole purpose of raw pointers in C is to create crashing bugs, subsequent developments, especially Java, have sought to return to safer means to pass parameters.  However, the dominance of C made it incumbent on the developers to mimic the familiar style of C coding.

This makes clear that Java arrays are objects.  The class of these objects is defined in 10.8.</p>\n\n<p>Section 8.4.1 of the language spec, <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se5.0/html/classes.html#40420\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se5.0/html/classes.html#40420</a> , describe how arguments are passed to methods.  Since Java syntax is derived from C and C++, the behavior is similar.  Primitive types are passed by value, as with C.  When an object is passed, an object reference (pointer) is passed by value, mirroring the C syntax of passing a pointer by value.  See 4.3.1, <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se5.0/html/typesValues.html#4.3\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se5.0/html/typesValues.html#4.3</a> ,</p>\n\n<p>In practical terms, this means that modifying the contents of an array within a method is reflected in the array object in the calling scope, but reassigning a new value to the reference within the method has no effect on the reference in the calling scope, which is exactly the behavior you would expect of a pointer to a struct in C or an object in C++.</p>\n\n<p>At least part of the confusion in terminology stems from the history of high level languages prior to the common use of C. In prior, popular, high level languages, directly referencing memory by address was something to be avoided to the extent possible, and it was considered the job of the language to provide a layer of abstraction.  This made it necessary for the language to explicitly support a mechanism for returning values from subroutines (not necessarily functions).  This mechanism is what is formally meant when referring to 'pass by reference'.</p>\n\n<p>When C was introduced, it came with a stripped down notion of procedure calling, where all arguments are input-only, and the only value returned to the caller is a function result.  However, the purpose of passing references could be achieved through the explicit and broad use of pointers.  Since it serves the same purpose, the practice of passing a pointer as a reference to a value is often colloquially referred to a passing by reference.  If the <strong>semantics</strong> of a routine call for a parameter to be passed by reference, the <strong>syntax</strong> of C requires the programmer to explicitly pass a pointer.  Passing a pointer by value is the <strong>design pattern</strong> for implementing pass by reference semantics in C.</p>\n\n<p>Since it can often seem like the sole purpose of raw pointers in C is to create crashing bugs, subsequent developments, especially Java, have sought to return to safer means to pass parameters.  However, the dominance of C made it incumbent on the developers to mimic the familiar style of C coding.  The result is references that are passed similarly to pointers, but are implemented with more protections to make them safer.  An alternative would have been the rich syntax of a language like Ada, but this would have presented the appearance of an unwelcome learning curve, and lessened the likely adoption of Java.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the design of parameter passing for objects, including arrays, in Java,is esentially to serve the <strong>semantic</strong> intent of pass by reference, but is imlemented with the <strong>syntax</strong> of passing a reference by value.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1583864,"reputation":2977,"user_id":1468643,"accept_rate":78,"display_name":"Froskoy"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":286455,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":245,"closed_date":1608092686,"accepted_answer_id":12757868,"answer_count":7,"score":243,"last_activity_date":1688032273,"creation_date":1349509455,"question_id":12757841,"body_markdown":"Arrays are not a [primitive type](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html) in Java, but they [are not objects either](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5564423/arrays-in-java-and-how-they-are-stored-in-memory), so are they passed by value or by reference?

It means that when a class implements such an interface, the methods defined as static do not require an instance to access / call them and they rather can be called on the class itself like  `class_name=&gt;interface_name~static_method_name`.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of declaring a method as static in an interface definition is actually to *create an agreement* that a particular *method will not depend on an instance* to work.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, also `PUBLIC` and `DEFAULT` keywords which might be used inside interface definition and which could at first lead to a confusion.\r\n\r\nInterface definition looks like:\r\n```\r\nINTERFACE intf [PUBLIC].\r\n    [components]\r\nENDINTERFACE.\r\n```\r\nAddition `PUBLIC` makes the interface a global interface of the class library and can only be used for the global interface of an interface pool and is created by class builder when a global interface is created.\r\n\r\nKeyword [`DEFAULT`][1] is available since [Release 7.40, SP08][2]\r\n\r\n```\r\nMETHODS meth [ABSTRACT|FINAL] | [DEFAULT IGNORE|FAIL] ...\r\nCLASS-METHODS meth [DEFAULT IGNORE|FAIL] ...\r\n```\r\nThe addition `DEFAULT` of the statements `METHODS` and `CLASS-METHODS` can be used to make these methods **optional**. An optional interface method **does not need to be implemented** explicitly in a class when an interface is implemented. Instead, a default behavior is specified for calls of non-implemented methods in the definition:\r\n- `DEFAULT IGNORE` - the behavior is the same as when it is implemented with an empty body\r\n- `DEFAULT FAIL` - raise an exception of the class `CX_SY_DYN_CALL_ILLEGAL_METHOD`\r\n\r\n  in case if not handled, the runtime error `CALL_METHOD_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` is raised\r\n\r\nYou can, of course, employ the inheritance to have a basic methods&#39; implementations, creating a (abstract) class with implemented methods and if necessary reimplement / override them in subclasses (keyword METHODS ..

The last problem, if we want a string with a certain length, random could generate a small number, so the length is not met, so we have to pad the string to its required length prepending zeros.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2496,"reputation":266244,"user_id":3474,"accept_rate":83,"display_name":"erickson"},"score":0,"creation_date":1622872051,"post_id":38776878,"comment_id":119921112,"body_markdown":"What does this answer add to the others already given?","body":"What does this answer add to the others already given?"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"display_name":"user5138430"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1498643388,"creation_date":1470342497,"answer_id":38776878,"question_id":41107,"body_markdown":"Maybe this is helpful\r\n\r\n    package password.generater;\r\n     \r\n    import java.util.Random;\r\n     \r\n    /**\r\n     *\r\n     * @author dell\r\n     */\r\n    public class PasswordGenerater {\r\n     \r\n        /**\r\n         * @param args the command line arguments\r\n         */\r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            int length= 11;\r\n            System.out.println(generatePswd(length));\r\n             \r\n            // TODO code application logic here\r\n        }\r\n        static char[] generatePswd(int len){\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Your Password &quot;);\r\n            String charsCaps=&quot;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&quot;; \r\n            String Chars=&quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;;\r\n            String nums=&quot;0123456789&quot;;\r\n            String symbols=&quot;!@#$%^&amp;*()_+-=.,/&#39;;:?&gt;&lt;~*/-+&quot;;\r\n            String passSymbols=charsCaps + Chars + nums +symbols;\r\n            Random rnd=new Random();\r\n            char[] password=new char[len];\r\n\r\n            for(int i=0; i&lt;len;i++){\r\n                password[i]=passSymbols.charAt(rnd.nextInt(passSymbols.length()));\r\n            }\r\n          return password;\r\n             \r\n        }\r\n    }","title":"How to generate a random alpha-numeric string","body":"<p>Maybe this is helpful</p>\n\n<pre><code>package password.generater;\n\nimport java.util.Random;\n\n/**\n *\n * @author dell\n */\npublic class PasswordGenerater {\n\n    /**\n     * @param args the command line arguments\n     */\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int length= 11;\n        System.out.println(generatePswd(length));\n\n        // TODO code application logic here\n    }\n    static char[] generatePswd(int len){\n        System.out.println(\"Your Password \");\n        String charsCaps=\"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"; \n        String Chars=\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\";\n        String nums=\"0123456789\";\n        String symbols=\"!@#$%^&amp;*()_+-=.,/';:?&gt;&lt;~*/-+\";\n        String passSymbols=charsCaps + Chars + nums +symbols;\n        Random rnd=new Random();\n        char[] password=new char[len];\n\n        for(int i=0; i&lt;len;i++){\n            password[i]=passSymbols.charAt(rnd.nextInt(passSymbols.length()));\n        }\n      return password;\n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4120139,"reputation":1,"user_id":3380739,"display_name":"user_3380739"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":false,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1673926652,"creation_date":1480364745,"answer_id":40852832,"question_id":41107,"body_markdown":"Here is the one-liner by [abacus-common][1]:\r\n\r\n    String.valueOf(CharStream.random(&#39;0&#39;, &#39;z&#39;).filter(c -&gt; N.isLetterOrDigit(c)).limit(12).toArray())\r\n\r\nRandom doesn&#39;t mean it must be unique.

Cryptographic Pseudo Random Data Generation (PRNG)\r\n\r\nFirst you need a cryptographic PRNG.

Required Space of Possible Values\r\n\r\nNext you have to decide &quot;how unique&quot; your token needs to be. The whole and only point of considering entropy is to make sure that the system can resist brute force attacks: the space of possible values must be so large that any attacker could only try a negligible proportion of the values in non-ludicrous time&lt;sup&gt;[1][3]&lt;/sup&gt;.\r\n\r\nUnique identifiers such as random [`UUID`][4] have 122 bits of entropy (i.e., 2^122 = 5.3x10^36) - the chance of collision is &quot;*(...) for there to be a one in a billion chance of duplication, 103 trillion version 4 UUIDs must be generated&lt;sup&gt;[2][5]&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;. **We will choose 128 bits since it fits exactly into 16 bytes** and is seen as [highly sufficient][6] for being unique for basically every, but the most extreme, use cases, and you don&#39;t have to think about duplicates.

The last thing is to think about encoding, so it can be represented as a printable text (read, a `String`).\r\n\r\n# 3. Binary to Text Encoding\r\n\r\nTypical encodings include:\r\n\r\n* [`Base64`][9] every character encodes 6 bits, creating a 33% overhead. Fortunately there are standard implementations in [Java 8+][10] and [Android][11]. With older Java you can use any of the [numerous third-party libraries][12]. If you want your tokens to be URL safe use the [URL-safe][13] version of RFC4648 (which usually is supported by most implementations). Example encoding 16 bytes with padding: `XfJhfv3C0P6ag7y9VQxSbw==`\r\n\r\n* [`Base32`][14] every character encodes 5 bits, creating a 40% overhead. This will use `A-Z` and `2-7`, making it reasonably space efficient while being case-insensitive alphanumeric. There isn&#39;t any [standard implementation in the JDK][15]. Example encoding 16 bytes without padding: `WUPIL5DQTZGMF4D3NX5L7LNFOY`\r\n\r\n* [`Base16`][16] (hexadecimal) every character encodes four bits, requiring two characters per byte (i.e., 16 bytes create a string of length 32). Therefore, hexadecimal is less space efficient than `Base32`, but it is safe to use in most cases (URL) since it only uses `0-9` and `A` to `F`. Example encoding 16 bytes: `4fa3dd0f57cb3bf331441ed285b27735`. [See a Stack&amp;nbsp;Overflow discussion about converting to hexadecimal here][17].\r\n\r\nAdditional encodings like [Base85][18] and the exotic [Base122][19] exist with better/worse space efficiency. You can create your own encoding (which basically most answers in this thread do), but I would advise against it, if you don&#39;t have very specific requirements. See [more encoding schemes in the Wikipedia article][20].\r\n\r\n# 4.

Example encoding 16 bytes: <code>4fa3dd0f57cb3bf331441ed285b27735</code>. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58118078/774398\">See a Stack Overflow discussion about converting to hexadecimal here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional encodings like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii85#RFC_1924_version\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Base85</a> and the exotic <a href=\"http://blog.kevinalbs.com/base122\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Base122</a> exist with better/worse space efficiency. You can create your own encoding (which basically most answers in this thread do), but I would advise against it, if you don't have very specific requirements.
