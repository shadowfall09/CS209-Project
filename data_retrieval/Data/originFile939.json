But so far it doesn't bother me much.</p>\n<p>Problems arise when I want to add some logic to <code>AbstractEntityService</code> which requires some other beans, i.e. something like this</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-kotlin prettyprint-override\"><code>@Service\nabstract class AbstractEntityService&lt;T&gt;(\n  private val entityRepository: AbstractRepository&lt;T&gt;,\n) {\n  \n  @Autowired\n  private lateinit var otherService: OtherService\n\n  fun getEntity(entityId: Long): T\n\n  fun commonMethodUsingOtherService(): T\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>But now I have a problem because in order to autowire <code>OtherService</code> I had to make my abstract service a Spring component (<code>@Service</code>) which has an unwanted side effect of Spring trying to inject <code>AbstractRepository&lt;T&gt;</code> declared in my constructor. And because of the above mentioned type erasure it finds lots of beans of <code>AbstractRepository</code> type and fails.</p>\n<p><strong>My question</strong>: How can I convince Spring to not inject a bean into my <code>AbstractEntityService</code> constructor?</p>\n<p><strong>Related question</strong>: Is there a technically different solution to my problem (mentioned in the first paragraph) which avoids possible framework restrictions/shortcomings? I.e. not using inheritance, structuring my code differently etc.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","spring-boot","validation","spring-data-jpa"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":7925138,"reputation":114,"user_id":5984784,"display_name":"toowboga"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1666597896,"creation_date":1666597896,"answer_id":74178025,"question_id":74143917,"body_markdown":"If you want to validate two fields of a class, you have to use a custom validator with a class level constraint and then compare both values in the validator class.  \r\n\r\nCheck this [answer][1] for more information.\r\n\r\nAnother solution is to define a method that must validate to true and put the `@AssertTrue` annotation on the top of it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@AssertTrue\r\nprivate boolean isEqual() {\r\n    return userpassword.equals(confirmPassword);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/2783859/5984784","title":"Spring Boot JPA Custom validation null point error for password confirmation","body":"<p>If you want to validate two fields of a class, you have to use a custom validator with a class level constraint and then compare both values in the validator class.</p>\n<p>Check this <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/2783859/5984784\">answer</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>Another solution is to define a method that must validate to true and put the <code>@AssertTrue</code> annotation on the top of it:</p>\n<pre><code>@AssertTrue\nprivate boolean isEqual() {\n    return userpassword.equals(confirmPassword);\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":12848624,"reputation":15,"user_id":9294231,"display_name":"Programming Shortcut"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":381,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1666597896,"creation_date":1666286434,"question_id":74143917,"body_markdown":"I made a registration form and I want to validate all filed of the form I validated expect one field to match the fields of PASSWORD matching so make custom validtion but is  not working i attaced code in\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n    @Entity\r\n    public class Userlist {\r\n      ......\r\n      @Size(min = 8, message = &quot;Please enter atleast 8 digit password&quot;)\r\n\t  private String userpassword;\r\n\t  @PasswordMatch(message=&quot;Your Password is not match with created password&quot;)\r\n\t  private String confirmpassword;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n \r\n    package com.picture.picturesalbum.anotation;\r\n\r\n    import static java.lang.annotation.ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE;  \r\n    import static java.lang.annotation.ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR;\r\n    import static java.lang.annotation.ElementType.FIELD;\r\n    import static java.lang.annotation.ElementType.METHOD;\r\n    import static java.lang.annotation.ElementType.PARAMETER;\r\n    import static java.lang.annotation.ElementType.TYPE_USE;\r\n\r\n    import java.lang.annotation.*;\r\n\r\n    import jakarta.validation.Constraint;\r\n    import jakarta.validation.Payload;\r\n\r\n    @Target({ METHOD, FIELD, ANNOTATION_TYPE, CONSTRUCTOR, PARAMETER, TYPE_USE })\r\n    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n    @Documented\r\n    @Constraint(validatedBy = PasswordMatchValidator.class)\r\n    public @interface PasswordMatch {\r\n\r\n\tpublic String message() default &quot;Your Password is not match with created password &quot;;\r\n    public Class&lt;?&gt;[] groups() default {};\r\n    public Class&lt;?

I am no java pro by far, but alas it must be done.</p>\n<p>The repo specifies OpenJDK-14.0.1 and Gradle-6.5 but I have decided to get it running on a newer version of Java and Gradle so that the next poor soul that comes along may have an easier chance of getting setup.</p>\n<p>As such I've gone with OpenJDK-19.0.1 and Gradle-7.5.1 and expectedly there have been some issues.</p>\n<p>One being the <code>compile</code> configuration having been removed from Gradle-7.5.1 replaced with <code>implementation</code> and the second needing to update the version for Lombok to a higher version so I have gone with 1.18.24</p>\n<p>Now the repo builds and 321 of 330 tests pass with 9 failing. This is where I am stuck. All the failing tests are all in the same file and fail because of the same error.

How do I check if a given polygon is in the right order?\r\n\r\nThe thing about the order of the points is that it defines wich side of the polygon is the one that you are intrested in, inner or outter. &quot;MongoDB deterministically chooses the area that is the &quot;smallest of the two&quot;.&quot;, unless you use &quot;Big Polygon&quot;, where you define what order you are using.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to check the order, I found this function that I took from this [validator][4]:\r\n\r\n    function isRingClockwise (coords) {\r\n        var area = 0;\r\n        if (coords.length &gt; 2) {\r\n            var p1, p2;\r\n            for (var i = 0; i &lt; coords.length - 1; i++) {\r\n                p1 = coords[i];\r\n                p2 = coords[i + 1];\r\n                area += rad(p2[0] - p1[0]) * (2 + Math.sin(rad(p1[1])) + Math.sin(rad(p2[1])));\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return area &gt;= 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&gt; 2. Is there a java library that will check if my polygon is valid?\r\n&gt; 3.

The actual library is not published yet but it will be soon.\r\n\r\nRelated to your case, for example, you can build your JSON object like so (I&#39;ve added more fields there just to demonstrate more ways of appending data):\r\n```java\r\nSystem.out.println(\r\n        JsonBuilder.of()\r\n                .add(&quot;tableID&quot;, &quot;1&quot;)\r\n                .add(&quot;price&quot;, &quot;53&quot;)\r\n                .add(&quot;priceString&quot;, &quot;\\&quot;53\\&quot;&quot;)\r\n                .add(&quot;payment = \\&quot;cash\\&quot;&quot;)\r\n                .add(&quot;quantity : 3&quot;)\r\n                .add(&quot;products[0].ID = 1&quot;)\r\n                .add(&quot;products[0].quantity&quot;, &quot;1&quot;)\r\n                .add(&quot;products[1].ID = 3&quot;)\r\n                .add(&quot;products[1].quantity = 2&quot;)\r\n                .add(&quot;products[4].boolean       =   true      &quot;)\r\n                .add(&quot;products[4].booleanString=\\&quot;true\\&quot;&quot;)\r\n                .build()\r\n                .toPrettyString()\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n, which results into the following output:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  &quot;tableID&quot;: 1,\r\n  &quot;price&quot;: 53,\r\n  &quot;priceString&quot;: &quot;53&quot;,\r\n  &quot;payment&quot;: &quot;cash&quot;,\r\n  &quot;quantity&quot;: 3,\r\n  &quot;products&quot;: [\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;ID&quot;: 1,\r\n      &quot;quantity&quot;: 1\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;ID&quot;: 3,\r\n      &quot;quantity&quot;: 2\r\n    },\r\n    null,\r\n    null,\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;boolean&quot;: true,\r\n      &quot;booleanString&quot;: &quot;true&quot;\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The `JsonBuilder` class ##\r\n```java\r\npackage com.me0x.builder;\r\n\r\nimport static java.util.Objects.requireNonNull;\r\n\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ArrayNode;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.BigIntegerNode;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.BooleanNode;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.DecimalNode;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.NullNode;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ObjectNode;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.TextNode;\r\nimport java.math.BigDecimal;\r\nimport java.math.BigInteger;\r\nimport java.util.Arrays;\r\nimport java.util.Iterator;\r\nimport java.util.LinkedList;\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\nimport java.util.Set;\r\nimport lombok.EqualsAndHashCode;\r\nimport lombok.extern.log4j.Log4j2;\r\nimport org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * This class is not a thread safe one.\r\n *\r\n * @author Teodor MAMOLEA\r\n */\r\n@Log4j2\r\n@EqualsAndHashCode\r\npublic final class JsonBuilder {\r\n\r\n    private static final Set&lt;Character&gt; KEY_VALUE_SEPARATORS = Set.of(&#39;:&#39;, &#39;=&#39;);\r\n\r\n    private static final String FIELD_NAME_ARRAY_INDEX_SEPARATOR = &quot;[&quot;;\r\n\r\n    private static final int FIELD_NAME_ARRAY_INDEX_SEPARATOR_LENGTH = FIELD_NAME_ARRAY_INDEX_SEPARATOR.length();\r\n\r\n    private static final NullNode ARRAY_AUTO_FILL_VALUE = new NullNode() {\r\n        // NOP\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    private static final String ROOT_OBJECT_NODE_NAME = &quot;root&quot;;\r\n\r\n    public static JsonBuilder of() {\r\n        return of(new ObjectMapper());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static JsonBuilder of(final ObjectMapper objectMapper) {\r\n        return new JsonBuilder(objectMapper);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static String[] splitKeyValueLine(final String line) {\r\n        if (StringUtils.isBlank(line)) {\r\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Invalid key-value line!&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        final Integer separatorIndex = KEY_VALUE_SEPARATORS.stream()\r\n                .map(line::indexOf)\r\n                .filter(separatorCharacterIndex -&gt; -1 != separatorCharacterIndex)\r\n                .min(Integer::compareTo)\r\n                .orElseThrow(() -&gt; new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Invalid key-value line!&quot;));\r\n\r\n        return new String[]{\r\n                line.substring(0, separatorIndex).trim(),\r\n                line.substring(separatorIndex + 1).trim()\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static Iterator&lt;String&gt; compileJsonFieldName(final String path) {\r\n        if (StringUtils.isEmpty(path)) {\r\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Empty field path can not be interpreted!&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        final String calibratedPath = ROOT_OBJECT_NODE_NAME + (path.startsWith(FIELD_NAME_ARRAY_INDEX_SEPARATOR) ?

And the MethodParameter does not hold the name of the parameter (because its a compiled class I think).</p>\n<p>What I'm wondering is how spring boot itself maps the query parameters to the ones in the controllers methods..... ?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","algorithm","data-structures","dijkstra","heap"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":6674353,"reputation":505,"user_id":5149545,"display_name":"c3R1cGFy"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1666563979,"creation_date":1666563979,"answer_id":74175224,"question_id":74169640,"body_markdown":"Try to add the Edge[] edgeTo array that will track the the edge that you used to reach specific vertex. \r\n\r\nFor example \r\n```\r\nedgeTo[0] = null\r\nedgeTo[1] = Edge( 0 -&gt; 1 )\r\nedgeto[2] = Edge( 1 -&gt; 2 )\r\n\r\nThere is the path 0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2 and you can find it by traversing backwards.\r\n```\r\nYou can create such an array structure by changing the lines:\r\n```java\r\npublic void dijkstra_GetMinDistances(int sourceVertex){\r\n   int INFINITY = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\r\n   boolean[] SPT = new boolean[vertices];\r\n   Edge[] edgeTo = new Edge[vertices];\r\n   ...      \r\n```\r\nand you will update this `edgeTo` array in if statement where you find the shorter distance:\r\n```java\r\nif(currentKey&gt;newKey){\r\n   edgeTo[destination] = edge;\r\n   decreaseKey(minHeap, newKey, destination);\r\n   heapNodes[destination].distance = newKey;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFinally the method that return the shortest part from `source_vertex` to any_other_`vertex` is:\r\n```java\r\npublic List&lt;Edge&gt; pathTo(int vertex) {\r\n    List&lt;Edge&gt; path = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    for (Edge e = edgeTo[vertex]; e != null; e = edgeTo[e.source]) {\r\n        path.addFirst(e);\r\n    }\r\n    return path;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll credits goes to great book and online course https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/ ","title":"Dijkstras algorithm shortest path in directed graph, find the last node taken to destination vertex","body":"<p>Try to add the Edge[] edgeTo array that will track the the edge that you used to reach specific vertex.</p>\n<p>For example</p>\n<pre><code>edgeTo[0] = null\nedgeTo[1] = Edge( 0 -&gt; 1 )\nedgeto[2] = Edge( 1 -&gt; 2 )\n\nThere is the path 0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2 and you can find it by traversing backwards.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can create such an array structure by changing the lines:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public void dijkstra_GetMinDistances(int sourceVertex){\n   int INFINITY = Integer.MAX_VALUE;\n   boolean[] SPT = new boolean[vertices];\n   Edge[] edgeTo = new Edge[vertices];\n   ...      \n</code></pre>\n<p>and you will update this <code>edgeTo</code> array in if statement where you find the shorter distance:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>if(currentKey&gt;newKey){\n   edgeTo[destination] = edge;\n   decreaseKey(minHeap, newKey, destination);\n   heapNodes[destination].distance = newKey;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally the method that return the shortest part from <code>source_vertex</code> to any_other_<code>vertex</code> is:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public List&lt;Edge&gt; pathTo(int vertex) {\n    List&lt;Edge&gt; path = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();\n    for (Edge e = edgeTo[vertex]; e != null; e = edgeTo[e.source]) {\n        path.addFirst(e);\n    }\n    return path;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>All credits goes to great book and online course <a href=\"https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/</a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":26707186,"reputation":3,"user_id":20313172,"display_name":"Beka Bex"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":262,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":74175224,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1666563979,"creation_date":1666513444,"question_id":74169640,"body_markdown":"The code below was taken from https://algorithms.tutorialhorizon.com/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-spt-adjacency-list-and-min-heap-java-implementation/\r\n\r\nit finds the shortest distance to each vertex from a given source vertex but does not as of yet offer a way to track the path taken.

Not only that: there are a bunch of technical reasons as well.\r\n\r\nOne reason is because of how the JVM is implemented. The specification for the Java `class` file format can be found [here][1]. It&#39;s quite a mouthful, but it is very informative. \r\n\r\nAs I said previously, an object can be constructed from anywhere, even situations where *objects do not have names*. Only objects defined as class members have names (for the obvious reason of access): objects constructed in methods do not. The JVM has a local variable table with a maximum of 65535 entries. These are loaded unto the stack and stored into the table via the *load and *store opcodes.\r\n\r\nIn other words, a class like\r\n\r\n    public class Test {\r\n    int class_member = 42;\r\n    \r\n       public Test() {\r\n          int my_local_field = 42;\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\ngets compiled into\r\n\r\n    public class Test extends java.lang.Object\r\n      SourceFile: &quot;Test.java&quot;\r\n      minor version: 0\r\n      major version: 50\r\n      Constant pool:\r\n      --snip--\r\n    \r\n    {\r\n    int class_member;\r\n    \r\n    public Test();\r\n      Code:\r\n       Stack=2, Locals=2, Args_size=1\r\n       0:   aload_0\r\n       1:   invokespecial   #1; //Method java/lang/Object.&quot;&lt;init&gt;&quot;:()V\r\n       4:   aload_0\r\n       5:   bipush  42\r\n       7:   putfield        #2; //Field class_member:I\r\n       10:  bipush  42\r\n       12:  istore_1\r\n       13:  return\r\n      LineNumberTable:\r\n       --snip--    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nThere, you can see a clear example from `javap -v Test` that while the name `class_member`is preserved, the `my_local_field` has been abstracted to index 1 in the local variable table (0 is reserved for `this`).\r\n\r\nThis in itself would be a pain for debuggers and such, so a set of attributes (think metadata for class files) was designed. These include the [LocalVariableTable][2], [LineNumberTable][3], and [LocalVariableTypeTable][4]. These attributes are useful for stacktraces (LineNumberTable), and debuggers (LocalVariableTable and LocalVariableTypeTable).

Not only that: there are a bunch of technical reasons as well.</p>\n\n<p>One reason is because of how the JVM is implemented. The specification for the Java <code>class</code> file format can be found <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. It's quite a mouthful, but it is very informative. </p>\n\n<p>As I said previously, an object can be constructed from anywhere, even situations where <em>objects do not have names</em>. Only objects defined as class members have names (for the obvious reason of access): objects constructed in methods do not. The JVM has a local variable table with a maximum of 65535 entries. These are loaded unto the stack and stored into the table via the *load and *store opcodes.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, a class like</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Test {\nint class_member = 42;\n\n   public Test() {\n      int my_local_field = 42;\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>gets compiled into</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Test extends java.lang.Object\n  SourceFile: \"Test.java\"\n  minor version: 0\n  major version: 50\n  Constant pool:\n  --snip--\n\n{\nint class_member;\n\npublic Test();\n  Code:\n   Stack=2, Locals=2, Args_size=1\n   0:   aload_0\n   1:   invokespecial   #1; //Method java/lang/Object.\"&lt;init&gt;\":()V\n   4:   aload_0\n   5:   bipush  42\n   7:   putfield        #2; //Field class_member:I\n   10:  bipush  42\n   12:  istore_1\n   13:  return\n  LineNumberTable:\n   --snip--    \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There, you can see a clear example from <code>javap -v Test</code> that while the name <code>class_member</code>is preserved, the <code>my_local_field</code> has been abstracted to index 1 in the local variable table (0 is reserved for <code>this</code>).</p>\n\n<p>This in itself would be a pain for debuggers and such, so a set of attributes (think metadata for class files) was designed. These include the <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.12\" rel=\"noreferrer\">LocalVariableTable</a>, <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.12\" rel=\"noreferrer\">LineNumberTable</a>, and <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.7.14\" rel=\"noreferrer\">LocalVariableTypeTable</a>. These attributes are useful for stacktraces (LineNumberTable), and debuggers (LocalVariableTable and LocalVariableTypeTable). However, these are <em>completely optional to include in files, and there is no guarantee that they are:</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The LineNumberTable attribute is an optional variable-length attribute\n  in the attributes table</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The same holds for the rest of them.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, most compilers do not produce anything but the LineNumberTable by default, so you'd be out of luck even if it was possible.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, it would be quite frustrating for developers to have a <code>getFieldName(object)</code> (which wouldn't be possible in the first place for local variables), and only have it work when those attributes are present. </p>\n\n<p>So you are stuck for the foreseeable future with using <code>getField</code> with Strings.
