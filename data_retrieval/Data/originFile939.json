I don&#39;t understand why. But, what I assume is, for some reason you are trying to avoid using &quot;context&quot;. If that is not the case then the above two solutions should work perfectly for you or if you are trying to avoid context, I&#39;m afraid that is not possible with the function with signature setDataSource(String) call. The reason is as below,\r\n\r\nMediaPlayer setDataSource() function has these below options out of which you are only interested in setDataSource(String),\r\n\r\n[![setDataSource Functions][2]][2]\r\n\r\nsetDataSource(String) internally calls setDataSource(String path, String[] keys, String[] values) function. If you can check its [source][3],\r\n\r\n    public void setDataSource(String path)\r\n                throws IOException, IllegalArgumentException, SecurityException, IllegalStateException {\r\n            setDataSource(path, null, null);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nand if you check setDataSource(String path, String[] keys, String[] values) code, you will see the below condition filtering the path based on its scheme, particularly if it is &quot;file&quot; scheme it calls setDataSource(FileDescriptor) or if scheme is non &quot;file&quot;, it calls native JNI media function. \r\n\r\n    {\r\n            final Uri uri = Uri.parse(path);\r\n            final String scheme = uri.getScheme();\r\n            if (&quot;file&quot;.equals(scheme)) {\r\n                path = uri.getPath();\r\n            } else if (scheme != null) {\r\n                // handle non-file sources\r\n                nativeSetDataSource(\r\n                    MediaHTTPService.createHttpServiceBinderIfNecessary(path),\r\n                    path,\r\n                    keys,\r\n                    values);\r\n                return;\r\n            }\r\n            final File file = new File(path);\r\n            if (file.exists()) {\r\n                FileInputStream is = new FileInputStream(file);\r\n                FileDescriptor fd = is.getFD();\r\n                setDataSource(fd);\r\n                is.close();\r\n            } else {\r\n                throw new IOException(&quot;setDataSource failed.&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the above code, your resource file URI scheme will not be null (android.resource://) and **setDataSource(String) will try to use native JNI function nativeSetDataSource() thinking that your path is http/https/rtsp and obviously that call will fail as well without throwing any exception. Thats why your call to setDataSource(String) escapes without an exception and gets to prepare() call with the following exception.** \r\n\r\n    Prepare failed.: status=0x1\r\n\r\nSo setDataSource(String) override cannot handle your resource file. You need to choose another override for that.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, check setDataSource(Context context, Uri uri, Map&lt;String, String&gt; headers) which is used by setDataSource(Context context, Uri uri), it uses AssetFileDescriptor, ContentResolver from your context and openAssetFileDescriptor to open the URI which gets success as openAssetFileDescriptor() can open your resource file and finally the resultant fd is used to call setDataSource(FileDescriptor) override.\r\n\r\n        AssetFileDescriptor fd = null;\r\n        try {\r\n            ContentResolver resolver = context.getContentResolver();\r\n            fd = resolver.openAssetFileDescriptor(uri, &quot;r&quot;);\r\n            //  :\r\n            //  :\r\n            //  :\r\n            if (fd.getDeclaredLength() &lt; 0) {\r\n                    setDataSource(fd.getFileDescriptor());\r\n                } else {\r\n                    setDataSource(fd.getFileDescriptor(), fd.getStartOffset(), fd.getDeclaredLength());\r\n                }\r\n\r\nTo conclude, you cannot use setDataSource(String) override as is to use your resource mp3 file. Instead, if you want use string to play your resource file you can use either MediaPlayer.create() static function with getIdentifier() as given above or setDataSource(context,uri) as given in Update#1.\r\n\r\nRefer to the complete source code for more understanding here: [Android MediaPlayer][3]\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n**Update #3:**\r\n&lt;h3&gt;openFrameworks setDataSource(String):&lt;/h3&gt;\r\nAs I have mentioned in the comments below, openFrameworks uses android MediaPlayer code asis. If you can refer to Line no: 4,\r\n\r\n    import android.media.MediaPlayer;\r\nand Line no: 26, 27, 28 and 218\r\n\r\n\t\t\tplayer = new MediaPlayer();       //26\r\n\t\t\tplayer.setDataSource(fileName);   //27\r\n\t\t\tplayer.prepare();                 //28\r\n            \r\n            private MediaPlayer player;       //218\r\n\r\nSo, if you try to pass **ardroid.resource//+ this.getPackageName() + &quot;raw/test0&quot;** to setDataSource() using openFrameworks, you will still get the same exception as I explained in Update#2. Having said that, I just tried my luck searching Google to double sure what I am saying and found this [openFrameworks forum link][4] where one of the **openFrameworks core developer arturo** says, \r\n\r\n&gt; don&#39;t know exactly how the mediaPlayer works but everything in res/raw\r\n&gt; or bin/data gets copied to /sdcard/cc.openframeworks.packagename\r\n\r\nBased on that comment, you may try using the copied path in setDataSource(). Using resource file on setDataSource(String) of MediaPlayer is not possible as it cannot accept resource file path. Please note that, I said &quot;resource file path&quot; starts with the scheme **android.resource//** which is actually a jar location (within your apk), not a physical location. Local file will work with setDataSource(String) which starts with the scheme **file://**.\r\n\r\nTo make you clearly understand what you are trying to do with a resource file, try executing this below code and see the result in logcat,\r\n  \r\n\r\n        try{\r\n          Log.d(&quot;RESURI&quot;, this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(&quot;res/raw/test0&quot;).toURI().toString());\r\n        } \r\n        catch(Exception e) {\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll get the result as,\r\n\r\n    jar:file:/data/app/&lt;packagename&gt;/&lt;apkname&gt;.apk!/res/raw/test0\r\n\r\nthat is to show you that the resource file you are trying to access is not actually a file in physical path but a jar location (within apk) which you cannot access using setDataSource(String) method. (Try using 7zip to extract your apk file and you will see the res/raw/test0 in it).\r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n\r\nPS: I know its bit lengthy answer, but I hope this explains it in detail.

I don't understand why. But, what I assume is, for some reason you are trying to avoid using \"context\". If that is not the case then the above two solutions should work perfectly for you or if you are trying to avoid context, I'm afraid that is not possible with the function with signature setDataSource(String) call. The reason is as below,</p>\n\n<p>MediaPlayer setDataSource() function has these below options out of which you are only interested in setDataSource(String),</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fkYMA.png\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fkYMA.png\" alt=\"setDataSource Functions\"></a></p>\n\n<p>setDataSource(String) internally calls setDataSource(String path, String[] keys, String[] values) function. If you can check its <a href=\"https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/media/java/android/media/MediaPlayer.java\">source</a>,</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void setDataSource(String path)\n            throws IOException, IllegalArgumentException, SecurityException, IllegalStateException {\n        setDataSource(path, null, null);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and if you check setDataSource(String path, String[] keys, String[] values) code, you will see the below condition filtering the path based on its scheme, particularly if it is \"file\" scheme it calls setDataSource(FileDescriptor) or if scheme is non \"file\", it calls native JNI media function. </p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n        final Uri uri = Uri.parse(path);\n        final String scheme = uri.getScheme();\n        if (\"file\".equals(scheme)) {\n            path = uri.getPath();\n        } else if (scheme != null) {\n            // handle non-file sources\n            nativeSetDataSource(\n                MediaHTTPService.createHttpServiceBinderIfNecessary(path),\n                path,\n                keys,\n                values);\n            return;\n        }\n        final File file = new File(path);\n        if (file.exists()) {\n            FileInputStream is = new FileInputStream(file);\n            FileDescriptor fd = is.getFD();\n            setDataSource(fd);\n            is.close();\n        } else {\n            throw new IOException(\"setDataSource failed.\");\n        }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above code, your resource file URI scheme will not be null (android.resource://) and <strong>setDataSource(String) will try to use native JNI function nativeSetDataSource() thinking that your path is http/https/rtsp and obviously that call will fail as well without throwing any exception. Thats why your call to setDataSource(String) escapes without an exception and gets to prepare() call with the following exception.</strong> </p>\n\n<pre><code>Prepare failed.: status=0x1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So setDataSource(String) override cannot handle your resource file.

His speed is 20 pixels per second. So if we want to move our player with this speed we need to know UPS. For example, UPS is 20. So our player will move 20 pixels per tick. And that’s wrong. If it is then with our 20 ticks, for 1 second our player will move 20*20 pixels (400 pixels per second). So speed of our player will be 20 * (1 / UPS) per tick. We can change our UPS and number of pixels player move per tick will be changed too. But he will be still move 20 pixels per second. To make it clear assume our UPS is 1 it means one tick per second. Then speed will be 20 * (1 / 1) = 20 pixels per tick (in one second is one tick) = 30 pixels per second. The same as we want.&lt;br&gt;\r\n2. Render just draws what we update. It can do it with the same rate as we update also I it can do it faster. But it doesn’t matter, because we will see only what we update. UPS can be 1 but FPS is 160.

The compiler can then check that your <code>switch</code> statement has covered all the possibilities.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>sealed class Véhicule permits Voiture, Camion, Moto { }\n\nfinal class Voiture extends Véhicule { }\n\nfinal class Camion extends Véhicule { }\n\nfinal class Moto extends Véhicule { }\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":26570583,"reputation":1,"user_id":20196860,"display_name":"SayarS"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":111,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1666495160,"creation_date":1666441000,"question_id":74163475,"body_markdown":"I have a class `Vehicule` and 3 subclasses `Voiture`, `Camion` and `Moto`.\r\nI also have a method `getVehicules` for the all vehicules  (i.e. camion, voiture, moto) but I want to print\r\na specific type like Voiture.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know how to solve  it .\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n     List&lt;Vehicule&gt; vehicules = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    \r\n        public void getVehicules() {\r\n        \t\tvehicules.forEach(vehicule-&gt;{\r\n        \t\t\tSystem.out.println(vehicule);\r\n        \t\t});    \t\r\n    \r\n         }\r\n    \t\r\n    \tpublic void getVoitures() {\r\n    \t\tIterator iterator = vehicules.iterator();\r\n    \t\twhile(iterator.hasNext()) {\r\n    \r\n          //I want to do a condtion if vehicule is voiture it will disaplay\r\n    \r\n    \t\t    if(vehicules.equals(voiture)) {\r\n    \t\t    \tSystem.out.println(iterator);\r\n    \t\t    }\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t}\r\n\r\n","title":"How to compare two data types in Java","body":"<p>I have a class <code>Vehicule</code> and 3 subclasses <code>Voiture</code>, <code>Camion</code> and <code>Moto</code>.\nI also have a method <code>getVehicules</code> for the all vehicules  (i.e. camion, voiture, moto) but I want to print\na specific type like Voiture.</p>\n<p>I don't know how to solve  it .</p>\n<pre><code> List&lt;Vehicule&gt; vehicules = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n\n    public void getVehicules() {\n            vehicules.forEach(vehicule-&gt;{\n                System.out.println(vehicule);\n            });     \n\n     }\n    \n    public void getVoitures() {\n        Iterator iterator = vehicules.iterator();\n        while(iterator.hasNext()) {\n\n      //I want to do a condtion if vehicule is voiture it will disaplay\n\n            if(vehicules.equals(voiture)) {\n                System.out.println(iterator);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","collections","set"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2709823,"reputation":10716,"user_id":2338547,"display_name":"markspace"},"score":2,"creation_date":1666149213,"post_id":74119390,"comment_id":130864737,"body_markdown":"`HashSet` uses a hashing algorithm to store its elements internally.

It&#39;s not truly _exactly_ like anything else. And yet, us humans need to try to come to grips with it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a _lot_ of programming concepts use words that already existed in the english language. We call these things &#39;objects&#39;. We could have chosen to call them &#39;floobargles&#39; instead, or &#39;bultizats&#39; - pick a word with no inherent meaning to avoid confusion. But that also has downsides: If your first steps into learning a language involves learning 500 completely unique words first, you&#39;re going to get utterly lost.\r\n\r\nThus, a dilemma:\r\n\r\nUse words with an already established meaning, such as &#39;object&#39;, &#39;method&#39;, &#39;function&#39;, &#39;actor&#39;, &#39;language&#39;, &#39;line (of code)&#39;, &#39;reference&#39;, &#39;pointer&#39;, &#39;instantiating&#39; (we&#39;re teetering close to just making up entirely new words there perhaps), and so on: The meaning that these words already have helps; these aren&#39;t chosen arbitrarily, a _lot_ of what an object (in the Java Language Specification sense) is and does is a lot like an object (in the &#39;word in the english dictionary&#39; sense). But, inevitably, there are things where the simile falls down and in fact completely steers you wrong.\r\n\r\nBut, use newly minted words and the learning curve for those new to the language is off the scale.\r\n\r\nQuite the dilemma.\r\n\r\nI remember some very well meaning, but in the end completely wrong and highly misleading, post about why one should not use exceptions as control flow. The gist of it was something along the lines of:\r\n\r\n_Using exceptions for control flow is like having bowling-lane style bumpers next to the highway and driving down the road by haphazardly bouncing between the bumpers_.\r\n\r\nThe error being made here is that the word &#39;exception&#39; suggests error in the english sense of the word - a mistake, critically, _something to be avoided_. But that isn&#39;t in the language spec. Nowhere in the Java Lang Spec (or ECMAScript spec - that&#39;s the javascript equivalent of the JLS) does it say that exceptions &#39;should be avoided&#39;. Quite the opposite. Also, a human would not like being jostled about while their car smashes between bumpers. Code execution isn&#39;t a human, code doesn&#39;t have feelings. It wouldn&#39;t care. There are certainly arguments one can make about using the Exception mechanism to do control flow (or rather, arguments to suggest one should _not_ do that), but &#39;its like the bumpers on a bowling alley&#39; is not one of them.\r\n\r\nCorrect arguments would involve performance, or an explanation about how it leads to &#39;spaghetti&#39; (itself a slang term meaning: Code whose &#39;flow&#39; is hard for humans to intuit). Arguments that work just as well if exceptions were called &#39;whutsits&#39; instead.\r\n\r\n## On to your dilemma specifically\r\n\r\nIn javascript, functions are assignable to variables exactly like values are. This line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar x = 5;\r\n```\r\n\r\nis valid javascript _and also_ valid java. (Using the new `var` keyword which just types the declaration to the obvious thing; it is identical to the to you probably more familiar `int x = 5;` - java is still typed, the type of the `x` variable is `int` here, in java. Javascript is still untyped, you can assign a string to `x` later in javascript, not in java).\r\n\r\nHowever, this is valid javascript:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar x = function(a, b) { return a + b; }\r\n```\r\n\r\n... but not valid java &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;\r\nand, crucially, x acts exactly the same. You can pass `x` around (you are now passing _a function_ to _a function_ which if we stick to the purely english meaning of the word is starting to get truly mind bogglingly weird. But step away from that - use the plasticity of the brain to blur the lines between what these words mean in english vs. what they mean in the lang spec, and it&#39;s really not that hard to understand the idea of passing functions around to other functions). You can ask x what kind of object it is (and it will say: I am a function).\r\n\r\nIn other words, `x` is now pointing at a function... _which is also an object_. Like in physics, light is both a wave and a particle, and also is neither (there are ways in which light is NOT like waves at all, and ways in which light is NOT like particles at all) - and so are functions in javascript. They are like objects in some ways, and not like them in other ways.\r\n\r\nThe real problem is simply communication. The book / tutorial / person who is telling you &quot;functions are like objects&quot; is _actually_ trying to convey something that takes way more words to say. For example, their _intent_ is to communicate the idea: &quot;Functions in javascript can be written anywhere values can be, and can be stored in the same places values can be, and they even _are_ a dictionary (see below), and can be passed around just like values can be&quot;.\r\n\r\nIn _their head_, &#39;Functions are objects&#39; _exactly_ covers this, and thus to them it&#39;s simply an easier way to say the same thing.\r\n\r\nSo, their brain tells their mouth to make sounds, your ears hear these sounds and your brain... comes to a _completely different conclusion_.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s simply failure of communication: Words were said, you understood the basic meaning (you didn&#39;t mishear them), and yet the point of using your words is to communicate and that emphatically did not happen here. They MEANT one thing, and you UNDERSTOOD a different thing.\r\n\r\nIt happens, all the time, in all sorts of different contexts. Programming is by no means unique in this.\r\n\r\nThe upshot is: So what, right? If you think &#39;functions are like objects&#39; is not correct at all, that doesn&#39;t mean that you are wrong, or that the person who says &#39;functions ARE like objects&#39; are wrong. It might merely mean that you have a pretty fundamental different idea about what these words mean. There generally is no dictator that decides what a given word is to mean, and who will decree anyone is to be killed who fails to use the word in precisely the determined fashion.\r\n\r\nThe one place you get into trouble is, again, communication. If everybody else on the entire planet conjures up X idea when they hear the word &#39;object&#39;, and you are the only one who conjures up opposite idea Y, then you live in your own little world, which is a bad thing: Programming is a team effort. Even if you write your code on your own, you read tutorials, books, use libraries, write documentation, and so on. It is _inevitable_ that shorthand, jargon, and slang drips into docs, and if you just aren&#39;t thinking of the same thing everybody else is thinking of, your docs are unreadable to others, and you are not capable of reading docs written by others.\r\n\r\nAnd therein lies a complication: Even though there is no dictatorial source of the true meaning of every bit of jargon, the opposite (everybody just gets to pick what they feel any bit of jargon means, it&#39;s all equally valid) leads to chaos. Everybody needs to make their own call on this.\r\n\r\nHowever, certain words are used and specifically defined in official specifications, or are above 99% agreement amongst all programmers in the entire community. Clearly for those words, it&#39;s best to just jump on the bandwagon.\r\n\r\nAnd &#39;object&#39;, for javascript, might be one of them. In javascript, objects have properties you can set and read:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar x = {};\r\nx[&quot;hello&quot;] = &quot;goodbye&quot;;\r\nconsole.log(x.hello); // prints &#39;goodbye&#39;.\r\nx(); // fails; x is not a function.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWeirdly enough you can do that to functions:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar x = function() {};\r\nx[&quot;hello&quot;] = &quot;goodbye&quot;;\r\nconsole.log(x.hello); // works\r\nx(); // works fine - x is a function that does nothing.\r\nconsole.log(x.hello); // still works, prints &#39;goodbye&#39;.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHence, &#39;functions are also objects&#39;. Yes, at this point the english underlying meaning of these words is starting to, if anything, be confusing. How can a thing be a verb but also be, more or less, a noun? In english, that&#39;s a stupid idea.\r\n\r\nIn javascript, well, that&#39;s just how it is. Whatever words or similes you need to conjure up so that your brain easily intuits the way of things (that is, you read some javascript code and correctly understand what it does nearly instantly), do that. Most people think saying &#39;functions are objects&#39; is how to get there. But maybe for you that&#39;s just confusing. That&#39;s fine.\r\n\r\n[1] Something like `Runnable r = () -&gt; {};` _is_ valid java, but something quite different is going on there: That function definition (`() -&gt; {}` - no arguments in, do nothing out) is being treated as an instance of a newly minted, anonymously named class that subtypes Runnable, and has an implementation of its only `abstract` method: `void run();`, and that function is it.","title":"Functions beeing called as different types of objects in Javascript.

Arguments that work just as well if exceptions were called 'whutsits' instead.</p>\n<h2>On to your dilemma specifically</h2>\n<p>In javascript, functions are assignable to variables exactly like values are. This line:</p>\n<pre><code>var x = 5;\n</code></pre>\n<p>is valid javascript <em>and also</em> valid java. (Using the new <code>var</code> keyword which just types the declaration to the obvious thing; it is identical to the to you probably more familiar <code>int x = 5;</code> - java is still typed, the type of the <code>x</code> variable is <code>int</code> here, in java. Javascript is still untyped, you can assign a string to <code>x</code> later in javascript, not in java).</p>\n<p>However, this is valid javascript:</p>\n<pre><code>var x = function(a, b) { return a + b; }\n</code></pre>\n<p>... but not valid java <sup>1</sup>\nand, crucially, x acts exactly the same. You can pass <code>x</code> around (you are now passing <em>a function</em> to <em>a function</em> which if we stick to the purely english meaning of the word is starting to get truly mind bogglingly weird. But step away from that - use the plasticity of the brain to blur the lines between what these words mean in english vs. what they mean in the lang spec, and it's really not that hard to understand the idea of passing functions around to other functions). You can ask x what kind of object it is (and it will say: I am a function).</p>\n<p>In other words, <code>x</code> is now pointing at a function... <em>which is also an object</em>. Like in physics, light is both a wave and a particle, and also is neither (there are ways in which light is NOT like waves at all, and ways in which light is NOT like particles at all) - and so are functions in javascript. They are like objects in some ways, and not like them in other ways.</p>\n<p>The real problem is simply communication. The book / tutorial / person who is telling you &quot;functions are like objects&quot; is <em>actually</em> trying to convey something that takes way more words to say. For example, their <em>intent</em> is to communicate the idea: &quot;Functions in javascript can be written anywhere values can be, and can be stored in the same places values can be, and they even <em>are</em> a dictionary (see below), and can be passed around just like values can be&quot;.</p>\n<p>In <em>their head</em>, 'Functions are objects' <em>exactly</em> covers this, and thus to them it's simply an easier way to say the same thing.</p>\n<p>So, their brain tells their mouth to make sounds, your ears hear these sounds and your brain... comes to a <em>completely different conclusion</em>.</p>\n<p>That's simply failure of communication: Words were said, you understood the basic meaning (you didn't mishear them), and yet the point of using your words is to communicate and that emphatically did not happen here. They MEANT one thing, and you UNDERSTOOD a different thing.</p>\n<p>It happens, all the time, in all sorts of different contexts. Programming is by no means unique in this.</p>\n<p>The upshot is: So what, right? If you think 'functions are like objects' is not correct at all, that doesn't mean that you are wrong, or that the person who says 'functions ARE like objects' are wrong. It might merely mean that you have a pretty fundamental different idea about what these words mean. There generally is no dictator that decides what a given word is to mean, and who will decree anyone is to be killed who fails to use the word in precisely the determined fashion.</p>\n<p>The one place you get into trouble is, again, communication. If everybody else on the entire planet conjures up X idea when they hear the word 'object', and you are the only one who conjures up opposite idea Y, then you live in your own little world, which is a bad thing: Programming is a team effort. Even if you write your code on your own, you read tutorials, books, use libraries, write documentation, and so on. It is <em>inevitable</em> that shorthand, jargon, and slang drips into docs, and if you just aren't thinking of the same thing everybody else is thinking of, your docs are unreadable to others, and you are not capable of reading docs written by others.</p>\n<p>And therein lies a complication: Even though there is no dictatorial source of the true meaning of every bit of jargon, the opposite (everybody just gets to pick what they feel any bit of jargon means, it's all equally valid) leads to chaos. Everybody needs to make their own call on this.</p>\n<p>However, certain words are used and specifically defined in official specifications, or are above 99% agreement amongst all programmers in the entire community. Clearly for those words, it's best to just jump on the bandwagon.</p>\n<p>And 'object', for javascript, might be one of them. In javascript, objects have properties you can set and read:</p>\n<pre><code>var x = {};\nx[&quot;hello&quot;] = &quot;goodbye&quot;;\nconsole.log(x.hello); // prints 'goodbye'.\nx(); // fails; x is not a function.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Weirdly enough you can do that to functions:</p>\n<pre><code>var x = function() {};\nx[&quot;hello&quot;] = &quot;goodbye&quot;;\nconsole.log(x.hello); // works\nx(); // works fine - x is a function that does nothing.\nconsole.log(x.hello); // still works, prints 'goodbye'.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Hence, 'functions are also objects'. Yes, at this point the english underlying meaning of these words is starting to, if anything, be confusing. How can a thing be a verb but also be, more or less, a noun? In english, that's a stupid idea.</p>\n<p>In javascript, well, that's just how it is. Whatever words or similes you need to conjure up so that your brain easily intuits the way of things (that is, you read some javascript code and correctly understand what it does nearly instantly), do that. Most people think saying 'functions are objects' is how to get there. But maybe for you that's just confusing. That's fine.</p>\n<p>[1] Something like <code>Runnable r = () -&gt; {};</code> <em>is</em> valid java, but something quite different is going on there: That function definition (<code>() -&gt; {}</code> - no arguments in, do nothing out) is being treated as an instance of a newly minted, anonymously named class that subtypes Runnable, and has an implementation of its only <code>abstract</code> method: <code>void run();</code>, and that function is it.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":26704646,"reputation":1,"user_id":20311076,"display_name":"Brian Moreira"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1666495109,"answer_count":3,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1666482415,"creation_date":1666476657,"question_id":74167436,"body_markdown":"Hope you&#39;re well.
