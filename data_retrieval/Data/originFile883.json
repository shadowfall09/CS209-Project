Does anyone know how I can do this?</p>\n<p>I used the following at <em>Action</em> of an <em>Event</em> for setting the due date of an order to 18:00:00 PM</p>\n<pre><code>`Order order = new Order();\n// Set due date as fixed time\nCalendar cal1 = Calendar.getInstance();\ncal1.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY,18);\ncal1.set(Calendar.MINUTE,00);\ncal1.set(Calendar.SECOND,0);\ncal1.set(Calendar.MILLISECOND,0);\norder.atrDueDate1 = cal1.getTime();\norder.atrID= 10;\norder.markParametersAreSet();\nenter.take(order);`\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, I do not want to fix the due date for all generated orders to 18:00:00 PM, but in the way I described before (chosen from the 4 times)</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","unit-testing","retrofit2","integration-testing"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2486870,"reputation":685,"user_id":2165146,"display_name":"muhammed ozbilici"},"score":0,"creation_date":1668547713,"post_id":74450120,"comment_id":131431345,"body_markdown":"check this example please : https://www.baeldung.com/spring-mock-rest-template","body":"check this example please : <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/spring-mock-rest-template\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">baeldung.com/spring-mock-rest-template</a>"}],"owner":{"account_id":26941965,"reputation":21,"user_id":20512623,"display_name":"Amin alvandi"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":811,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1668534684,"creation_date":1668534684,"question_id":74450120,"body_markdown":"I have a project written with java and spring boot.\r\nwhich I have in the program api call.\r\nFor this project, I need to write a test and I want to mock the response of api call.\r\nI use retrofit for third party api call.\r\nMy question is, how can I do this? \r\nI should write unit test or integration test? which on is correct? which on is the best practice?\r\n\r\n[This is how I make the retrofit.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/c6GFZ.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI used wired mock library but it didn&#39;t do what I wanted.","title":"Mock third party api call in test","body":"<p>I have a project written with java and spring boot.\nwhich I have in the program api call.\nFor this project, I need to write a test and I want to mock the response of api call.\nI use retrofit for third party api call.\nMy question is, how can I do this?\nI should write unit test or integration test? which on is correct? which on is the best practice?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/c6GFZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This is how I make the retrofit.</a></p>\n<p>I used wired mock library but it didn't do what I wanted.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2698782,"reputation":38625,"user_id":2330053,"display_name":"Idle_Mind"},"score":0,"creation_date":1668529775,"post_id":74449006,"comment_id":131425374,"body_markdown":"Be more specific.

I&#39;ve even added Logs to every second line but nothing gets passed as the method never starts.\r\n\r\nI also tried adding the values from the object into separate variables and passing them through (I rewrote the helper method) but it still crashes.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m very close to throwing my laptop through the window, please help me.\r\n\r\nMy placeholder search class\r\n\r\n    \r\n    package com.example.mediacatalogue;\r\n\r\n    //This class is used to query the details of the barcode scanned or entered\r\n    //This in done in lieu of an open online database\r\n    //If an online database is found this class can be replaced to utilise it\r\n    public class SearchForBarcode{\r\n    //Initialise Variables\r\n    public String barcode;\r\n    public String mediatype;\r\n    public String title;\r\n    public String author;\r\n\r\n    //Set variables based on the input barcode\r\n    public SearchForBarcode(String inputBarcode){        \r\n        barcode = inputBarcode;\r\n        //An if statement is used because switch case cannot be used for anything other than int\r\n        //And a 13 digit barcode is too big to fit in an int variable.\r\n        //(JDK 1.7 supports string based cases but Android does not support it)\r\n        if (barcode.equals(&quot;5014503113629&quot;)){\r\n            mediatype = &quot;DVD&quot;;\r\n            title = &quot;The Young Ones Series One&quot;;\r\n            author = &quot;Rik Mayall, Ade Edmondson, Nigel Planer, Christopher Ryan, Alexei Sayle&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        else if (barcode.equals(&quot;5014503151423&quot;)){\r\n            mediatype = &quot;DVD&quot;;\r\n            title = &quot;The Office: Complete Series One &amp; Two&quot;;\r\n            author = &quot;Ricky Gervais, Martin Freeman, Mackenzie Crook, Lucy Davis&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        else if (barcode.equals(&quot;5050582261103&quot;)){\r\n            mediatype = &quot;DVD&quot;;\r\n            title = &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;;\r\n            author = &quot;Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Lucy davis, Kate Ashfield, Dylan Moran, Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        else if (barcode.equals(&quot;5021290037243&quot;)){\r\n            mediatype = &quot;Game&quot;;\r\n            title = &quot;Batman: Arkham Asylum (PS3)&quot;;\r\n            author = &quot;Warner Brothers&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        else if (barcode.equals(&quot;5026555402323&quot;)){\r\n            mediatype = &quot;Game&quot;;\r\n            title = &quot;Bioshock 2 (PS3)&quot;;\r\n            author = &quot;2K Games&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        else if (barcode.equals(&quot;5021290046573&quot;)){\r\n            mediatype = &quot;Game&quot;;\r\n            title = &quot;Tomb Raider Trilogy HD (PS3)&quot;;\r\n            author = &quot;Crystal Dynamics&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        else if (barcode.equals(&quot;6025273901261&quot;)){\r\n            mediatype = &quot;CD&quot;;\r\n            title = &quot;Flesh Tone&quot;;\r\n            author = &quot;Kelis&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        else if (barcode.equals(&quot;724358480924&quot;)){\r\n            mediatype = &quot;CD&quot;;\r\n            title = &quot;Duran Duran&quot;;\r\n            author = &quot;Duran Duran&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        else if (barcode.equals(&quot;5099969605529&quot;)){\r\n            mediatype = &quot;CD&quot;;\r\n            title = &quot;Sounds of the Universe&quot;;\r\n            author = &quot;Depeche Mode&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        else if (barcode.equals(&quot;9781427802118&quot;)){\r\n            mediatype = &quot;Book&quot;;\r\n            title = &quot;Sgt Frog Vol. 13&quot;;\r\n            author = &quot;Mine Yoshizaki&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        else if (barcode.equals(&quot;978009940953&quot;)){\r\n            mediatype = &quot;Book&quot;;\r\n            title = &quot;Star Wars - The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime&quot;;\r\n            author = &quot;R.

QUESTION : First of all, where should the .so files exist in my device after installing the APK ? \r\n\r\n* Starting From **Android M**, it supports **uncompressed native librarie**s in APKs, which allows the platform to read the native libraries **directly from the APK** without having to extract them.It have the flag **android:extractNativeLibs** which is default **false**. This is why you don&#39;t see them in the **&quot;data/data/packagename/lib/&quot;** directory if you&#39;re testing on a device on Android M or later.\r\n\r\n* Ultimately for testing purpose you can use **android:extractNativeLibs=&quot;true**&quot; in Application tag of AndroidManifest.xml, to see in &quot;data/data/packagename/lib/&quot; folder. \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n           &lt;application\r\n        \tandroid:extractNativeLibs=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\r\n        \t  ...\r\n           &lt;/application&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

So replacing it with <code>static ArrayList &lt;Employees&gt; employeesArrayList;</code> seems to be what you want to do :D</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":23677584,"reputation":89,"user_id":17703613,"display_name":"OrlandoVSilva"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":74448789,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1668528617,"creation_date":1668526966,"question_id":74448412,"body_markdown":"I hope you are able to help me.\r\n\r\nMy question is:\r\n\r\nWhen passing an instance of an object that is in an arraylist, and I pass that arraylist to another class, how do I access it&#39;s atributes?\r\n\r\nI can access the attributes before passing it to another class.\r\n\r\nThe &quot;Main&quot; class, passes on the data, to the &quot;Employees&quot; class.\r\n```\r\nEmployees employees = new Employees();\r\nemployees.addEmployee(&quot;Orlando&quot;, &quot;Silva&quot;, 111111111, &quot;St. King&#39;s Street&quot;, 111111111, 11111111111111L, employees.getMinimumWage(), employees.getDayShift());\r\nemployees.addEmployee(&quot;Rui&quot;, &quot;Guilherme&quot;, 111111111, &quot;St. King&#39;s Street&quot;, 111111111, 11111111111111L, employees.getMinimumWage(), employees.getNightShift());\r\nemployees.addEmployee(&quot;Marco&quot;, &quot;Alberto&quot;, 111111111, &quot;St. King&#39;s Street&quot;, 111111111, 11111111111111L, employees.getMinimumWage(), employees.getNightShift());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe &quot;Employees&quot; class receives the data, adds it to an array, and from that array goes to the &quot;AllStaff&quot; class\r\n\r\nNotice, that I have access to the atributes, in the method &quot;addToAllStaff()&quot;\r\n```\r\npublic class Employees {\r\n    // Atributes\r\n    public String name;\r\n    private String lName;\r\n    private int nID;\r\n    private String address;\r\n    private int phNum;\r\n    private long nSocialSecNum;\r\n    private double minimumWage = 740.83;\r\n    private double employeeWage;\r\n    private String dayShift = &quot;Day shift&quot;, afternoonShift = &quot;Afternoon shift&quot;, nightShift = &quot;Night shift&quot;;\r\n    private String shift;\r\n\r\n    private ArrayList&lt;Employees&gt; employeesArrayList = new ArrayList&lt;Employees&gt;();\r\n    private AllStaff allStaff = new AllStaff();\r\n    //---------------------\r\n    // Constructors\r\n    public Employees(){\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public Employees(String name, String lName, int nID, String address, int phNum, long nSocialSecNum, double minimumWage, String shift){\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n        this.lName = lName;\r\n        this.nID = nID;\r\n        this.address = address;\r\n        this.phNum = phNum;\r\n        this.nSocialSecNum = nSocialSecNum;\r\n        this.employeeWage = minimumWage;\r\n        this.shift = shift;\r\n        //----------------\r\n        extraWage();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    //---------------------\r\n\r\n    public void addEmployee(String name, String lName, int nID, String address, int phNum, long nSocialSecNum, double minimumWage, String shift){\r\n           Employees employee = new Employees(name, lName, nID, address, phNum, nSocialSecNum, minimumWage, shift);\r\n           employeesArrayList.add(employee);\r\n           addToAllStaff();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void addToAllStaff(){\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;(Class Employees) employees size: &quot; + employeesArrayList.size());\r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; employeesArrayList.size(); i++){\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Employee names: &quot; + employeesArrayList.get(i).getName());\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Employee names: &quot; + employeesArrayList.get(i).name);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        allStaff.addEmployees(employeesArrayList);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn the class &quot;AllStaff&quot;, is where I don&#39;t have access to the attributes\r\n```\r\npublic class AllStaff {\r\n    static ArrayList &lt;AllStaff&gt; employeesArrayList;\r\n\r\n    public AllStaff(){\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void addEmployees(ArrayList listOfEmployees){\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;List of employees size: &quot; + listOfEmployees.size());\r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; listOfEmployees.size(); i++){\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Employee names: &quot; + listOfEmployees.get(i).getName());\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Employee names: &quot; + listOfEmployees.get(i).name);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        this.employeesArrayList = listOfEmployees;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nFor the whole code, please visit this link: https://github.com/OrlandoVSilva/test-to-github/tree/master/test-to-github/src/mercado\r\n\r\nI hope this question has everything you need.\r\nThanks","title":"Why can&#39;t I access the Object&#39;s properties from another class?

It would look something like this (<em>note</em>, this is untested code):</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class ProductIdGenerator implements IdentifierGenerator, org.hibernate.id.Configurable {\n\n    public static final String GENERATOR_NAME = &quot;produtcIdGenerator&quot;;\n    public static final String PREFIX_PARAM = &quot;prefix&quot;;\n\n    private String prefix = &quot;&quot;;\n\n    @Override\n    public void configure(Type type, Properties params, ServiceRegistry serviceRegistry) throws MappingException {\n        this.prefix = params.getProperty(PREFIX_PARAM, &quot;&quot;);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Serializable generate(SharedSessionContractImplementor session, Object entityObject) throws HibernateException {\n        String uuid = UUID.randomUUID().toString().substring(0, 8);\n\n        return prefix + uuid;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>References to it would look like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(generator = ProductIdGenerator.GENERATOR_NAME)\n    @GenericGenerator(\n                    name = ProductIdGenerator.GENERATOR_NAME,\n                    strategy = &quot;net.ddns.mrq.util.ProductIdGenerator&quot;,\n                    parameters = {@Parameter(name = ProductIdGenerator.PREFIX_PARAM, value = &quot;foo&quot;)})\n    private String id;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Personally, I find the second idea a little cleaner, but there's nothing wrong with the first that I can see.
