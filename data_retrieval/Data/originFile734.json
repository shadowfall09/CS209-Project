integerFilter = change -&gt; {\n    String newText = change.getControlNewText();\n    // if proposed change results in a valid value, return change as-is:\n    if (newText.matches(&quot;-?([1-9][0-9]*)?&quot;)) { \n        return change;\n    } else if (&quot;-&quot;.equals(change.getText()) ) {\n\n        // if user types or pastes a &quot;-&quot;

How to read info from API\r\n 2. How to parse it.\r\n\r\nThe first part you already did. But you can do it with less code by far. You can use 3d party HTTP clients. The most popular are [Apache Http Client][1] with good tutorial - [Apache HttpClient Tutorial][2] and [OK Http client][3] with good tutorial - [A Guide to OkHttp][4]. However, I wrote my own Http client that is not widely known but very simple to use. &lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt; The second part is how to parse Json. And for that you can use also 3d party Json parsers. The most popular ones would be [Json Jackson][5] or [Gson][6] (of Google). And again I also wrote my own thin wrapper over Json-Jackson that allows you to parse Json very simply. Here is the code example that uses my own utilities:\r\n\r\n    HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();\r\n    try {\r\n        httpClient.setConnectionUrl(&quot;https://api.nal.usda.gov/fdc/v1/food/1750339?api_key=DEMO_KEY&quot;);\r\n        httpClient.setRequestHeader(&quot;Accept&quot;, &quot;application/json&quot;);\r\n        String jsonResponse = httpClient.sendHttpRequest(HttpClient.HttpMethod.GET);\r\n        Map&lt;String, Object&gt; map = JsonUtils.readObjectFromJsonString(jsonResponse, Map.class);\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;fdcid: &quot; + map.get(&quot;fdcId&quot;));\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;description: &quot; + map.get(&quot;description&quot;));\r\n    } catch (Exception e) {\r\n        System.out.println(httpClient.getLastResponseCode() + &quot; &quot;\r\n                + httpClient.getLastResponseMessage() + TextUtils.getStacktrace(e, false));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf you run this code this would be the output:\r\n\r\n    fdcid: 1750339\r\n    description: Apples, red delicious, with skin, raw\r\n\r\nThe classes `HttpClient`, `JsonUtils`  and `TextUtils` all come as part of MgntUtils Open Source library written and maintained by me.

The most popular are <a href=\"https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.2.x/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apache Http Client</a> with good tutorial - <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/httpclient-guide\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apache HttpClient Tutorial</a> and <a href=\"https://square.github.io/okhttp/4.x/okhttp/okhttp3/-ok-http-client/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OK Http client</a> with good tutorial - <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/guide-to-okhttp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A Guide to OkHttp</a>. However, I wrote my own Http client that is not widely known but very simple to use. <br>\n<br> The second part is how to parse Json. And for that you can use also 3d party Json parsers. The most popular ones would be <a href=\"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Json Jackson</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/google/gson\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gson</a> (of Google). And again I also wrote my own thin wrapper over Json-Jackson that allows you to parse Json very simply. Here is the code example that uses my own utilities:</p>\n<pre><code>HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();\ntry {\n    httpClient.setConnectionUrl(&quot;https://api.nal.usda.gov/fdc/v1/food/1750339?api_key=DEMO_KEY&quot;);\n    httpClient.setRequestHeader(&quot;Accept&quot;, &quot;application/json&quot;);\n    String jsonResponse = httpClient.sendHttpRequest(HttpClient.HttpMethod.GET);\n    Map&lt;String, Object&gt; map = JsonUtils.readObjectFromJsonString(jsonResponse, Map.class);\n    System.out.println(&quot;fdcid: &quot; + map.get(&quot;fdcId&quot;));\n    System.out.println(&quot;description: &quot; + map.get(&quot;description&quot;));\n} catch (Exception e) {\n    System.out.println(httpClient.getLastResponseCode() + &quot; &quot;\n            + httpClient.getLastResponseMessage() + TextUtils.getStacktrace(e, false));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you run this code this would be the output:</p>\n<pre><code>fdcid: 1750339\ndescription: Apples, red delicious, with skin, raw\n</code></pre>\n<p>The classes <code>HttpClient</code>, <code>JsonUtils</code>  and <code>TextUtils</code> all come as part of MgntUtils Open Source library written and maintained by me.

which is why the application is throwing the error of &#39;Unrecognized field &quot;introspection_endpoint&quot;&#39;.\r\n\r\nWhen I looked into the relatively lower version of keycloak-authz-client i.e keycloak-authz-client-3.3.0.Final.jar, I could see that &quot;introspection_endpoint&quot; property is present. So it appears that this property was dropped somewhere in the upper versions such as keycloak-authz-client-4.0.0.Final.jar, keycloak-authz-client-4.0.0.Beta2.jar .etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I thought of using keycloak-spring-boot-starter rather than keycloak-spring-boot-2- and inject the respective version of keycloak adapter BOM. I manually included the following dependencies:-\r\n\r\n```\r\ncompile &quot;org.keycloak:keycloak-spring-boot-starter:3.3.0.Final&quot;\r\ncompile &quot;org.keycloak:keycloak-spring-boot-adapter:3.3.0.Final&quot;\r\ncompile &quot;org.keycloak:keycloak-authz-client:3.3.0.Final&quot;\r\ncompile

&quot;org.keycloak:keycloak-common:3.3.0.Final&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut now when I am trying to run the spring boot application, it exits with the following

To do this, we downloaded the WinRun4J open source application.  Following the winrun4j directions, I&#39;ve performed the following:\r\n\r\n    1) Created a new folder:  E:\\Custom_Apps\r\n    2) Copied the WinRun4J64 executable to the new folder\r\n    3) Renamed the WinRun4J64 executable to OC4J_WebServer\r\n    4) Copied the WinRun4J icon to the new folder and renamed it OC4J_WebServer\r\n    5) Created an initialization file in the E:\\Custom_Apps folder named OC4J_WebServer.\r\n\r\nThe initialization file contains the following lines:\r\n\r\n    &gt;working.directory=E:\\Custom_Apps\\working\\\r\n    &gt;vm.location=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_65\\jre\\bin\\server\\jvm.dll\r\n    &gt;service.class=%J2EE_HOME%\\oc4j.jar\r\n    &gt;service.id=OC4JWebServer\r\n    &gt;service.name=WinRun4J_OC4J_Service\r\n    &gt;service.description=the OC4J Web Server service launched using winRun4J64.\r\n    &gt;classpath.1=%JAVA_HOME%\\*.jar\r\n    &gt;classpath.2=e:\\OC4J\\*.jar\r\n    &gt;classpath.3=e:\\Software\\WinRun4J\\winrun4j\\\r\n    &gt;vmarg.1=-Xdebug\r\n    &gt;vmarg.2=-Xnoagent\r\n    &gt;vmarg.3=-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8787,server=y,suspend=n\r\n\r\nI executed the following commands at the command line to bind the icon and initializaton files to the executable:\r\n\r\n   `RCEDIT64.exe /I OC4J_WebServer.exe OC4J_WebServer.ico`\r\n   `RCEDIT64.exe /N OC4J_WebServer.exe OC4J_WebServer.ini`\r\n\r\nFinally, I ran the `OC4J_WebServer.exe --WinRun4J64:RegisterService` command to create the Windows service.

However, when I try and run my action in my Unomi plugin, it immediately says there&#39;s no graalvm polyglot class available (expected).\n\nAfter some googling, I stumbled upon an [existing GitHub issue][6], and followed [the suggestion][2] to add `org.graalvm.polyglot` to `org.osgi.framework.system.packages.extra`. This almost worked, but now when I try and run my action in my Unomi plugin, I get a `PolyglotIllegalArgumentException: A language with id &#39;js&#39; is not installed. Installed languages are: [].` I then tried adding all of the classes I attempted including in the pom above in this manner, but it continued to return the same error. \n\nI&#39;m unsure of where to go from here. I&#39;m guessing my inexperience with Maven is going to point out that this is a stupid problem, though after a lot of searching it appears that the small amount of content available around running GraalVM on OSGi all points to it possibly not working - though I have to imagine this is possible. My thoughts on a potential solution are \n\n 1. I&#39;ve configured my Maven pom poorly, and there&#39;s a way to solve this through a properly configured pom\n 2. I need to specify additional system packages in `org.osgi.framework.system.packages.extra` beyond the single `org.graalvm.polyglot`, but am unsure of how to move forward here.\n\nAny assistance is beyond appreciated!\n\n  [1]: https://unomi.apache.org/manual/latest/index.html#_writing_plugins\n  [2]: https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/789#issuecomment-439009866  \n  [3]: https://github.com/kressaty/unomi/pull/1\n  [4]: https://github.com/graalvm/graal-js-jdk11-maven-demo\n  [5]: https://github.com/kressaty/unomi/pull/1/files#diff-f5e8c2e754c77f586504380d9f9609c8\n  [6]: https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/789\n  [7]: https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/polyglot/#start-language-java\n  [8]: https://gist.github.com/kressaty/b015e6a6537277b868d0ba05ac891d7e\n","title":"How do I add GraalVM Polyglot code (Java running Javascript) support in an OSGi (Karaf) Module","body":"<h2>My Goal:</h2>\n<p>I'm building a &quot;<a href=\"https://unomi.apache.org/manual/latest/index.html#_writing_plugins\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">plugin</a>&quot; for Apache Unomi, which seems to be a pretty standard set of Karaf / OSGi services.

be required to choose whether they want to open a patient account or a doctor account. For the patient account option, I managed to see the layout when I run the app but when I try to pick the doctor account option, the app does not show the layout. This is weird considering the fact that the code does not show any error, even the logcat too shows the process is perfectly fine.</p>\n<p>Here is the activity class and the xml for the doctor account option, also with the main class.
