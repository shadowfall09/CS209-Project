In Java 11, JavaFX was removed from the SDK. It is now in its own separate module If you want to use it in your application, you will need to include it.\nHere is a detailed explanation of how to get and include it.\n<a href=\"https://blog.idrsolutions.com/using-javafx-with-java-11/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://blog.idrsolutions.com/using-javafx-with-java-11/</a></p>\n<p>About your question: You cannot expect anybody to debug your code. I've checked your code unfortunately it is a mess and needs to be rewritten.\nFor example:\nHandleClientGUI is not needed at all.\nClientGUI should not implement Runnable --&gt; rename run() method to init() or something and invoke that method.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":26502178,"reputation":1,"user_id":20138935,"display_name":"tthejoarmy"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":186,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1664702084,"creation_date":1664647173,"question_id":73920610,"body_markdown":"heyho,\r\nI&#39;m new in coding so sorry if this is obvious or whatever.\r\nI tried to code a client/server application.

It looks like the output from `Date.toString()` (`Date` being the old-fashioned class used for times before Java 8). So it’s probably in English because that `toString` method always produced English output. So if your locale is not an English-speaking one, parsing is deemed to fail, and I believe this is the reason why it did. In this case it’s appropriate to use `Locale.ROOT` for the locale neutral English-speaking locale. A way to say “don’t apply any locale specific processing here”.\r\n\r\nYour string contains a time zone abbreviation, EDT, which is part of identifying a unique point in time, so you will want to pick up this part of the information too.

This is encapsulated in sun.misc.SharedSecrets. This class provides access to instances of a number of public interfaces, such as sun.misc.JavaLangAccess. The actual implementations are provided as inner classes in the appropriate package e.g. java.lang, where it has access to the private and package-private variables and methods within.\r\n\r\nSay that you have API classes scattered across multiple packages. You want them to be able to access each other&#39;s internals, without exposing them to end-users. What do you do?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Without Java Modules ###\r\n\r\n1. Create an &quot;internal&quot; package that will be omitted from the public Javadoc (e.g. **com.example.internal**)\r\n2. Declare one or more interfaces in the internal package, referencing the private functionality you are trying to access.\r\n3. Declare a public class (e.g. **SharedSecrets**) in the internal package to hold implementations of these interfaces.\r\n4. Use static initializers in your API classes to get/set implementations of these interfaces from/to **SharedSecrets**.\r\n5. Now, API classes can access each other&#39;s internals by piggybacking through a trusted intermediary (**SharedSecrets**).\r\n\r\n### Option 2: With Java Modules ###\r\n\r\n1. Say you have two modules: **main** and **test**, and you want **test** to access private or package-private methods and fields inside **main**.\r\n2. Declare a public class **SharedSecrets** inside the main module, in a non-exported package. For example: **main.internal.SharedSecrets**.\r\n3. In **main**&#39;s **module-info.java**, add `exports main.internal to test`.\r\n4. Meaning, the package **main.internal** will only be accessible to module **test**.\r\n5. Because **SharedSecrets** is public, anyone in **main** (even from different packages) can push bridge functions or fields into it. It actually works the other way as well (**test** can push bridge functions into **main**) but I&#39;ve never needed to do this to date.\r\n6. Now, anytime **test** wishes to access the internals of **main**, it simply piggybacks its calls through **SharedSecrets**.\r\n\r\nThis solution is especially nice because the resulting Javadoc and IDE auto-complete will look a lot cleaner.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcrete Example\r\n---\r\n\r\n    External Users\r\n    ├── external\r\n    │   └── EndUser.java\r\n    └── module-info.java\r\n\r\n    Library\r\n    ├── library\r\n    │   ├── character\r\n    │   │   └── Character.java\r\n    │   ├── story\r\n    │   │   └── Story.java\r\n    │   └── internal\r\n    │       ├── SharedSecrets.java\r\n    │       └── SecretCharacter.java\r\n    └── module-info.java\r\n\r\n* We want to expose `Character`&#39;s internals to `Story` without `EndUser` gaining access.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nEnd-user code\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**external/EndUser.java:**\r\n    \r\n    package external;\r\n    \r\n    import library.character.Character;\r\n    import library.story.Story;\r\n    \r\n    public class EndUser\r\n    {\r\n    \tpublic static void main(String[] args)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tStory story = new Story();\r\n    \t\tstory.introduce(Character.HARRY_POTTER);\r\n    \t\tstory.introduce(Character.RON_WEASLEY);\r\n    \t\tstory.introduce(Character.HERMIONE_GRANGER);\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**module-info.java:**\r\n    \r\n    module external\r\n    {\r\n    \trequires library;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nLibrary code\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**library/story/Story.java**\r\n\r\n    package library.story;\r\n    \r\n    import library.character.Character;\r\n    import library.internal.SecretCharacter;\r\n    import library.internal.SharedSecrets;\r\n    \r\n    public final class Story\r\n    {\r\n        private static final SharedSecrets sharedSecrets =\r\n          SharedSecrets.INSTANCE;\r\n\r\n    \tpublic void introduce(Character character)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tSystem.out.println(character.name() + &quot; enters the room and says: &quot; + \r\n              sharedSecrets.secretCharacter.getPhrase(character));\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**library/character/Character.java:**\r\n\r\n    package library.character;\r\n    \r\n    import library.internal.SecretCharacter;\r\n    import library.internal.SharedSecrets;\r\n    \r\n    public enum Character\r\n    {\r\n    \tHARRY_POTTER\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\t@Override\r\n    \t\tString getPhrase()\r\n    \t\t{\r\n    \t\t\treturn &quot;Your bird, there was nothing I could do.

However, if there is global data that needs to be shared, that is a bit more complicated. You need to use the server file system to share the data, as there is no memory sharing between java and php (at least that I know of). Since both java and php can read and write files, there is no problem writing the code. However, there is the problem of concurrency. If it is possible for several pieces of code to access and modify the global data at exactly the same time, then you have to worry about that, because otherwise data changes could be lost or the data could get corrupted. So the easiest solution, as suggested above, is to use a database, because the database software takes care of the concurrency for you.
