Am I forced to implement the API in this project (I don't think this is the answer)</p>\n<p>As you can read on the title, I am having issues with my Service Interface and the Bean's in the configuration class.</p>\n<p>The error I am getting is the following</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Field alumnService in com.project.shareitAPI.api.controller.AlumnController required a bean of type 'com.project.shareitAPI.api.service.AlumnService' that could not be found.</p>\n<p>The injection point has the following annotations:\n- @org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired(required=true)</p>\n<p>Action:</p>\n<p>Consider defining a bean of type 'com.project.shareitAPI.api.service.AlumnService' in your configuration.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I have a Service Interface like this</p>\n<pre><code>@Service\npublic interface AlumnService {\n\n    AlumnDTO postNewAlumn(AlumnDTO body);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>A Controller</p>\n<pre><code>@RestController\n@RequestMapping(&quot;api/v1/alumns&quot;)\n@Slf4j\npublic class AlumnController {\n\n    @Autowired\n    AlumnService alumnService;\n\n    @PostMapping(path = &quot;/new&quot;)\n    public ResponseEntity&lt;AlumnDTO&gt; postNewAlumn(\n            @RequestBody AlumnDTO body\n    ) {\n        return ResponseEntity.ok(alumnService.postNewAlumn(body));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And here is the configuration class with the @Bean that is requesting but I know this ain't right.</p>\n<pre><code>@Configuration\npublic class ShareItConfiguration {\n\n    @Bean\n    AlumnService alumnService(){\n        return new AlumnService() {\n            @Override\n            public AlumnDTO postNewAlumn(AlumnDTO body) {\n                return null;\n            }\n        };\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Maybe I am not understanding the concepts of how an API works or is structured, but how should it be then? Because I don't understand the error.</p>\n<p>Thanks for the help and knowledge!</p>\n<h2>Edit</h2>\n<p>Here is the project structure just if you need to know</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XG8ng.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Project Structure</a></p>\n<h2>Edit2</h2>\n<p>Log of all the Beans at startup</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wTyIz.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">enter image description here</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","firebase","google-cloud-firestore","mockito"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":6819231,"reputation":132861,"user_id":5246885,"accept_rate":78,"display_name":"Alex Mamo"},"score":0,"creation_date":1678524945,"post_id":75701154,"comment_id":133552297,"body_markdown":"As far as I can see, that is a real object and not a mock object, right?","body":"As far as I can see, that is a real object and not a mock object, right?"},{"owner":{"account_id":23840128,"reputation":1,"user_id":17845292,"display_name":"DvDev"},"score":0,"creation_date":1678538309,"post_id":75701154,"comment_id":133554008,"body_markdown":"That&#39;s the point, how to do a mock on this real object, and give a value for each lines, to not get a NPE !?","body":"That&#39;s the point, how to do a mock on this real object, and give a value for each lines, to not get a NPE !?"}],"owner":{"account_id":23840128,"reputation":1,"user_id":17845292,"display_name":"DvDev"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1678538242,"creation_date":1678483492,"question_id":75701154,"body_markdown":"I used this code in a repository, but now that i want to do unit test.

I am very new to android and Java and if anyone would help me out with an example or clear code for achieving that that I would appreciate it.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","svn","version-control","revision","version-control-keywords"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":919269,"reputation":95186,"user_id":960558,"display_name":"Lazy Badger"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1678537191,"creation_date":1678537191,"answer_id":75704875,"question_id":75585787,"body_markdown":"&gt; What&#39;s the best practice to do it, considering that any file may be the latest committed?\r\n\r\nJust don&#39;t use file-specific keywords and have different sources of repository-wide information.\r\n* In case of &quot;pure&quot; SVN, you can, f.e., rely on [`svn info`][1] output for (preferrable clean) WC or even remote repository-URL, maybe on XML-output\r\n* If you can have TortoiseSVN, you have [SubWCRev][2] with it, with can do all dirty job of extracting all needed data from WC for you (you can even run it from post-commit hook and have always correct data-file automatically)\r\n\r\n&gt; Also, is there a keyword for the commit datetime?\r\n\r\nAlot of.\r\n\r\nFrom a box you [have][3] Date|LastChangedDate, part of Id keyword is also date in different, than in Date, format.\r\n\r\nStarting from SVN 1.8, you can define own custom keywords and have own date-string for your needs\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.ref.svn.c.info.html\r\n  [2]: https://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-subwcrev.html\r\n  [3]: https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.advanced.props.special.keywords.html","title":"Best practice to store Subversion revision info app-wise","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>What's the best practice to do it, considering that any file may be the latest committed?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just don't use file-specific keywords and have different sources of repository-wide information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In case of &quot;pure&quot; SVN, you can, f.e., rely on <a href=\"https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.ref.svn.c.info.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>svn info</code></a> output for (preferrable clean) WC or even remote repository-URL, maybe on XML-output</li>\n<li>If you can have TortoiseSVN, you have <a href=\"https://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-subwcrev.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SubWCRev</a> with it, with can do all dirty job of extracting all needed data from WC for you (you can even run it from post-commit hook and have always correct data-file automatically)</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, is there a keyword for the commit datetime?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Alot of.</p>\n<p>From a box you <a href=\"https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.advanced.props.special.keywords.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">have</a> Date|LastChangedDate, part of Id keyword is also date in different, than in Date, format.</p>\n<p>Starting from SVN 1.8, you can define own custom keywords and have own date-string for your needs</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":2215465,"reputation":3827,"user_id":1956207,"accept_rate":70,"display_name":"Hikari"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1678537191,"creation_date":1677533680,"question_id":75585787,"body_markdown":"Subversion has the `$Rev$` keyword, that&#39;s replaced by in example `$Rev: 1843 $` when a file with that keyword is committed.

To see the actual test result, click on the &quot;Result&quot; tab:\r\n\r\n[![GWC test result][1]][1]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Update:** An alternative and maybe even better solution than before, if you want to mock the `AccountService`, assuming that the `Report report` variable is actually used later, as the source code comment implies, would be:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Report {\r\n  public void doSomething() { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  public ProcessRequest request(String accountId, Item item) {\r\n    try {\r\n      Account acct = this.accountService.findUser(accountId);\r\n      this.inventoryService.check(item);\r\n    }\r\n    catch (CustomInvalidExceptionA | CustomInvalidExceptionB ex) {\r\n      Report report = this.reportService.reportRequest(accountId, item, ex.getClass());\r\n      System.out.println(&quot;ERROR: &quot; + ex.getClass());\r\n      // Other logic using report object\r\n      report.doSomething();\r\n    }\r\n    return new ProcessRequest();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can test it like this, mocking everything but the class under test:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass SomeHelperTest extends Specification {\r\n  SomeHelper helper\r\n\r\n  def setup() {\r\n    helper = new SomeHelper()\r\n    helper.accountService = Mock(AccountService)\r\n    helper.reportService = Mock(ReportService)\r\n    helper.inventoryService = Mock(InventoryService)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  def &quot;make sure if the accountService findUser failed, then reportService reportRequest is called once&quot;() {\r\n    given:\r\n    helper.accountService.findUser(_) &gt;&gt; {\r\n      throw new CustomInvalidExceptionA()\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    when:\r\n    helper.request(&quot;123&quot;, Mock(Item))\r\n\r\n    then:\r\n    noExceptionThrown()\r\n\r\n    then:\r\n    1 * helper.reportService.reportRequest(*_) &gt;&gt; _\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that in this case, the ` &gt;&gt; _` at the end of the last line is really essential in order to make the `reportRequest(*_)` method return a non-`null` stub response rather than the mock default of `null`.

Once you have that set to the correct maximum value, you should look at:\r\n\r\n    server.tomcat.keep-alive-timeout\r\n\r\n- which decides how long a keep-alive session is kept around for.  Reducing this time (in msec, not in seconds) will prioritize clients that are sending requests frequently over clients that are not.  The default is 60000 (1 minute).\r\n\r\nPS You haven&#39;t said which webserver you are using, but the default is Tomcat, so I assume you are using Tomcat, otherwise there are similar settings for eg Jetty.\r\n\r\nThe above should solve your problem, but if it does not, then you can still configure failover logic as follows:\r\n\r\n      // 5 attempts, connect timeout 5 seconds, receive timeout 20 seconds (per attempt)\r\n      // Should take about 30 seconds to fail if the server is completely down\r\n      final RetryStrategy retryStrategy = new RetryStrategy();\r\n      retryStrategy.setMaxNumberOfRetries(5);\r\n      retryStrategy.setDelayBetweenRetries(1000);\r\n      FailoverFeature failoverFeature = new FailoverFeature();\r\n      failoverFeature.setStrategy(retryStrategy);\r\n      failoverFeature.setTargetSelector(new FailoverTargetSelector(address));\r\n      jaxWsProxyFactoryBean.getFeatures().add(failoverFeature);\r\n      serviceBean = jaxWsProxyFactoryBean.create();\r\n\r\n      HTTPConduitConfigurer httpConduitConfigurer = (name, address, c) -&gt;\r\n      {\r\n         HTTPClientPolicy httpClientPolicy = new HTTPClientPolicy();\r\n         httpClientPolicy.setConnectionTimeout(5000);\r\n         httpClientPolicy.setReceiveTimeout(20000);\r\n         c.setClient(httpClientPolicy);\r\n      };\r\n\r\n      Client client = ClientProxy.getClient(serviceBean);\r\n      client.getBus().setExtension(httpConduitConfigurer, HTTPConduitConfigurer.class);","title":"Web Service Client - Multiple HTTP Keep Alive Connection to same destination","body":"<p>I assume that you mean that when you enable keep-alive, Tomcat gets overloaded because there are too many sockets.

boils down to the inability of Apache to initialize the User model, or this is what the error is telling me. However, the Controller is also not an abstract method in any sense, and neither is such a method used anywhere in the project.\r\n\r\nFor the record, the project builds successfully:\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThings I&#39;ve tried include the following:\r\n\r\n- [Specify tomcat version](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34918138/unable-to-deploy-to-server-running-tomcat)\r\n\r\n- [authentication issue,](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71043068/errors-deploying-spring-boot-war-to-apache-tomcat) but for how this is not relevant to the project (still at a demo stage)\r\n\r\n- [what seemed the most promising](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65955299/problem-with-production-build-of-spring-boot-and-react-app), change BrowserRouter to HashRouter and set the homepage to a period, but that led to nothing.\r\n\r\n- Arrange the context path in the application.properties file, but this is not actually meant for a production version of this app:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# these configuration details cannot be used for external Tomcat, they only work for the embedded version.\r\n#server.servlet.context-path=/\r\n#spring.mvc.servlet.path=/backend-3\r\n```\r\n\r\n- changed `@RestController` to `@Controller` in the `UserController` file.\r\n\r\n- [deploying the project on an external Tomcat](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53885604/not-able-to-deploy-springboot-application-in-an-external-tomcat), which essentially boiled down to having the provided scope in the pom.xml file.\r\n\r\n- Another suggestion i saw somewhere was to put `@Autowired` on the constructor in the model, but that has no impact on the outcome, and seems neither here, nor there. Otherwise, the constructors is your typical fields, getters/setters, constructor, blank constructor and toString.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\n - Another thing that I tried was to put the name of the built project, `backend`, as a part of the routing in the `App.js` file, but that was not successful; that was based on the last example connected at the top of the question. I don&#39;t think that should be relevant for frontend routing, however?\r\n\r\n**UPDATE - MAR 10, 2023**\r\n\r\nThere is no version conflict between the version of Apache Tomcat and Java 11, which I&#39;m using:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to start after removing the forward slashes from the last question in the index.html file on the static paths and that prevents Apache Tomcat from finding the initial path; seems to be another pathing problem.\r\n\r\n    &lt;!doctype html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n        &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width,initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;link rel=&quot;shortcut icon&quot; href=&quot;/favicon.ico&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;title&gt;React App&lt;/title&gt;\r\n        &lt;link href=&quot;static/css/main.9a0fe4f1.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n        &lt;div id=&quot;root&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;static/js/main.f55352b1.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;/body&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\nI could not find this particular trace anywhere else, but the details of it also don&#39;t make the most sense to me in the context of the project.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any insight!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/CDRVR.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/ccMuG.png","title":"Tomcat 9 SpringBoot + ReactJS without JavaFX fails to start - javafx.application.Application is abstract","body":"<p>On the heels of a <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75540890/why-cannot-a-compiled-spring-boot-react-project-find-react-build-files\">previous question</a> I asked about integrating Spring Boot and React together, I used that solution to resolve Spring Boot finding React build files, as well as displaying information from API requests.</p>\n<p>Another unexpected issue has formed up - Apache Tomcat fails to deploy the <code>war</code> file that resulted from these changes.

boils down to the inability of Apache to initialize the User model, or this is what the error is telling me.

Otherwise, the constructors is your typical fields, getters/setters, constructor, blank constructor and toString.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Another thing that I tried was to put the name of the built project, <code>backend</code>, as a part of the routing in the <code>App.js</code> file, but that was not successful; that was based on the last example connected at the top of the question. I don't think that should be relevant for frontend routing, however?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>UPDATE - MAR 10, 2023</strong></p>\n<p>There is no version conflict between the version of Apache Tomcat and Java 11, which I'm using:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ccMuG.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ccMuG.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>The issue seems to start after removing the forward slashes from the last question in the index.html file on the static paths and that prevents Apache Tomcat from finding the initial path; seems to be another pathing problem.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;meta
