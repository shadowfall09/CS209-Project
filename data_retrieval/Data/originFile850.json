They&#39;re usually used to do things like enforce closing of streams. This is also more relevant due to this line:\r\n\r\n&gt; Is there a design pattern to handle these kind of situations?\r\n\r\nThe idea is you give the thing that does the &quot;executing around&quot; some class to do somethings with. You&#39;ll probably use `Runnable` but it&#39;s not necessary. *(`Runnable` makes the most sense and you&#39;ll see why soon.)* In your `StopWatch` class add some method like this\r\n\r\n    public long measureAction(Runnable r) {\r\n        start();\r\n        r.run();\r\n        stop();\r\n        return getTime();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou would then call it like this\r\n\r\n    StopWatch stopWatch = new StopWatch();\r\n    Runnable r = new Runnable() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void run() {\r\n            // Put some tasks here you want to measure.\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n    long time = stopWatch.measureAction(r);\r\n\r\nThis makes it fool proof. You don&#39;t have to worry about handling stop before start or people forgetting to call one and not the other, etc. The reason `Runnable` is nice is because\r\n\r\n1. Standard java class, not your own or third party\r\n2. End users can put whatever they need in the `Runnable` to be done.\r\n\r\n(If you were using it to enforce stream closing then you could put the actions that need to be done with a database connection inside so the end user doesn&#39;t need to worry about how to open and close it and you simultaneously force them to close it properly.)\r\n\r\nIf you wanted, you could make some `StopWatchWrapper` instead leave `StopWatch` unmodified. You could also make `measureAction(Runnable)` not return a time and make `getTime()` public instead.\r\n\r\nThe Java 8 way to calling it is even simpler\r\n\r\n    StopWatch stopWatch = new StopWatch();\r\n    long time = stopWatch.measureAction(() - &gt; {/* Measure stuff here */});\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; **A third (hopefully final) thought:** it seems what the interviewer was looking for and what is being upvoted the most is throwing exceptions based on state (e.g., if `stop()` is called before `start()` or `start()` after `stop()`). This is a fine practice and in fact, depending on the methods in `StopWatch` having a visibility other than private/protected, it&#39;s probably better to have than not have. My one issue with this is that *throwing exceptions alone will not **enforce** a method call sequence.*\r\n\r\n&gt; For example, consider this:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;     class StopWatch {\r\n&gt;         boolean started = false;\r\n&gt;         boolean stopped = false;\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;         // ...\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;         public void start() {\r\n&gt;             if (started) {\r\n&gt;                 throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;Already started!&quot;);\r\n&gt;             }\r\n&gt;             started = true;\r\n&gt;             // ...\r\n&gt;         }\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;         public void stop() {\r\n&gt;             if (!started) {\r\n&gt;                 throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;Not yet started!&quot;);\r\n&gt;             }\r\n&gt;             if (stopped) {\r\n&gt;                 throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;Already stopped!&quot;);\r\n&gt;             }\r\n&gt;             stopped = true;\r\n&gt;             // ...\r\n&gt;         }\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;         public long getTime() {\r\n&gt;             if (!started) {\r\n&gt;                 throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;Not yet started!&quot;);\r\n&gt;             }\r\n&gt;             if (!stopped) {\r\n&gt;                 throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;Not yet stopped!&quot;);\r\n&gt;             }\r\n&gt;             stopped = true;\r\n&gt;             // ...\r\n&gt;         }\r\n&gt;     }\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Just because it&#39;s throwing `IllegalStateException` doesn&#39;t mean that the proper sequence is enforced, **it just means improper sequences are denied** (and I think we can all agree exceptions are annoying, luckily this is not a checked exception).\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; The only way I know to truly enforce that the methods are called correctly is to do it yourself with the execute around pattern or the other suggestions that do things like return `RunningStopWatch` and `StoppedStopWatch` that I presume have only one method, but this seems overly complex (and OP mentioned that the interface couldn&#39;t be changed, admittedly the non-wrapper suggestion I made does this though). So to the best of my knowledge there&#39;s no way to ***enforce*** the proper order without modifying the interface or adding more classes.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; I guess it really depends on what people define &quot;enforce a method call sequence&quot; to mean.

They're usually used to do things like enforce closing of streams. This is also more relevant due to this line:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is there a design pattern to handle these kind of situations?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The idea is you give the thing that does the \"executing around\" some class to do somethings with. You'll probably use <code>Runnable</code> but it's not necessary. <em>(<code>Runnable</code> makes the most sense and you'll see why soon.)</em> In your <code>StopWatch</code> class add some method like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>public long measureAction(Runnable r) {\n    start();\n    r.run();\n    stop();\n    return getTime();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You would then call it like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>StopWatch stopWatch = new StopWatch();\nRunnable r = new Runnable() {\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        // Put some tasks here you want to measure.\n    }\n};\nlong time = stopWatch.measureAction(r);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This makes it fool proof. You don't have to worry about handling stop before start or people forgetting to call one and not the other, etc. The reason <code>Runnable</code> is nice is because</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Standard java class, not your own or third party</li>\n<li>End users can put whatever they need in the <code>Runnable</code> to be done.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(If you were using it to enforce stream closing then you could put the actions that need to be done with a database connection inside so the end user doesn't need to worry about how to open and close it and you simultaneously force them to close it properly.)</p>\n\n<p>If you wanted, you could make some <code>StopWatchWrapper</code> instead leave <code>StopWatch</code> unmodified. You could also make <code>measureAction(Runnable)</code> not return a time and make <code>getTime()</code> public instead.</p>\n\n<p>The Java 8 way to calling it is even simpler</p>\n\n<pre><code>StopWatch stopWatch = new StopWatch();\nlong time = stopWatch.measureAction(() - &gt; {/* Measure stuff here */});\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>A third (hopefully final) thought:</strong> it seems what the interviewer was looking for and what is being upvoted the most is throwing exceptions based on state (e.g., if <code>stop()</code> is called before <code>start()</code> or <code>start()</code> after <code>stop()</code>). This is a fine practice and in fact, depending on the methods in <code>StopWatch</code> having a visibility other than private/protected, it's probably better to have than not have. My one issue with this is that <em>throwing exceptions alone will not <strong>enforce</strong> a method call sequence.</em></p>\n  \n  <p>For example, consider this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class StopWatch {\n    boolean started = false;\n    boolean stopped = false;\n\n    // ...\n\n    public void start() {\n        if (started) {\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Already started!\");\n        }\n        started = true;\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    public void stop() {\n        if (!started) {\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Not yet started!\");\n        }\n        if (stopped) {\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Already stopped!\");\n        }\n        stopped = true;\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    public long getTime() {\n        if (!started) {\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Not yet started!\");\n        }\n        if (!stopped) {\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Not yet stopped!\");\n        }\n        stopped = true;\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>Just because it's throwing <code>IllegalStateException</code> doesn't mean that the proper sequence is enforced, <strong>it just means improper sequences are denied</strong> (and I think we can all agree exceptions are annoying, luckily this is not a checked exception).</p>\n  \n  <p>The only way I know to truly enforce that the methods are called correctly is to do it yourself with the execute around pattern or the other suggestions that do things like return <code>RunningStopWatch</code> and <code>StoppedStopWatch</code> that I presume have only one method, but this seems overly complex (and OP mentioned that the interface couldn't be changed, admittedly the non-wrapper suggestion I made does this though). So to the best of my knowledge there's no way to <strong><em>enforce</em></strong> the proper order without modifying the interface or adding more classes.</p>\n  \n  <p>I guess it really depends on what people define \"enforce a method call sequence\" to mean. If only the exceptions are thrown then the below compiles</p>\n\n<pre><code>StopWatch stopWatch = new StopWatch();\nstopWatch.getTime();\nstopWatch.stop();\nstopWatch.start();\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>True it won't <em>run</em>, but it just seems so much simpler to hand in a <code>Runnable</code> and make those methods private, let the other one relax and handle the pesky details yourself.

(_Don&#39;t forget to add a `fail()` assertion before the `catch` block_)\r\n\r\n_Regardless of Junit 4 or JUnit 5._\r\n\r\n**the long story**\r\n\r\nIt is possible to write yourself a _do it yourself_ `try`-`catch` block or use the JUnit tools (`@Test(expected = ...)` or the `@Rule ExpectedException` JUnit rule feature).\r\n\r\nBut these ways are not so elegant and don&#39;t mix well _readability wise_ with other tools. Moreover, JUnit tooling does have some pitfalls.\r\n\r\n1. The `try`-`catch` block you have to write the block around the tested behavior and write the assertion in the catch block, that may be fine but many find that this style interrupts the reading flow of a test. Also, you need to write an `Assert.fail` at the end of the `try` block. Otherwise, the test may miss one side of the assertions; _PMD_, _findbugs_ or _Sonar_ will spot such issues.\r\n\r\n2. The `@Test(expected = ...)` feature is interesting as you can write less code and then writing this test is supposedly less prone to coding errors. **But** this approach is lacking in some areas.\r\n    * If the test needs to check additional things on the exception like the cause or the message (good exception messages are really important, having a precise exception type may not be enough). \r\n    * Also as the expectation is placed around in the method, depending on how the tested code is written then the wrong part of the test code can throw the exception, leading to false-positive test and I&#39;m not sure that _PMD_, _findbugs_ or _Sonar_ will give hints on such code.\r\n\r\n            @Test(expected = WantedException.class)\r\n            public void call2_should_throw_a_WantedException__not_call1() {\r\n                // init tested\r\n                tested.call1(); // may throw a WantedException\r\n    \r\n                // call to be actually tested\r\n                tested.call2(); // the call that is supposed to raise an exception\r\n            }\r\n\r\n3. The `ExpectedException` rule is also an attempt to fix the previous caveats, but it feels a bit awkward to use as it uses an expectation style, _EasyMock_ users know very well this style. It might be convenient for some, but if you follow _Behaviour Driven Development_ (BDD) or _Arrange Act Assert_ (AAA) principles the `ExpectedException` rule won&#39;t fit in those writing style. Aside from that it may suffer from the same issue as the `@Test` way, depending on where you place the expectation.\r\n\r\n\r\n        @Rule ExpectedException thrown = ExpectedException.none()\r\n\r\n        @Test\r\n        public void call2_should_throw_a_WantedException__not_call1() {\r\n            // expectations\r\n            thrown.expect(WantedException.class);\r\n            thrown.expectMessage(&quot;boom&quot;);\r\n\r\n            // init tested\r\n            tested.call1(); // may throw a WantedException\r\n    \r\n            // call to be actually tested\r\n            tested.call2(); // the call that is supposed to raise an exception\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    Even the expected exception is placed before the test statement, it breaks your reading flow if the tests follow BDD or AAA.\r\n\r\n    Also, see this [comment][1] issue on JUnit of the author of `ExpectedException`. [JUnit 4.13-beta-2][2] even deprecates this mechanism:\r\n\r\n    &gt; [Pull request #1519][3]: Deprecate ExpectedException\r\n    &gt; \r\n    &gt; The method Assert.assertThrows provides a nicer way for verifying exceptions. In addition, the use of ExpectedException is error-prone when used with other rules like TestWatcher because the order of rules is important in that case.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo these above options have all their load of caveats, and clearly not immune to coder errors.\r\n\r\n4. There&#39;s a project I became aware of after creating this answer that looks promising, it&#39;s [**catch-exception**][4].\r\n\r\n    As the description of the project says, it let a coder write in a fluent line of code catching the exception and offer this exception for the latter assertion. And you can use any assertion library like [Hamcrest][5] or [AssertJ][6].\r\n    \r\n    A rapid example taken from the home page : \r\n    \r\n        // given: an empty list\r\n        List myList = new ArrayList();\r\n        \r\n        // when: we try to get the first element of the list\r\n        when(myList).get(1);\r\n        \r\n        // then: we expect an IndexOutOfBoundsException\r\n        then(caughtException())\r\n                .isInstanceOf(IndexOutOfBoundsException.class)\r\n                .hasMessage(&quot;Index: 1, Size: 0&quot;) \r\n                .hasNoCause();\r\n    \r\n    As you can see the code is really straightforward, you catch the exception on a specific line, the `then` API is an alias that will use AssertJ APIs (similar to using `assertThat(ex).hasNoCause()...`). _At some point the project relied on FEST-Assert the ancestor of AssertJ_. **EDIT:** It seems the project is brewing a Java 8 Lambdas support.\r\n    \r\n    Currently, this library has two shortcomings : \r\n      * At the time of this writing, it is noteworthy to say this library is based on Mockito 1.x as it creates a mock of the tested object behind the scene. As Mockito is still not updated **this library cannot work with final classes or final methods**. And even if it was based on Mockito 2 in the current version, this would require to declare a global mock maker (`inline-mock-maker`), something that may not what you want, as this mock maker has different drawbacks that the regular mock maker.\r\n\r\n      * It requires yet another test dependency.\r\n    \r\n    These issues won&#39;t apply once the library supports lambdas. However, the functionality will be duplicated by the AssertJ toolset.\r\n\r\n    **Taking all into account if you don&#39;t want to use the catch-exception tool, I will recommend the old good way of the `try`-`catch` block, at least up to the JDK7. And for JDK 8 users you might prefer to use AssertJ as it offers may more than just asserting exceptions.**\r\n\r\n5. With the JDK8, lambdas enter the test scene, and they have proved to be an interesting way to assert exceptional behaviour. AssertJ has been updated to provide a nice fluent API to assert exceptional behaviour.\r\n\r\n    And a sample test with [AssertJ][7] :\r\n    \r\n        @Test\r\n        public void test_exception_approach_1() {\r\n            ...\r\n            assertThatExceptionOfType(IOException.class)\r\n                    .isThrownBy(() -&gt; someBadIOOperation())\r\n                    .withMessage(&quot;boom!&quot;); \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Test\r\n        public void test_exception_approach_2() {\r\n            ...\r\n            assertThatThrownBy(() -&gt; someBadIOOperation())\r\n                    .isInstanceOf(Exception.class)\r\n                    .hasMessageContaining(&quot;boom&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Test\r\n        public void test_exception_approach_3() {\r\n            ...\r\n            // when\r\n            Throwable thrown = catchThrowable(() -&gt; someBadIOOperation());\r\n    \r\n            // then\r\n            assertThat(thrown).isInstanceOf(Exception.class)\r\n                              .hasMessageContaining(&quot;boom&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n6.

(<em>Don't forget to add a <code>fail()</code> assertion before the <code>catch</code> block</em>)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Regardless of Junit 4 or JUnit 5.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>the long story</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is possible to write yourself a <em>do it yourself</em> <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code> block or use the JUnit tools (<code>@Test(expected = ...)</code> or the <code>@Rule ExpectedException</code> JUnit rule feature).</p>\n\n<p>But these ways are not so elegant and don't mix well <em>readability wise</em> with other tools. Moreover, JUnit tooling does have some pitfalls.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code> block you have to write the block around the tested behavior and write the assertion in the catch block, that may be fine but many find that this style interrupts the reading flow of a test. Also, you need to write an <code>Assert.fail</code> at the end of the <code>try</code> block. Otherwise, the test may miss one side of the assertions; <em>PMD</em>, <em>findbugs</em> or <em>Sonar</em> will spot such issues.</p></li>\n<li><p>The <code>@Test(expected = ...)</code> feature is interesting as you can write less code and then writing this test is supposedly less prone to coding errors. <strong>But</strong> this approach is lacking in some areas.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If the test needs to check additional things on the exception like the cause or the message (good exception messages are really important, having a precise exception type may not be enough). </li>\n<li><p>Also as the expectation is placed around in the method, depending on how the tested code is written then the wrong part of the test code can throw the exception, leading to false-positive test and I'm not sure that <em>PMD</em>, <em>findbugs</em> or <em>Sonar</em> will give hints on such code.</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Test(expected = WantedException.class)\npublic void call2_should_throw_a_WantedException__not_call1() {\n    // init tested\n    tested.call1(); // may throw a WantedException\n\n    // call to be actually tested\n    tested.call2(); // the call that is supposed to raise an exception\n}\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>The <code>ExpectedException</code> rule is also an attempt to fix the previous caveats, but it feels a bit awkward to use as it uses an expectation style, <em>EasyMock</em> users know very well this style. It might be convenient for some, but if you follow <em>Behaviour Driven Development</em> (BDD) or <em>Arrange Act Assert</em> (AAA) principles the <code>ExpectedException</code> rule won't fit in those writing style. Aside from that it may suffer from the same issue as the <code>@Test</code> way, depending on where you place the expectation.</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Rule ExpectedException thrown = ExpectedException.none()\n\n@Test\npublic void call2_should_throw_a_WantedException__not_call1() {\n    // expectations\n    thrown.expect(WantedException.class);\n    thrown.expectMessage(\"boom\");\n\n    // init tested\n    tested.call1(); // may throw a WantedException\n\n    // call to be actually tested\n    tested.call2(); // the call that is supposed to raise an exception\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Even the expected exception is placed before the test statement, it breaks your reading flow if the tests follow BDD or AAA.</p>\n\n<p>Also, see this <a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/706#issuecomment-21385116\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">comment</a> issue on JUnit of the author of <code>ExpectedException</code>. <a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/4.13-Release-Notes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JUnit 4.13-beta-2</a> even deprecates this mechanism:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/pull/1519\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pull request #1519</a>: Deprecate ExpectedException</p>\n  \n  <p>The method Assert.assertThrows provides a nicer way for verifying exceptions. In addition, the use of ExpectedException is error-prone when used with other rules like TestWatcher because the order of rules is important in that case.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So these above options have all their load of caveats, and clearly not immune to coder errors.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><p>There's a project I became aware of after creating this answer that looks promising, it's <a href=\"https://github.com/Codearte/catch-exception\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>catch-exception</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p>As the description of the project says, it let a coder write in a fluent line of code catching the exception and offer this exception for the latter assertion. And you can use any assertion library like <a href=\"https://github.com/hamcrest/JavaHamcrest\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hamcrest</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AssertJ</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A rapid example taken from the home page : </p>\n\n<pre><code>// given: an empty list\nList myList = new ArrayList();\n\n// when: we try to get the first element of the list\nwhen(myList).get(1);\n\n// then: we expect an IndexOutOfBoundsException\nthen(caughtException())\n        .isInstanceOf(IndexOutOfBoundsException.class)\n        .hasMessage(\"Index: 1, Size: 0\") \n        .hasNoCause();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see the code is really straightforward, you catch the exception on a specific line, the <code>then</code> API is an alias that will use AssertJ APIs (similar to using <code>assertThat(ex).hasNoCause()...</code>). <em>At some point the project relied on FEST-Assert the ancestor of AssertJ</em>. <strong>EDIT:</strong> It seems the project is brewing a Java 8 Lambdas support.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, this library has two shortcomings : </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>At the time of this writing, it is noteworthy to say this library is based on Mockito 1.x as it creates a mock of the tested object behind the scene. As Mockito is still not updated <strong>this library cannot work with final classes or final methods</strong>. And even if it was based on Mockito 2 in the current version, this would require to declare a global mock maker (<code>inline-mock-maker</code>), something that may not what you want, as this mock maker has different drawbacks that the regular mock maker.</p></li>\n<li><p>It requires yet another test dependency.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These issues won't apply once the library supports lambdas. However, the functionality will be duplicated by the AssertJ toolset.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Taking all into account if you don't want to use the catch-exception tool, I will recommend the old good way of the <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code> block, at least up to the JDK7. And for JDK 8 users you might prefer to use AssertJ as it offers may more than just asserting exceptions.</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>With the JDK8, lambdas enter the test scene, and they have proved to be an interesting way to assert exceptional behaviour.
