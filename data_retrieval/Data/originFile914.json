Even when I pick just black-to-black pixels, it still says all is white.</p>\n<pre><code>import java.awt.Dimension;\nimport java.awt.EventQueue;\nimport java.awt.Graphics;\nimport java.awt.Graphics2D;\nimport java.awt.event.MouseEvent;\nimport java.awt.event.MouseListener;\nimport java.awt.image.BufferedImage;\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\nimport javax.imageio.ImageIO;\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\nimport javax.swing.JPanel;\nimport javax.swing.UIManager;\n\npublic class W3_Img_Process_Class_Only extends JPanel {\n    //--------------variables\n    int[][] tog;    int step;\n    String inTitle=&quot;L1&quot;;\n    int imageCount=0;\n    int[] x= new int[2], y= new int[2];\n    int[] black= new int[2]; //-------------if black is 0, then the pixel is black\n    int clr;    int flag=0;\n    \n    private BufferedImage master;\n    private BufferedImage blackWhite;        \n\n    public W3_Img_Process_Class_Only() {\n        //----------------------try/catch for (pure black || pure white)\n        try {\n            master = ImageIO.read(new File(Image_Path));\n            blackWhite = new BufferedImage(master.getWidth(), master.getHeight(), BufferedImage.TYPE_BYTE_BINARY);\n            Graphics2D g2d = blackWhite.createGraphics();\n            g2d.drawImage(master, 0, 0, this);\n            g2d.dispose();\n        }catch (IOException ex) {ex.printStackTrace();}\n        //--------------------------1st and 2nd click point data and color\n            this.addMouseListener(new MouseListener() {\n                int[] isFristEmpty;\n                @Override\n                public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e1) {\n                        int[] temp =new int[3];     //external container so i can get 1st and 2nd separately\n                        temp[0] = (int) e1.getX();\n                        temp[1] = (int) e1.getY();\n                        clr = blackWhite.getRGB(temp[0], temp[1]);\n                        temp[2] = (clr &amp; 0x00ff0000) &gt;&gt; 16;//--------------------bit map to find if red is there or not.\n                        //-------------------------------------------------------since its pure b/w, if red 0, its white.\n                        if(isFristEmpty==null) {\n                            isFristEmpty=temp;\n                            x[0] = temp[0]; y[0] = temp[1]; black[0]=temp[2];//------1st click\n                        }else {\n                            x[1] = temp[0]; y[1] = temp[1]; black[1]=temp[2];//-----2nd click\n                            isFristEmpty=null;  //so the 3rd click is considered 1st click again\n                            flag=1;\n                        }\n                        if (flag==1) {\n                            \n                            System.out.print(&quot;X1: &quot;+x[0]+&quot; &amp; &quot;+&quot;Y1: &quot;+y[0]+&quot; &quot;+&quot;(225 if white): &quot;+black[0]+&quot;\\t&quot;);\n                            System.out.println(&quot;X2: &quot;+x[1]+&quot; &amp; &quot;+&quot;Y2: &quot;+y[1]+&quot; &quot;+&quot;(225 if white): &quot;+black[1]);\n                            counter();\n                        }\n                }\n                @Override   public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {}\n                @Override   public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e) {}\n                @Override   public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e) {}\n                @Override   public void mouseExited(MouseEvent e) {}\n            });\n    }\n    \n    //--------------------------------------------DDA block\n    private void counter() {\n        int dark;\n        if(flag!=1) return;//-------------------to only go to counter method after it takes that 2nd click\n        int dx = (x[1] - x[0]);\n        int dy = (y[1] - y[0]);//---------makes it applicable for both inclinations (we do not have math.abs implies-&gt; -ve goes as -ve)\n        step = Math.abs(dx) &gt; Math.abs(dy) ?

so if you&#39;re doing the second one, you won&#39;t need to specify the @Content type at all (except on the 200 response where you&#39;re returning an empty body, where you&#39;ll want to specify

migrating from Springfox to Springdoc?","body":"<p>You can use</p>\n<pre><code>content = @Content(mediaType =...,schema = @Schema(implementation=...))\n</code></pre>\n<p>You didn't show the rest of your code, but I'm assuming you're returning your ErrorResponse class as json in the 4xx responses?</p>\n<p>If so, I think the spring-doc definition would look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>@ApiResponse(responseCode = &quot;400&quot;, description = &quot;Bad Request&quot;, content = @Content(mediaType = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE, schema = @Schema(implementation = ErrorResponse.class)))\n</code></pre>\n<p>I couldn't find a direct example of this on the base spring-doc page, but how to hide a schema has something similar: <a href=\"https://springdoc.org/#how-can-i-hide-schema-of-the-the-response\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://springdoc.org/#how-can-i-hide-schema-of-the-the-response</a></p>\n<p><strong>Edit for your comments:</strong></p>\n<p>Since you specified the produces type in the PostMapping spring-doc will infer this for all responses by default, so there's no need to specify that in the @Content annotation.</p>\n<p>It's not entirely clear to me what your method signature looks like:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Are you returning <code>ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt;</code> and mapping the json in the error response yourself?</li>\n<li>Or are you returning <code>ResponseEntity&lt;ErrorResponse&gt;</code> and then returning an empty body on 200?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>spring-doc will automatically attempt to infer the response schema based on the return type, so if you're doing the second one, you won't need to specify the @Content type at all (except on the 200 response where you're returning an empty body, where you'll want to specify just by using an empty <code>@Content</code> annotation to omit the schema).</p>\n<h3>Example of #1</h3>\n<p>If you'd like the schema (with examples) to show up in your spring-doc interface you're going to want to include the <code>schema = @Schema(implementation = ...)</code> portion.</p>\n<p>Here's a further example of what I think you might be trying to

What you do with these colors, i.e. markers, is entirely up to you. However, two patterns seem to be common for marker usage.\r\n\r\n 1. **Triggering**: Some appender could be instructed to take an action in the presence of a certain marker. For example, `SMTPAppender` can be configured to send an email whenever a logging event is marked with the `NOTIFY_ADMIN` marker regardless of the log level. See [marker-based triggering][3] in the logback documentation. You may also combine log levels and markers for triggering.\r\n\r\n 2. **Filtering**: Markers are very useful for making certain valuable log statements stand out.  For example, you can  color/mark all your persistence related logs (in various and multiple class files) with the color &quot;DB&quot;. You could then filter for `&quot;DB&quot;:` to disable logging except for log statements marked with DB. See the [chapter on filters][4] in the logback documentation for more information (search for MarkerFilter). Note that filtering on markers can be performed not just by logback but by log analysis tools as well.\r\n\r\nBefore the advent of Markers, to achieve similar behavior, you had the option 1) using custom levels 2) use modified logger names. SLF4J API currently does not support custom levels. As for option 2, suffixing (or prefixing) logger names is workable if a one or two loggers need to be modified. The approach becomes impractical as soon 3 or more loggers need to be &quot;sub-classed&quot; because the associated configuration files become unmanageable.\r\n\r\nEven though a single marker can be already very useful, as of SLF4J version 2.0, it is possible to set *multiple* markers per log statement.  \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/10231016/100970\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/4165558/100970\r\n  [3]: http://logback.qos.ch/manual/appenders.html#OnMarkerEvaluator\r\n  [4]: http://logback.qos.ch/manual/filters.html","title":"What are markers in Java Logging frameworks and what is a reason to use them?","body":"<p>This is a rehashed version <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/10231016/100970\">my answer</a> to the question &quot;<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/4165558/100970\">Best practices for using Markers in SLF4J/Logback</a>&quot;.</p>\n<p>Markers can be used to <em>color</em> or mark a <em>single</em> log statement.

Below is my web page code please suggest the solution.</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;%@page contentType=&quot;text/html&quot; pageEncoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;%&gt;\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;\n   &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;%@ page import=&quot;java.util.*&quot; %&gt;\n    &lt;%@ page import=&quot;javax.sql.*;&quot; %&gt;\n    &lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;style&gt;\n            table, th, td {\n              border:1px solid black;\n              border-collapse: collapse;\n              text-align: center;\n             }\n            &lt;/style&gt;\n        &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;PoP UP DISPLAY&lt;/title&gt;\n        &lt;script &gt;\n        window.setInterval('refresh()', 800);\n        // Call a function every 800 milliseconds\n        // Refresh or reload page.\n        function refresh() {\n            window .location.reload();\n        }\n         &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n\n    &lt;body style=&quot;background-color: black;&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;jsp:declaration&gt;\n        String reader1 =&quot;&quot;;\n        String reader2 =&quot;&quot;;\n        String image1 =&quot;&quot;;\n        String image2 =&quot;&quot;;\n        String empCode1 =&quot;&quot;;\n        String empCode2 =&quot;&quot;;\n        String empName1 =&quot;&quot;;\n        String empName2 =&quot;&quot;;\n    &lt;/jsp:declaration&gt;\n    &lt;jsp:scriptlet&gt;\n        reader1 = request.getParameter(&quot;reader1&quot;);\n        reader2 = request.getParameter(&quot;reader2&quot;);\n    &lt;/jsp:scriptlet&gt;\n    \n    &lt;%\n\n    java.sql.Connection con1;\n    java.sql.Statement s;\n    java.sql.ResultSet rs1, rs2;\n    java.sql.PreparedStatement pst;\n\n    con1=null;\n    s=null;\n    pst=null;\n    rs1=null;\n    rs2=null;\n\n    // Remember to change the next line with your own environment\n    String url=\n   &quot;jdbc:jtds:sqlserver://IP_Address_Of_DB/ DB_Name;instance= INSTANCEB&quot;;\n    String id= &quot;user_id&quot;;\n    String pass = &quot;user_pass&quot;;\n    try{\n\n    Class.forName(&quot;net.sourceforge.jtds.jdbc.Driver&quot;);\n    con1 = java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(url, id, pass);\n\n    }catch(ClassNotFoundException cnfex){\n    cnfex.printStackTrace();\n\n    }\n    String sql1 = &quot;select top 1 * from ecbacs.EventLog where ReaderId= '&quot;+reader1+&quot;' order by EventNo desc&quot;;\n    String sql2 = &quot;select top 1 * from ecbacs.EventLog where ReaderId= '&quot;+reader2+&quot;' order by EventNo desc&quot;;\n    %&gt;\n    &lt;%\n    try{\n        s = con1.createStatement();\n        rs1 = s.executeQuery(sql1);\n            while( rs1.next() ){\n            empCode1= rs1.getString(&quot;EmpCode&quot;);\n            empName1= rs1.getString(&quot;CardHolderName&quot;);\n            }\n        s = con1.createStatement();\n        rs2 = s.executeQuery(sql2);\n          while( rs2.next() ){\n            empCode2= rs2.getString(&quot;EmpCode&quot;);\n            empName2= rs2.getString(&quot;CardHolderName&quot;);\n            }\n        image1 = empCode1+&quot;.png&quot;;\n        image2 = empCode2+&quot;.png&quot;;\n    %&gt;\n\n    &lt;table style=&quot;height:100%;width:100%; position: absolute; top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0;border:1px solid&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;tr style=&quot;height: 95%;&quot;&gt;\n         &lt;td&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Employee1 Photo&quot;  style=&quot;height: 100%&quot; src=&quot;images/&lt;%=image1%&gt;&quot;&lt;/td&gt;\n         &lt;td&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Employee2 Photo&quot;  style=&quot;height: 100%&quot; src=&quot;images/&lt;%=image2%&gt;&quot;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr &gt;\n        &lt;td style=&quot;color:#ffffff; font-size: 2em&quot;&gt;&lt;%= empName1 %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td style=&quot;color:#ffffff; font-size: 2em&quot;&gt;&lt;%= empName2 %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;/table&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;%\n\n        }\n        catch(Exception e){e.printStackTrace();}\n        finally{\n        if(rs1!=null) rs1.close();\n        if(rs2!=null) rs2.close();\n        if(s!=null) s.close();\n        if(con1!=null) con1.close();\n        }\n\n        %&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am running the above applcation on Apache tomcat version 6.
