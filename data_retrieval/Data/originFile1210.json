In the management database it was updated correctly, but in all other databases not. Now if i want to view some of the contents it throws a render error, because the columns are not there. Is there a way to force hibernate to update this entity in all databases? Or do i have to open them somwhow to let hibernate apply the changes?</p>\n<p>Any help appreciated, thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","jsonpath"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4747922,"reputation":333,"user_id":5191504,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"sprad"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":9,"is_accepted":true,"score":9,"last_activity_date":1486399924,"creation_date":1486399924,"answer_id":42073094,"question_id":42031746,"body_markdown":"I dug around in the JsonPath source code [here](https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath) (and specifically [here](https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath/blob/c2c1686139a128c08578cab377376ffb4b73c623/json-path/src/test/java/com/jayway/jsonpath/FilterParseTest.java)) and found this test:\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void a_not_exists_filter_can_be_serialized() {\r\n\r\n        String filter = filter(where(&quot;a&quot;).exists(false)).toString();\r\n        String parsed = parse(&quot;[?(!@[&#39;a&#39;])]&quot;).toString();\r\n\r\n        assertThat(filter).isEqualTo(parsed);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo the syntax for doing the negative match I&#39;m looking for would just be:\r\n\r\n    $.thing[?(!@.flag)].name\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s lots of other good examples in there.

Project B requires Project A on its build path to compile and to run on a server. \r\nIn both projects, there is a folder webapp with static content like images and so on. \r\nI&#39;ve added the webapp folder of Project A as a Linked Resource (Properties &gt; Resource &gt; Linked Resources) to Project B so that I can access static content of Project A in Project B (there are some more projects in development and using code of Project A, so it is very useful when I only have to put an image in the webapp folder in project A and every other project can directly access it). \r\n\r\nNow I have two images with the same name, let&#39;s say for instance &quot;image.png&quot; in the webapp folder of project A and in the webapp folder of project B. I want that in such a case, when there is a file in both webapp folders witht the same name, that the one from the folder in project B is picked and uploaded to the server. I think it&#39;s possible and the file to pick is determined by the file *org.eclipse.wst.common.component* in the .settings folder of eclipse. \r\n\r\nIn this file, depending on the order in which you added both of the webapp folders to the Deployment Assembly for the project (Properties &gt; Deployment Assembly), both folders are written down. The usual behaviour should be that the files from the first webapp folder noted in that settings-file are picked first in case of a name conflict. On my laptop, this works just fine, but on other laptops it&#39;s not working and always the file from project A is taken.\r\n\r\nNow I think maybe there are even more, some &quot;hidden&quot; eclipse settings or sth like this to determine how these files are picked and how name conflicts are resolved.

Project B requires Project A on its build path to compile and to run on a server.\nIn both projects, there is a folder webapp with static content like images and so on.\nI've added the webapp folder of Project A as a Linked Resource (Properties &gt; Resource &gt; Linked Resources) to Project B so that I can access static content of Project A in Project B (there are some more projects in development and using code of Project A, so it is very useful when I only have to put an image in the webapp folder in project A and every other project can directly access it).</p>\n<p>Now I have two images with the same name, let's say for instance &quot;image.png&quot; in the webapp folder of project A and in the webapp folder of project B. I want that in such a case, when there is a file in both webapp folders witht the same name, that the one from the folder in project B is picked and uploaded to the server. I think it's possible and the file to pick is determined by the file <em>org.eclipse.wst.common.component</em> in the .settings folder of eclipse.</p>\n<p>In this file, depending on the order in which you added both of the webapp folders to the Deployment Assembly for the project (Properties &gt; Deployment Assembly), both folders are written down. The usual behaviour should be that the files from the first webapp folder noted in that settings-file are picked first in case of a name conflict.
