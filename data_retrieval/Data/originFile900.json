Server remove all dangerous characters\r\n 2. Modified data is stored in database\r\n 3. Some time later, server reads modified data from database\r\n 4.

However, it is also more difficult because it potentially destroys the data. It is particulary difficult if you needs the data for something other than sending them back to the browser later on (like using an email address to actually send an email).

A solution to your particular problem would be to html-encode the email address when (or if) you ever put that email address on a web page.\r\n\r\nThe XSS problem is an example of a more general problem that arise when you mix user submitted data and control code. SQL injection is another example of the same problem. The problem is that the user submitted data is interpreted as instructions and not data. A third, less well known example is if you mix user submitted data in an email. The user submitted data may contain strings that the email server interprets as instructions. The &quot;dangerous character&quot; in this scenario is a line break followed by &quot;From:&quot;.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to validate all input data against all possible control characters or sequences of characters that may in some way be interpreted as instructions in some potential application in the future.

SQL injection is another example of the same problem. The problem is that the user submitted data is interpreted as instructions and not data. A third, less well known example is if you mix user submitted data in an email. The user submitted data may contain strings that the email server interprets as instructions. The \"dangerous character\" in this scenario is a line break followed by \"From:\".</p>\n\n<p>It would be impossible to validate all input data against all possible control characters or sequences of characters that may in some way be interpreted as instructions in some potential application in the future. The only permanent solution to this is to actually sanitize all data that is potentially unsafe when you actually use that data.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":400792,"reputation":926,"user_id":766969,"accept_rate":40,"display_name":"bsimic"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1348748352,"creation_date":1348748352,"answer_id":12621222,"question_id":12558471,"body_markdown":"To be honest you should really be doing a whitelist against all user supplied input.

Even if you did fix it. For example, `foo@bar` is actually valid (top-level domains can contain `MX` records. A few do!). This is the general formula for &#39;is it valid email&#39;:\r\n\r\n* Does it contain spaces? If yes, reject.\r\n* Does it contain at least 1 `@`? If no, reject.\r\n* Is the last `@` at position 0 (i.e. at the start), or at the end? Reject.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, pass. There are a few invalid emails that would nevertheless pass, but this is by and large no problem: `foo@bar` is not _really_ legal, but the only real way to know that, is to send an email to it and request the user click a link inside it before they can continue. No regexp is ever going to figure out if the email address entered by a user is in fact a valid email address, let alone an email address that belongs to that user, hence, there is no real point in trying to go any further than that. You&#39;re attempting to catch honest typoes, not actually validate anything, because that is impossible. Note that it can easily become legal tomorrow - someone just needs to set up the `bar` top level domain and make sure there&#39;s an MX record for it in its DNS registration and voila. `foo@bar` is now legal.\r\n\r\nYour regex is close to this ideal; you just want `^.+@.+$`\r\n\r\nNB: If you want to break spec and reject any email addresses to top-level domains, your regex is broken. Your intent is clearly to want `foo@a.b`, but you don&#39;t do that - that middle `.`, nestled between `(.+)`, is still a regex dot operator, meaning: &quot;any character&quot;. You&#39;d want `\\\\.` for that instead. But, don&#39;t - as I said, TLDs are themselves rare as mail servers, but valid according to spec!\r\n\r\nFix this and your code &#39;works&#39;, but note that your code can go only one of two ways:\r\n\r\n* The regexp matches, in which case you _again_ run the string through the regexp (seems rather pointless to do it twice!), and then trivially prints &#39;true&#39;. The entire `Pattern pattern = ...; System.out.println(...)` might as well be `System.out.println(&quot;true&quot;);` - that&#39;s what it will _always_ do - yes, the regexp that just matched, is still going to match, of course.\r\n* The regexp does not match, in which case we get to the else block, which throws an exception. This then goes to the catch block which can only catch this (as nothing else throws IllegalArgumentEx here), and prints the &#39;localized message&#39;, which is `null` here.\r\n\r\nSo, this code prints `true` if it matches, and `null` if it does not. That seems.. weird. And is needlessly complicated if that&#39;s what you wanted.\r\n\r\nBetter:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Test {\r\n  private static final Pattern EMAIL_PATTERN = Pattern.compile(&quot;^.+@.+$&quot;);\r\n\r\n  public static boolean isValidEmail(String email) {\r\n    return EMAIL_PATTERN.matcher(email).matches();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    var keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n\r\n    while (true) {\r\n      System.out.print(&quot;Enter an email address: &quot;);\r\n      String line = keyboard.nextLine().trim();\r\n      if (line.isEmpty()) System.exit(0);\r\n      if (isValidEmail(line)) {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Valid&quot;);\r\n      } else {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Not valid&quot;);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe try/catch block do not add anything useful here. You use try/catch when you want to transfer an error condition across method calls, not within the same method call, and not when the only meaningful data you can convey is a boolean flag. If that&#39;s all you have (&#39;valid&#39; or &#39;not valid&#39;), almost always you just want a boolean.\r\n\r\nIf you really want the exception instead:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Test {\r\n  private static final Pattern EMAIL_PATTERN = Pattern.compile(&quot;^.+@.+$&quot;);\r\n\r\n  public static void validateEmail(String email) throws IllegalArgumentException {\r\n    if (!EMAIL_PATTERN.matcher(email).matches()) {\r\n      throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Email &#39;&quot; + email + &quot;&#39; is not valid&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    var keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n\r\n    while (true) {\r\n      System.out.print(&quot;Enter an email address: &quot;);\r\n      String line = keyboard.nextLine().trim();\r\n      if (line.isEmpty()) System.exit(0);\r\n      try {\r\n        validateEmail(line);\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Valid&quot;);\r\n      } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {\r\n        System.out.println(e.getMessage());\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","title":"Java exception, RegEx","body":"<p>This regular expression rejects valid email addresses.

Moving on to next option its taking the &quot;value&quot; of childnode &quot;item&quot; from previous option.\r\n    \r\n    Example:(Parse Result)\r\n    \r\n    options\r\n    Total Options = 1\r\n    TITLE = ConfigData\r\n    VERSION = 0001\r\n    ===================================\r\n    Total Category inside options = 23\r\n    \r\n    Category Name = GConfigData\r\n    option inside category = 38\r\n    \r\n    \t\r\n    \tOption Name = String_name\r\n    \t\tCaption Name = String Name\r\n    \t\tValue = 350.16.01a\r\n    \r\n    \t\r\n    \tOption Name = FileID\r\n    \t\tCaption Name =  file version\r\n    \t\tValue = 1601\r\n    \r\n    \t\r\n    \tOption Name = SystemID\r\n    \t\tCaption Name = System ID\r\n    \t\tValue = 0\r\n    \r\n    \t\r\n    \tOption Name = SyncTime\r\n    \t\tCaption Name = Sync Time\r\n    \t\tValue = 2\r\n    \r\n    \t\r\n    \tOption Name = UseServer\r\n    \t\tCaption Name = Use Server\r\n    \t\tValue = 0\r\n    \r\n    \t\r\n    \tOption Name = CommType\r\n    \t\tCaption Name = Comm Type\r\n    \t\tValue = 0\r\n    \r\n    \t\r\n    \tOption Name = YYBasis\r\n    \t\tCaption Name = Set YY Basis\r\n    \t\tValue = 0        /*(Here the value should be 70 as in XML file , But its taking the value of option(Name:CommType)/control/list/item(text:parellel)/value )*/\r\n    \r\n    \t\r\n    \tOption Name = Separator\r\n    \t\tCaption Name =  Separator\r\n    \t\tValue = 1       /*(Here the value should be 46 as in XML file , But its taking the value of option(Name:CommType)/control/list/item(text:simple serial)/value)*/\r\n    \r\n    \t\r\n    \tOption Name =WholeSeparator\r\n    \t\tCaption Name = Whole Separator\r\n    \t\tValue = 2     /*(Here the value should be 44 as in XML file , But its taking the value of option(Name:CommType)/control/list/item(text:complex serial)/value)*/\r\n    \r\n    \t\r\n    \tOption Name = DateFormat\r\n    \t\tCaption Name = Date Format\r\n    \t\tValue = 70    //(Value should be 0)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\nAfter the Option Name: CommType , the value of each option is parsed wrongly.\r\n\r\nWhat can be the solution of this? I am new to java as well as XML.\r\n\r\nPS: This is my first question on this forum.I apologize of any spelling mistake and if the way of questioning is wrong.

Security Status does not have onMessage function because I am not using this message so I do not expect to handle other type of messages.
