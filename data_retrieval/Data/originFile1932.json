Is that not the same as `rsa_pkcs1_sha256`? \r\nAlso, my client certificate is signed by Entrust, which is not listed in the certificate authorities for the server&#39;s CertificateRequest.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I made some requests to a different HTTPS server that does not include `certificate authorities` in its CertificateRequest to the client. I verified that SSL can find the expected client certificate and sends it back to the server as expected. So it seems like this is an issue with the server request not including my CA in their list of accepted `certificate authorities`.

Secondly, it is pointless to add any code to a `@Pointcut` method. It will never be called. Only advice type annotations like `@Before`, `@After`, `@Around` can trigger actions.

Cluster becomes unresponsive when relaunching client nodes","body":"<p>We are intermittently seeing the following error on our k8tes setup.\nThe issue happens after we relaunch our tomcat pod which launches new Ignite client nodes.</p>\n<p>I understand the first stack trace shows that Ignite has detected that the tcp communications spi has become unresponsive but I do not see how this has anything to do with the second stack trace.  This seems like two totally unrelated errors but second one says the thread dump is at the same timestamp as the first.  <code>Thread dump at 2021/10/12 15:57:17</code></p>\n<p>The issue can resolved by bringing down all the Ignite pods and relaunching them but A better understanding of this issue and a way to not need to restart Ignite would be apricated.</p>\n<pre><code>12-Oct-2021 15:57:17.139

And this will become very messy in a large app. So whats the best way to represent the <code>fooStream</code> inside the bloc's state? Can I just listen to the stream inside the bloc and add an event to the bloc whenever a <code>fooStream</code> event arrives? Wouldn't this be a bad side effect where state will be updated in a messy way and changes in state can't be tracked anymore?</p>\n<p>Sample code:</p>\n<pre><code>class FooService{\n\n  Stream fooStream;// the stream is exposed here\n\n  ...\n\n}\n\n class MyBloc extends ... {\n  \n  FooService myService = ...;//the service is used here as a member\n  \n  ...\n  \n}\n\nclass MyBlocState extends ... {\n\n  Stream? fooStream;//this value will hold the stream exposed from the service and it may be initialized in an init event in the bloc for example\n\n  ...\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>and now in the UI I have to do this ugly thing (ugly because now I am listening to the state from 2 places, from the bloc and from the stream, which in my opinion defeats the purpose of the bloc as the sole entry point to change the state and maintain it in the UI/app):</p>\n<pre><code>Widget build(BuildContext context){\n  return BlocBuilder&lt;MyBloc,MyBlocState&gt;(\n    builder: (context, myBlocState) {\n      if(myBlocState is Loading){\n        return CircularProgressIndicator();\n      }\n      if(myBlocState is Error){\n        return ErrorWidget();\n      }\n      if(myBlocState is SomeState){\n        return StreamBuilder(//I need to wrap the StreamBuilder inside the BlocBuilder because the stream will be null when the app launches but then it will have a value which is fooStream when I call init in the bloc\n          stream: myBlocState.fooStream,\n          builder: (context, snapshot) {\n            if(snapshot.hasData){\n              return SomeWidget();\n            }\n            else{\n              return SomeOtherWidget();\n            }\n          },\n        );\n      }\n    },\n  )\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","linux"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":5150443,"reputation":34158,"user_id":4125191,"display_name":"RealSkeptic"},"score":4,"creation_date":1559481808,"post_id":56415406,"comment_id":99426880,"body_markdown":"They are not for &quot;file usage&quot; of RAM.

There is just one problem: we cannot instantiate an instance of an interface. But [Inversion of control][Invers] comes to the rescue: instead of instantiating something of type `Inter` within `A`&#39;s constructor, the constructor will demand something that `implements Inter` as parameter:\r\n\r\n    package packageA;\r\n    \r\n    public class A {\r\n        private Inter myInter;\r\n        \r\n        public A(Inter myInter) {\r\n            this.myInter = myInter;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        public void doSomethingThatUsesInter() {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Doing things with myInter&quot;);\r\n            this.myInter.doSomething();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWith this approach we can now change the concrete implementation of `Inter` within `A` at will.

This is going to be a little more complicated than cycling through HSB values, but you can create any pattern you want. Here's an example:</p>\n<pre><code>float r = 0;\nfloat g = 0;\nfloat b = 0;\n\nfloat deltaR = 1;\nfloat deltaG = 2;\nfloat deltaB = 4;\n\nvoid setup(){\n  size(500, 500);\n  background(255);\n}\n\nvoid draw(){\n  \n  r += deltaR;\n  g += deltaG;\n  b += deltaB;\n  \n  if(r &lt; 0 || r &gt; 255){\n    deltaR *= -1;\n    r = constrain(r, 0, 255);\n  }\n  \n  if(g &lt; 0 || g &gt; 255){\n   deltaG *= -1;\n   g = constrain(g, 0, 255);\n  }\n  \n  if(b &lt; 0 || b &gt; 255){\n    deltaB *= -1;\n    b = constrain(b, 0, 255);\n  }\n  \n  fill(r, g, b);\n  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 20, 20);\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":13165582,"reputation":33,"user_id":9509895,"display_name":"Sebastien Karo"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":2197,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":53255047,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1634591517,"creation_date":1541986367,"question_id":53254961,"body_markdown":"I am trying to change the opacity of my strokes, but not sure how do it in HSB color mode.
