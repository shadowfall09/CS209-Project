Mike&#39;s favorite toy is a set of N disks. The boy likes to compose his disks in stacks, but there&#39;s one very important rule: the disks in a single stack must be ordered by their radiuses in a strictly increasing order such that the top-most disk will have the smallest radius.\r\n\r\nFor example, a stack of disks with radii (5, 2, 1) is valid, while a stack of disks with radii (3, 4, 1) is not.\r\n\r\nLittle Mike has recently come up with the following algorithm after the order of disks are given:\r\n\r\nFirst, Mike initiates an empty set of disk stacks.\r\nThen, Mike processes the disks in the chosen order using the following pattern:\r\nIf there is at least one stack such that Mike can put the current disk on the top of the stack without making it invalid, then he chooses the stack with the smallest top disk radius strictly greater than the radius of the current disk, and puts the current disk on top of that stack.\r\nOtherwise, Mike makes a new stack containing only the current disk.\r\nFor example, let&#39;s assume that the order of the disk radii is (3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 2). Here&#39;s how the set of the top stack disks will appear during the algorithm&#39;s run:\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the algorithm, the set of disk stacks is empty. After processing the first disk, the set of top stack disks is {3}.\r\nWe cannot put the second disk on the only stack that we have after processing the first disk, so we make a new stack. After processing the second disk, the set of top stack disks is {3, 4}.\r\nWe cannot put the third disk on any of the available stacks, so we make a new stack. After processing the third disk, the set of top stack disks is {3, 4, 5}.\r\nThe fourth disk has radius 1, so it can be easily put on any of the available stacks. According to the algorithm, we choose the stack with the top disk radius equal to 3. After processing the fourth disk, the set of top stack disks is {1, 4, 5}.\r\nThe fifth disk has radius 1, so there are two stacks we can put it on. According to the algorithm, we choose the stack with the top disk radius equal to 4. After processing the fifth disk, the set of top stack disks is {1, 1, 5}.\r\nThe sixth disk has radius 2, so there is only one stack we can put it on. The final set of top stack disks is {1, 1, 2}.\r\nhere is the code..:\r\n```\r\nimport java.util.Scanner;\r\nimport java.lang.*;\r\nimport java.io.*;\r\n\r\n/* Name of the class has to be &quot;Main&quot; only if the class is public. */\r\nclass Codechef\r\n{\r\n\tpublic static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t// your code goes here\r\n\t\tScanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n        int i,testcases,disks,currentdisk,j,stackarraytop=0,added;\r\n        stack s;\r\n        int[] num;\r\n        stack[] sh= new stack[10];\r\n        testcases=sc.nextInt();\r\n        while(testcases--&gt;0)\r\n        {\r\n            disks=sc.nextInt();\r\n            num = new int[disks];\r\n            for(i=0;i&lt;disks;i++)\r\n            {\r\n                num[i]=sc.nextInt();\r\n            }\r\n            //System.out.print(&quot;no. of disks:&quot;+disks+&quot; input array of disks:&quot;+num+&quot;//\\n&quot;);\r\n            s = new stack(disks);\r\n            for(j=0;j&lt;disks;j++)\r\n            {\r\n                added=0;\r\n                currentdisk=num[j];\r\n                //System.out.println(&quot;current disk:&quot;+currentdisk);\r\n                if(j==0)\r\n                {\r\n                    s.add(currentdisk);\r\n                    sh[stackarraytop++]=s;\r\n                    //sh[0].displaystack();\r\n                    //s.displaystack();\r\n                    //System.out.println(&quot;stacks in the array:&quot;+stackarraytop);\r\n                    continue;\r\n                }\r\n                for(i=0;i&lt;stackarraytop;i++)\r\n                {\r\n                   \r\n                    //System.out.println(&quot;///&quot;+i+&quot; length:&quot;+stackarraytop);\r\n                    if(task.insertcheck(sh[i], currentdisk))\r\n                        {\r\n                            //System.out.println(&quot;stack top:&quot;+sh[i].top);\r\n                            sh[i].add(currentdisk);added=1;//sh[i].displaystack();/\r\n                            break;\r\n                        }\r\n                }\r\n                if(added==0)\r\n                {\r\n                    //System.out.println(&quot;creating new array:&quot;+currentdisk);\r\n                    stack b= new stack(disks-j);\r\n                    b.initiate(disks-j);\r\n                    b.add(currentdisk);\r\n                    sh[stackarraytop++]=b;\r\n                    //sh[stackarraytop-1].displaystack();\r\n                }\r\n                //System.out.println(&quot;stacks in the array:&quot;+stackarraytop);\r\n                //task.stackarraytops(sh,stackarraytop);\r\n            }\r\n            task.stackarraytops(sh,stackarraytop);\r\n            stackarraytop=0;\r\n            s.reset();\r\n        }    \r\n    }\t//\r\n}\r\nclass task{\r\n    static Boolean insertcheck(stack stk,int n){\r\n        int t= stk.top;\r\n        if(n&gt;=stk.stck[t-1])\r\n        {\r\n            //System.out.println(&quot;FALSE &quot;+t+&quot; // &quot;+stk.stck[t-1]);\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n        else return true;\r\n    }\r\n    //static void arraystackentry(stack s,stack[] a,int sat){\r\n      //  a[sat]=s;\r\n    //}\r\n    static void stackarraytops(stack[] s,int limit)\r\n    {\r\n        int i;\r\n        //System.out.print(&quot;stackarrays:&quot;+limit+&quot; //&quot;);\r\n        System.out.print(limit+&quot; &quot;);\r\n        for(i=0;i&lt;limit;i++)\r\n        {\r\n            System.out.print(s[i].stck[(s[i].top)-1]+&quot; &quot;);\r\n        }\r\n        System.out.print(&quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nclass stack{\r\n    public int[] stck;\r\n    int elements=0;\r\n    stack(int n){\r\n        this.stck=new int[n];\r\n    }\r\n    int top = 0;\r\n    void initiate(int n)\r\n    {\r\n        int i;\r\n        for(i=0;i&lt;n;i++){\r\n            stck[i]=0;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    void add(int n)\r\n    {\r\n        stck[top++]=n;\r\n        elements++;\r\n    }\r\n    int pop(int n)\r\n    {\r\n        top--;\r\n        return stck[top];\r\n    }\r\n    void displaystack()\r\n    {\r\n        for(int i=0;i&lt;elements;i++){\r\n            System.out.print(stck[i]+&quot; &quot;);\r\n        }\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    void reset()\r\n    {\r\n        top=0;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","title":"showing nosuchelementexception in java","body":"<p>i am writing a code on stacks where i have used the scanner class but it is showing nosuchelementexception</p>\n<p>This is the question:<br />\nAs every other little boy, Mike has a favorite toy to play with.

I was in favor of BigDecimal but his point was that R would be using primitives same as Java primitives so we would have already noticed if there were any issues with the precision.  It should be noted that the end result we would convert to BigDecimal anyway this is just for the calculation itself.

However, what&#39;s wrong with using the factory method pattern in such a situation?\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say that we want to construct cross-platform UI elements, e.g. `TextBox` and `Button` for Windows and macOS and treat them abstractly.

And we derive the _creator_ and make two specializations `WindowsUICreator`, and `MacUICreator`, and each of which returns the appropriate concrete UI element, as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nabstract class UICreator {\r\n\r\n    public void displayUI() {\r\n        getButton().display();\r\n        getTextBox().display();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    protected abstract Button getButton();\r\n    protected abstract TextBox getTextBox();\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass WindowsUICreator extends UICreator {\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected Button getButton() {\r\n        return new WindowsButton();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected TextBox getTextBox() {\r\n        return new WinTextBox();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass MacUICreator extends UICreator {\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected Button getButton() {\r\n        return new MacButton();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected TextBox getTextBox() {\r\n        return new MacTextBox();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Main {\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        new MacUICreator().displayUI();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat are the downsides of this design? I believe it provides the needed decoupling by not having to deal with any concrete classes, and also provides the proper extensibility in the sense that we can introduce new UI elements and give them new factory methods, or newly supported OSs and implement concrete _creators_ for them.

I believe it provides the needed decoupling by not having to deal with any concrete classes, and also provides the proper extensibility in the sense that we can introduce new UI elements and give them new factory methods, or newly supported OSs and implement concrete <em>creators</em> for them. And if we can use the factory method pattern in the exact situation the abstract factory pattern was designed for, I don't understand why do we have it at all?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","postgresql","hibernate","heap-memory"],"comments":[{"owner":{"display_name":"user330315"},"score":0,"creation_date":1644598807,"post_id":71083765,"comment_id":125657382,"body_markdown":"The DISTINCT is very inefficient here and not needed to begin with if you change the `LEFT JOIN`s to EXISTS conditions - I don&#39; know how to do that in HQL though.","body":"The DISTINCT is very inefficient here and not needed to begin with if you change the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>s to EXISTS conditions - I don&#39; know how to do that in HQL though."},{"owner":{"account_id":3508935,"reputation":159,"user_id":2933780,"display_name":"galaxy"},"score":0,"creation_date":1644602264,"post_id":71083765,"comment_id":125658574,"body_markdown":"You should use a paging mechanism.

Since you&#39;ve extended directly from `JFrame`, the layout is already `BorderLayout`, so this is fine.\r\n\r\nBut then you add `jps` using `add(jps);`, which will add the component to the layouts default position, which in the case of `BorderLayout` is `CENTER`.  This is problematic, as `BorderLayout` only allows a single component to be managed at each position, which explains why you&#39;re `setPreferredScrollableViewportSize` isn&#39;t working, as the `BorderLayout` is ignoring it, and making the component fill the available space in the `CENTER`\r\n\r\nSo, I modified your code.  First, I extended from `JPanel` instead of `JFrame`.  It&#39;s generally discouraged to extend from `JFrame` directly, you&#39;re not adding any new functionality to the class, locking yourself into a single use case and it generally just makes you live more difficult.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I placed the `JScrollPane` at the `SOUTH` position of the `BorderLayout`\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n    import java.awt.BorderLayout;\r\n    import java.awt.Color;\r\n    import java.awt.Dimension;\r\n    import java.awt.EventQueue;\r\n    import java.awt.Font;\r\n    import java.awt.Insets;\r\n    import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;\r\n    import java.awt.event.ActionListener;\r\n    import javax.swing.JButton;\r\n    import javax.swing.JFrame;\r\n    import javax.swing.JOptionPane;\r\n    import javax.swing.JPanel;\r\n    import javax.swing.JScrollPane;\r\n    import javax.swing.JTable;\r\n    import javax.swing.UIManager;\r\n    import javax.swing.UnsupportedLookAndFeelException;\r\n\r\n    public class Main {\r\n\r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            new Main();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public Main() {\r\n            EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public void run() {\r\n                    try {\r\n                        UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());\r\n                    } catch (ClassNotFoundException | InstantiationException | IllegalAccessException | UnsupportedLookAndFeelException ex) {\r\n                        ex.printStackTrace();\r\n                    }\r\n\r\n                    JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;Testing&quot;);\r\n                    frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\r\n                    frame.add(new GUICommandFunctionsPane());\r\n                    frame.pack();\r\n                    frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\r\n                    frame.setVisible(true);\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public class GUICommandFunctionsPane extends JPanel {\r\n\r\n            private JButton ButtonOne;\r\n            private JTable jt;\r\n\r\n            public GUICommandFunctionsPane() {\r\n                setLayout(new BorderLayout());\r\n                JPanel panel = new JPanel();\r\n                this.add(panel, BorderLayout.CENTER);

Since you've extended directly from <code>JFrame</code>, the layout is already <code>BorderLayout</code>, so this is fine.</p>\n<p>But then you add <code>jps</code> using <code>add(jps);</code>, which will add the component to the layouts default position, which in the case of <code>BorderLayout</code> is <code>CENTER</code>.  This is problematic, as <code>BorderLayout</code> only allows a single component to be managed at each position, which explains why you're <code>setPreferredScrollableViewportSize</code> isn't working, as the <code>BorderLayout</code> is ignoring it, and making the component fill the available space in the <code>CENTER</code></p>\n<p>So, I modified your code.  First, I extended from <code>JPanel</code> instead of <code>JFrame</code>.  It's generally discouraged to extend from <code>JFrame</code> directly, you're not adding any new functionality to the class, locking yourself into a single use case and it generally just makes you live more difficult.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I placed the <code>JScrollPane</code> at the <code>SOUTH</code> position of the <code>BorderLayout</code></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RLahB.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RLahB.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<pre><code>import java.awt.BorderLayout;\nimport java.awt.Color;\nimport java.awt.Dimension;\nimport java.awt.EventQueue;\nimport java.awt.Font;\nimport java.awt.Insets;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionEvent;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionListener;\nimport javax.swing.JButton;\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\nimport javax.swing.JOptionPane;\nimport javax.swing.JPanel;\nimport javax.swing.JScrollPane;\nimport javax.swing.JTable;\nimport javax.swing.UIManager;\nimport javax.swing.UnsupportedLookAndFeelException;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        new Main();\n    }\n\n    public Main() {\n        EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                try {\n                    UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());\n                } catch (ClassNotFoundException | InstantiationException | IllegalAccessException | UnsupportedLookAndFeelException ex) {\n                    ex.printStackTrace();\n                }\n\n                JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;Testing&quot;);\n                frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n                frame.add(new GUICommandFunctionsPane());\n                frame.pack();\n                frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\n                frame.setVisible(true);\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    public class GUICommandFunctionsPane extends JPanel {\n\n        private JButton ButtonOne;\n        private JTable jt;\n\n        public GUICommandFunctionsPane() {\n            setLayout(new BorderLayout());\n            JPanel panel = new JPanel();\n            this.add(panel, BorderLayout.CENTER);

Attempting to set size to -1 to end the program at this point causes an endless loop of \r\n```\r\njava.io.EOFException\r\n```\r\ninside ServerDemo, while entering what should be a valid packet size between 0 and 16384 instead produces an endless stream of\r\n```\r\njava.net.SocketException: Broken pipe (Write failed)\r\n```\r\ninside ClientDemo. Perhaps most strangely, the latter error only SOMETIMES occurs, not always. If anyone has any pointers on how to get this correctly working and remedying these errors, I would greatly appreciate it!","title":"Java: can&#39;t close Client connection without closing Server","body":"<p>I made a previous post a bit back working on getting a two-way server/client socket connection working.

Super Simple leave me votes thanks again.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":24227484,"reputation":1,"user_id":18181773,"display_name":"Krishna Wadhwani"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1644590793,"creation_date":1644590793,"answer_id":71082007,"question_id":35673302,"body_markdown":"Check this out I am using this\r\n```\r\nclass TypingBot extends Thread{\r\n    String textToAnimate;\r\n    int delayInMilliSeconds;\r\n    public TypingBot(String s, int delayInMilliSeconds){\r\n        this.textToAnimate = s;\r\n        this.delayInMilliSeconds = delayInMilliSeconds;\r\n    }\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void run(){\r\n        for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; textToAnimate.length() ; i++){\r\n            System.out.print(textToAnimate.charAt(i));\r\n            try{\r\n                Thread.sleep(delayInMilliSeconds);\r\n            }\r\n            catch (Exception e){\r\n                System.out.println(e);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class TypingAnimation {\r\n    public static void startAnimation(String textToAnimate, int waitForMillis){\r\n        TypingBot typingBot = new TypingBot(textToAnimate, waitForMillis);\r\n        typingBot.isDaemon();\r\n        typingBot.start();\r\n\r\n        Thread currentThread = Thread.currentThread();\r\n        try{\r\n            currentThread.join(waitForMillis);\r\n        }\r\n        catch (Exception e){\r\n            System.out.println(e);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    public static void main(String[] args){\r\n        startAnimation(&quot;Krishna Wadhwani Is The Best Programmer&quot;, 500);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```","title":"Java typewriter effect","body":"<p>Check this out I am using this</p>\n<pre><code>class TypingBot extends Thread{\n    String textToAnimate;\n    int delayInMilliSeconds;\n    public TypingBot(String s, int delayInMilliSeconds){\n        this.textToAnimate = s;\n        this.delayInMilliSeconds = delayInMilliSeconds;\n    }\n    @Override\n    public void run(){\n        for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; textToAnimate.length() ; i++){\n            System.out.print(textToAnimate.charAt(i));\n            try{\n                Thread.sleep(delayInMilliSeconds);\n            }\n            catch (Exception e){\n                System.out.println(e);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class TypingAnimation {\n    public static void startAnimation(String textToAnimate, int waitForMillis){\n        TypingBot typingBot = new TypingBot(textToAnimate, waitForMillis);\n        typingBot.isDaemon();\n        typingBot.start();\n\n        Thread currentThread = Thread.currentThread();\n        try{\n            currentThread.join(waitForMillis);\n        }\n        catch (Exception e){\n            System.out.println(e);\n        }\n    }\n    public static void main(String[] args){\n        startAnimation(&quot;Krishna Wadhwani Is The Best Programmer&quot;, 500);\n    }\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":7515004,"reputation":17,"user_id":5708738,"accept_rate":57,"display_name":"jack kennedy"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":8716,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":35673428,"answer_count":4,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1644590793,"creation_date":1456595715,"question_id":35673302,"body_markdown":"Hello I want to have a typewrite effect on the screen where every few seconds a letter appear after the previous one.

When `openjdk` is compiled with this flag you&#39;ll have this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreadelf -n /path/to/openjdk/lib/server/libjvm.so\r\n\r\n  stapsdt              0x0000002f       NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)\r\n    Provider: hotspot\r\n    Name: thread__yield\r\n    Location: 0x000000000098745b, Base: 0x000000000107e7f4, Semaphore: 0x0000000000000000\r\n    Arguments: \r\n  stapsdt              0x0000003d       NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)\r\n    Provider: hotspot\r\n    Name: thread__sleep__begin\r\n    Location: 0x000000000098ff64, Base: 0x000000000107e7f4, Semaphore: 0x0000000000000000\r\n    Arguments: -8@%r12\r\n  stapsdt              0x00000039       NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)\r\n    Provider: hotspot\r\n    Name: thread__sleep__end\r\n    Location: 0x000000000098ffa3, Base: 0x000000000107e7f4, Semaphore: 0x0000000000000000\r\n    Arguments: -4@$0\r\n  stapsdt              0x00000039       NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)\r\n    Provider: hotspot\r\n    Name: thread__sleep__end\r\n    Location: 0x0000000000990100, Base: 0x000000000107e7f4, Semaphore: 0x0000000000000000\r\n    Arguments: -4@$1\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo your options is either, build openjdk yourself and ensure to use `--enable-dtrace` flag (this would require [systemtap](https://sourceware.org/systemtap/) as dependency) or use package that has been provided by someone else. As for prebuild package, I can recommend [this](https://adoptium.net/index.html?variant=openjdk11&amp;jvmVariant=hotspot) prebuild package. Unfortunately, there is no `*.deb` package there (there is only `.tar.gz`), but I know for sure that it has been built with `--enable-dtrace`. I&#39;m recommending this because I know that certain distros using these packages (for example [Gentoo](https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/blob/master/dev-java/openjdk-bin/openjdk-bin-11.0.14_p9-r1.ebuild#L9)).","title":"How to enable UDST in java?","body":"<p>Kernel has nothing to do USDT probes, since these have to be in the <code>libjvm.so</code>.

So for example if I call &quot;room5.northWall.Height&quot; and room5 is set to be connected with room4 by the north wall, I would get &quot;room4.Height&quot; instead.</p>\n<pre><code>public void connectNorthTo(Room r) {\n        northWall = r;\n    } \n\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>public Room(int dx, int dy, Color color) {\n        this.northWall = null;\n        this.eastWall = null;\n        this.westWall = null;\n        this.southWall = null;\n        this.Color = color;\n        this.Height = dy;\n        this.Width = dx;\n        this.Y = 0;\n        this.X = 0;\n        this.bottomY = this.Y + dy;\n        this.RightX = this.X + dx;\n\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {\n            super.paintComponent(g);\n            drawRooms(g);\n            drawCorridors(g);\n        }\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>private void drawCorridors(Graphics g) {\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; lv.roomList.size(); i++) {\n\n                Room room = lv.roomList.get(i);\n                g.setColor(room.Color);\n\n                if (room.northWall != null) {\n\n                    g.drawRect((room.RightX - (room.Width / 2)), room.northWall.bottomY, 5,\n                            (room.Y - room.northWall.bottomY));\n\n                }\n                if (room.southWall != null) {\n\n                    g.drawRect((room.RightX - (room.Width / 2)), room.bottomY, 5,\n                            (room.southWall.Y - room.bottomY));\n\n                }\n                if (room.eastWall != null) {\n\n                    g.drawRect(room.RightX, (room.bottomY - (room.Height / 2)), \n                            (room.eastWall.X - room.RightX), 5);\n\n                }\n                if (room.westWall != null) {\n\n                    g.drawRect(room.westWall.RightX, (room.bottomY - (room.Height / 2)),\n                            (room.X - room.westWall.RightX), 5);\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The rectangles work perfectly fine, and are at the intended coordinates and dimensions.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The problem</strong></em> is that I get this output: (minus the <code>set.fillrect</code> which I removed to minimize code)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FTALY.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FTALY.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Which is of course not what I intended, At All.</p>\n<p>I tried it with only two rooms and putting the X to 10 and the Y to 20 for the corridor to see how it would react.

To always be in a consistent state! Your application will never allow a non-valid password. You want to add or remove password validations, like length and etc? You edit the Password class. Not some weird, full of noise class. Your GUI does simple calls to this classes that contain the actual logic. \r\n\r\nIn addition, you achieve testability. How would you test in an automated-way your GUI code? This is a complex topic and for sure it is not the best way to test application logic through the UI. Extracting logic and rules to other classes, you can &quot;just test them&quot;:\r\n\r\n    public class PasswordShould {\r\n    \r\n    \t@Test\r\n    \tvoid not_be_valid_when_is_empty() {\r\n    \t\tassertThrows(RuntimeException.class, () -&gt; Password.of(null));\r\n    \t\tassertThrows(RuntimeException.class, () -&gt; Password.of(&quot;&quot;));\r\n    \t\tassertThrows(RuntimeException.class, () -&gt; Password.of(&quot;  &quot;));\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \t@Test\r\n    \tvoid not_be_valid_when_is_weak() {\r\n    \t\tassertThrows(RuntimeException.class, () -&gt; Password.of(&quot;1234&quot;));\r\n    \t\tassertThrows(RuntimeException.class, () -&gt; Password.of(&quot;GGfdsfds12312&quot;));\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \t@Test\r\n    \tvoid be_valid_when_is_strong() {\r\n    \t\tassertDoesNotThrow(() -&gt; Password.of(&quot;GGf##dsfds12312&quot;));\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMy code might be a lot to digest, but I suggest to give it a try to understand it. First of all, take a look at the readability. You came here, because you can&#39;t debug your own code. Well...Neither can we. \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle","title":"Preventing duplicate accounts from being made, infinite amount of messages","body":"<h1>Don't do that!</h1>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Separation of Concerns</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Single Responsibility Principle</a>.</p>\n<p>Don't put such logic to the code that is responsible for showing things to the user.

To always be in a consistent state! Your application will never allow a non-valid password. You want to add or remove password validations, like length and etc? You edit the Password class. Not some weird, full of noise class. Your GUI does simple calls to this classes that contain the actual logic.</p>\n<p>In addition, you achieve testability. How would you test in an automated-way your GUI code? This is a complex topic and for sure it is not the best way to test application logic through the UI. Extracting logic and rules to other classes, you can &quot;just test them&quot;:</p>\n<pre><code>public class PasswordShould {\n\n    @Test\n    void not_be_valid_when_is_empty() {\n        assertThrows(RuntimeException.class, () -&gt; Password.of(null));\n        assertThrows(RuntimeException.class, () -&gt; Password.of(&quot;&quot;));\n        assertThrows(RuntimeException.class, () -&gt; Password.of(&quot;  &quot;));\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    void not_be_valid_when_is_weak() {\n        assertThrows(RuntimeException.class, () -&gt; Password.of(&quot;1234&quot;));\n        assertThrows(RuntimeException.class, () -&gt; Password.of(&quot;GGfdsfds12312&quot;));\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    void be_valid_when_is_strong() {\n        assertDoesNotThrow(() -&gt; Password.of(&quot;GGf##dsfds12312&quot;));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>My code might be a lot to digest, but I suggest to give it a try to understand it. First of all, take a look at the readability. You came here, because you can't debug your own code. Well...Neither can we.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":24212852,"reputation":13,"user_id":18169131,"display_name":"Kobe Franssen"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":89,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":71066873,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1644588245,"creation_date":1644481555,"question_id":71061871,"body_markdown":"I have been writing code for my Computer Science Internal assessment, I am close to finishing it but keep finding this error, I am unsure how to solve it.\r\n\r\nHere is my code for that section:\r\n\r\n    JButton createbutton = new JButton(&quot;Create&quot;);\r\n    createbutton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\r\n            String[] characters = { &quot;!&quot;, &quot;#&quot;, &quot;$&quot;, &quot;%&quot;, &quot;^&quot;, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;*&quot;
