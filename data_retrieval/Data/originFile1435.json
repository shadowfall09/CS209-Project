With each word being processed we need to maintain the origin of that word so that we know what Title it came from rather than just carrying out a simple occurrence count of all column 2 words in all rows (file lines). This if course then means that the KEY for the Map which would be a word must also hold the origin of the word. This isn&#39;t a big deal but a little more thought will be needed when it comes time to pull relevant data from the Map so to display it properly in the Console Window or, to use for other purposes within the application. What we could do is utilize a List Interface of Map, for example: \r\n\r\n    List&lt;Map&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; mapsList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\nBy doing this we can place each file line processed into a Map and then add that map to a List named `mapsList`.\r\n\r\nThe provided text file contents example leaves little to be desired, never the less, it does help to some extent in the sense that, it comforts me to know that, yes, there is a Header line in the CSV data file and the fact that  the typical comma is used as the delimiter in the file .... and that&#39;s all. So more questions come to mind:\r\n\r\n 1. Can more than one file data line contain the same Title (Origin)?\r\n     - If &quot;yes&quot;, then what do you want to do with the word \r\n       occurrences for the other line(s)?\r\n          - Do you want to add them to the first established \r\n            Title?\r\n          - Or do you want to start a new modified Title? (must be a different title name in this case) \r\n\r\n 2. Will the second column (the text column) ever possibly contain a\r\n    comma delimiter? Commas are very common in text of reasonable\r\n    length.\r\n     - If &quot;yes&quot;, is the text in column 2 enclosed in quotation marks?\r\n\r\n 3. How long can the text in column 2 possibly get to? (just curious - it&#39;s actually irrelevant).\r\n\r\n 4. Will there ever be different CSV files to get Word Occurrences from\r\n    which contain more than three columns?\r\n\r\n 5. Will there ever be a time where Word Occurrences will need to be\r\n    derived from **more than one column** on any CSV file data line?\r\n\r\nThe method provided below (in the runnable application) named **getWordOccurrencesFromCSV()** is flexible enough to basically cover all the questions above. This method also makes use of two other *helper* methods named **getWordOccurrences()** and **combineSameOrigins()** to get the job done. These helper methods can be used on their own for other situations if so desired although the **combineSameOrigins()** method is uniquely designed for the **getWordOccurrencesFromCSV()** method. The **startApp()** method gets the ball rolling and displays the generated List of Maps into the console Window. \r\n\r\nHere is the runnable code (be sure to read ALL the comments in code):\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage so_demo_hybridize;\r\n\r\npublic class SO_Demo_hybridize {\r\n\r\n    private final java.util.Scanner userInput = new java.util.Scanner(System.in);\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        // Started this way to avoid the need for statics.\r\n        new SO_Demo_hybridize().startApp(args);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void startApp(String[] args) {\r\n        String ls = System.lineSeparator();\r\n        String filePath = &quot;DemoCSV.csv&quot;; //&quot;DemoCSV.csv&quot;;\r\n        \r\n        /* Retrieve the neccessary data from the supplied CSV \r\n           file and place it into a List of Maps:\r\n        \r\n           getWordOccurrencesFromCSV() Parameters Info:\r\n           --------------------------------------------\r\n           filePath:  Path and file name of the CSV file.\r\n           &quot;,&quot;     :  The delimiter used in the CSV file.\r\n           1       :  The literal data column which will hold the Origin String.\r\n           2       :  The literal data column which will hold text of words to get occurrences from.\r\n           1       :  The minimum number of occurrences needed to save.   */\r\n        java.util.List&lt;java.util.Map&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; mapsList\r\n                = getWordOccurrencesFromCSV(filePath, &quot;,&quot;, 1, new int[]{2}, 1);\r\n\r\n        /* Display what is desired from the gathered file data now \r\n           contained within the Maps held within the &#39;mapsList&#39; List.\r\n           Now that you have this List of Maps, you can do whatever \r\n           and display whatever you like with the data.           */\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Word Occurrences In CSV File&quot; + ls \r\n                         + &quot;============================&quot; + ls);\r\n        for (java.util.Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; maps : mapsList) {\r\n            String mapTitle = &quot;&quot;;\r\n            int cnt = 0;\r\n            for (java.util.Map.Entry&lt;String, Integer&gt; entry : maps.entrySet()) {\r\n                /* Because the Origin is attached to the Map Key (a word) \r\n                   we need to split it off.

With each word being processed we need to maintain the origin of that word so that we know what Title it came from rather than just carrying out a simple occurrence count of all column 2 words in all rows (file lines). This if course then means that the KEY for the Map which would be a word must also hold the origin of the word. This isn't a big deal but a little more thought will be needed when it comes time to pull relevant data from the Map so to display it properly in the Console Window or, to use for other purposes within the application. What we could do is utilize a List Interface of Map, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;Map&lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; mapsList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>By doing this we can place each file line processed into a Map and then add that map to a List named <code>mapsList</code>.</p>\n<p>The provided text file contents example leaves little to be desired, never the less, it does help to some extent in the sense that, it comforts me to know that, yes, there is a Header line in the CSV data file and the fact that  the typical comma is used as the delimiter in the file .... and that's all. So more questions come to mind:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Can more than one file data line contain the same Title (Origin)?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If &quot;yes&quot;, then what do you want to do with the word\noccurrences for the other line(s)?\n<ul>\n<li>Do you want to add them to the first established\nTitle?</li>\n<li>Or do you want to start a new modified Title? (must be a different title name in this case)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>Will the second column (the text column) ever possibly contain a\ncomma delimiter? Commas are very common in text of reasonable\nlength.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If &quot;yes&quot;, is the text in column 2 enclosed in quotation marks?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>How long can the text in column 2 possibly get to? (just curious - it's actually irrelevant).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Will there ever be different CSV files to get Word Occurrences from\nwhich contain more than three columns?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Will there ever be a time where Word Occurrences will need to be\nderived from <strong>more than one column</strong> on any CSV file data line?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The method provided below (in the runnable application) named <strong>getWordOccurrencesFromCSV()</strong> is flexible enough to basically cover all the questions above. This method also makes use of two other <em>helper</em> methods named <strong>getWordOccurrences()</strong> and <strong>combineSameOrigins()</strong> to get the job done. These helper methods can be used on their own for other situations if so desired although the <strong>combineSameOrigins()</strong> method is uniquely designed for the <strong>getWordOccurrencesFromCSV()</strong> method.

According to [this](https://coderwall.com/p/4db9ca/about-jenkins-pipeline-stash-and-unstash), \r\n\r\n&gt; When you stash a file on a slave, the files are send to the master.\r\n&gt; The files will be stored in the Job folder, in the associated build\r\n&gt; folder under the stash folder.

a &lt; items.length; a++)\r\n{\r\n    for(int b = a + 1; b &lt; items.length; b++)\r\n    {\r\n    \tif (compare(items[a], items[b]) &gt; 0) {\r\n    \t\tswap(items, a, b);\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote: I use a `swap` helper function to keep things tidy. It is simply:\r\n```\r\npublic static void swap(String[] array, int a, int b) {\r\n\tString temp = array[a];\r\n\tarray[a] = array[b];\r\n\tarray[b] = temp;\r\n}\r\n```","title":"add an element to the last index when ordering alphabetically","body":"<p>You can use <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#sort(T%5B%5D,%20java.util.Comparator)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Arrays.sort</code></a> with a custom compare function that always puts &quot;EMPTY&quot; last.</p>\n<pre><code>public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception\n{\n    String [] items = {&quot;hi&quot;,&quot;EMPTY&quot;,&quot;ahi&quot;};\n    Arrays.sort(items, (s1, s2) -&gt; {\n                            if (s1.equals(&quot;EMPTY&quot;)) return 1;\n                            else if (s2.equals(&quot;EMPTY&quot;)) return -1;\n                            else return s1.compareTo(s2);\n                        });\n                    \n    System.out.println(&quot;After sorting names in an alphabetical order: &quot;);\n    System.out.println(String.join(&quot;, &quot;, items));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you can't use <code>Arrays.sort</code>, you can re-write your code as</p>\n<pre><code>for(int a = 0; a &lt; items.length; a++)\n{\n    for(int b = a + 1; b &lt; items.length; b++)\n    {\n        // EMPTY is before - swap\n        if (items[a].equals(&quot;EMPTY&quot;)) swap(items, a, b);\n        // EMPTY is after - leave it\n        else if (items[b].equals(&quot;EMPTY&quot;)) continue;\n        // Neither is EMPTY - regular compare\n        else if (items[a].compareTo(items[b]) &gt; 0) swap(items, a, b);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or shorten that to:</p>\n<pre><code>for(int a = 0; a &lt; items.length; a++)\n{\n    for(int b = a + 1; b &lt; items.length; b++)\n    {\n        if ((items[a].equals(&quot;EMPTY&quot;)) || (!items[b].equals(&quot;EMPTY&quot;) &amp;&amp; items[a].compareTo(items[b]) &gt; 0)) {\n            swap(items, a, b);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Lastly, to use a comparator in your code, first create the compare function:</p>\n<pre><code>public static int compare(String a, String b) {\n    if (a.equals(&quot;EMPTY&quot;)) return 1;\n    else if (b.equals(&quot;EMPTY&quot;)) return -1;\n    else return a.compareTo(b);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then use it with</p>\n<pre><code>for(int a = 0; a &lt; items.length; a++)\n{\n    for(int b = a + 1; b &lt; items.length; b++)\n    {\n        if (compare(items[a], items[b]) &gt; 0) {\n            swap(items, a, b);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: I use a <code>swap</code> helper function to keep things tidy.

But the only way to have lossless translation is to use a unicode flavor, and UTF-8 is most sensible.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1457901,"reputation":420,"user_id":1373031,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"Peter"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1649785950,"creation_date":1649784380,"answer_id":71846856,"question_id":71680805,"body_markdown":"After some digging I was able to find solution based on [this answer][1] using [org.apache.lucene.analysis.ASCIIFoldingFilter][2]\r\n\r\nAll the examples I was able to find were using the static version of the method [foldToASCII][3] as in [this project][4]:\r\n\r\n\tprivate static String getFoldedString(String text) {\r\n\t\tchar[] textChar = text.toCharArray();\r\n\t\tchar[] output = new char[textChar.length * 4];\r\n\t\tint outputPos = ASCIIFoldingFilter.foldToASCII(textChar, 0, output, 0, textChar.length);\r\n\t\ttext = new String(output, 0, outputPos);\r\n\t\treturn text;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nHowever that static method has a note on it saying \r\n\r\n&gt; This API is for internal purposes only and might change in incompatible ways in the next release.\r\n\r\nSo after some trial and error I came up with this version that avoids using the static method:\r\n\r\n\tpublic static String getFoldedString(String text) throws IOException {\r\n\t\tString output = &quot;&quot;;\r\n\t\ttry (Analyzer analyzer = CustomAnalyzer.builder()\r\n\t\t          .withTokenizer(KeywordTokenizerFactory.class)\r\n\t\t          .addTokenFilter(ASCIIFoldingFilterFactory.class)\r\n\t\t          .build()) {\r\n\t\t\ttry (TokenStream ts = analyzer.tokenStream(null, new StringReader(text))) {\r\n\t\t\t    CharTermAttribute charTermAtt = ts.addAttribute(CharTermAttribute.class);\r\n\t\t\t    ts.reset();\r\n\t\t\t    if (ts.incrementToken()) output = charTermAtt.toString();\r\n\t\t\t    ts.end();\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn output;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nSimilar to an answer I provided [here][5].\r\n\r\nThis does exactly what I was looking for and translates characters to their ASCII 7-bit equivalent version.\r\n\r\nHowever, through further research I have found that because I am mostly dealing with Windows-1252 encoding and because of the way jt400 handles ASCII &lt;-&gt; EBCDIC (CCSID 37) translation, if an ASCII string is translated to EBCDIC and back to ACSII, the only characters that are lost are `0x80` through `0x9f`.

Would this be much of an issue?\r\n\r\nI&#39;d say so. JDK15 is the first JDK that __does not include nashorn__. The latest &#39;long term support release is JDK17, and the current OpenJDK release is 18, so at this point, yes, this is a big issue.\r\n\r\n&gt; and if so what would be the best alternative for what I&#39;m trying to do?\r\n\r\nInstead of relying on a javascript engine shipped with the JDK, you should pick a third-party javascript engine and ship it with your app. Java apps should be having many many dependencies (hundreds, perhaps) - JDK doesn&#39;t ship web template engines, web routing, DB interaction libraries (JDBC ships with the JDK but it isn&#39;t intended to be directly used, it&#39;s more the low-level library that things like JDBI, JOOQ, and Hibernate are built on top of), and so much more. On purpose - the JDK can _never_ break backward compatibility, and that&#39;s too much handcuffed for many kinds of libraries. The solution is to use the robust and extensive open-source library. Every java build tool that is popular (be it Maven, Gradle, or even ant+ivy) makes it extremely simple; just put the GAV (Group::Artifact::Version) ID of the library you want in your build file and the tool takes care of everything (downloading it from a network of mirrored servers, tools to keep it up to date, shipping it, etc).\r\n\r\n[Here is a tutorial](https://golb.hplar.ch/2020/04/java-javascript-engine.html) that adds the GraalVM javascript engine to a project. It&#39;s not the only javascript engine, you have alternatives. But it shows the principle.\r\n\r\n## I can&#39;t get it to work when it&#39;s in a jar file\r\n\r\n&gt; `new FileReader(&quot;/Script.js&quot;)`\r\n\r\nIn java, __File means File__. An entry in a jar file __is not a file__. Hence, `FileReader`? You&#39;ve already lost, you can&#39;t use that stuff for resources.\r\n\r\nWhat you want to use is the GRAS mechanism instead: Ask java&#39;s classloader infrastructure to load resources from the same place it loads class files (think about it as follows: class files __are resources__ - your java application doesn&#39;t work without them, and the JVM itself needs to load them as your app runs. Why should, say, an icon file for your GUI, or some javascript you want to throw through a javascript engine be any different?)\r\n\r\nThe only way to do that is GRAS. It comes in 2 forms:\r\n\r\n### Form 1: When the API takes a URL object.\r\n\r\nSome APIs have a method that takes a URL. For example, ImageIcon and most other things in the GUI libraries java offers (swing, JavaFX, etc). For these:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Example {\r\n  void example() {\r\n    URL resource = Example.class.getResource(&quot;foo.png&quot;);\r\n    new ImageIcon(resource);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Form 2: InputStream\r\n\r\nIf the API doesn&#39;t offer a method variant that takes a URL, surely there&#39;s one that takes either an `InputStream` (for byte-based things, like image files) or a `Reader` (for char-based things, like javascript). You can trivially turn an inputstream into a reader by specifying a charset encoding:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry (InputStream in = ...) {\r\n  Reader r = new InputStreamReader(in, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\r\n  somethingThatNeedsAReader(r);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that these are resources, you must safely close them, hence try-with-resources is required (or roll your try/finally if you must). Otherwise, your app will eventually start crashing because it ran out of file handles.\r\n\r\nSo, all we need to know is how to obtain InputStream objects - as we can use the above trick to turn them into readers. It works like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry (InputStream in = Example.class.getResourceAsStream(&quot;foo.js&quot;)) {\r\n  ....\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## That path string\r\n\r\nThe string you pass to `getResource` and `getResourceAsStream` is not quite a file path. It looks in the same place that `Example.class` (the class file that has the code for your Example class) is at, even if that is in a jar file. Even if it&#39;s generated on the fly, downloaded on the fly - java&#39;s classloader system is an abstract concept, who knows how it&#39;s loading these. That&#39;s the point: You just load from wherever that might be.\r\n\r\nSuch entries have a &#39;root&#39; - and you can go from the root as well, by prefixing it with a slash.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n1. You have a class named `Example`, in package `com.foo`.\r\n2. It&#39;s packed into a jar file together with the js file.\r\n3. Therefore, in that jar file, there&#39;s an entry `/com/foo/Example.class`.\r\n4. Let&#39;s say the js file is in `/com/foo/js/myapp.js`\r\n\r\nThen you can load that resource as an inputstream using either of these:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExample.class.getResource(&quot;js/myapp.js&quot;); // relative to com/foo\r\nExample.class.getResource(&quot;/com/foo/js/myapp.js&quot;); // relative to root\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s not a file system - `..` does not work, for example. Had it been in `/js/myapp.js`, then the leading-slash-strategy is the only option.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives that suck\r\n\r\nThese are common in tutorials and SO answers but you should never use them:\r\n\r\n1. `getClass().getResource` instead of `Example.class.getResource` - the getClass trick breaks if someone subclasses. It&#39;s unlikely, but why write code that is strictly worse, right? Avoid the style guide debate and use the version that works in strictly more cases.\r\n2. `Example.class.getClassLoader().getResource()` - this is needlessly longer, removes the ability for using relative paths, and breaks in certain cases. For example, classes loaded as boot load don&#39;t _have_ a classloader, and the above code would therefore throw `NullPointerException`. But e.g. `String.class.getResource(&quot;String.class&quot;)` works fine.\r\n\r\n## Things you can&#39;t do\r\n\r\nThe resource loader system only has the &#39;primitive&#39; of &#39;load a resource&#39;. __There is no list() operation!__ - a few libraries suggest it exists but these are hacks that will break in certain circumstances. Hence, if you want something like &#39;can I get a list of all js files in the js dir?&#39; the answer is simple: No, that is not possible.\r\n\r\nThe general solution to this is to make a text file that lists the resources you&#39;re interested in, saves that into a text file with a known name. Now to &#39;fake&#39; a &quot;list all resources&quot; operation, you load that file using `getResource`, process it, loading each entry with `.getResource` in turn. This is exactly how SPI works (which is how e.g. java itself discovers available JDBC drivers, charset providers, crypto providers, etc). Now you know what to search the web for if you need &#39;list all resources of some kind&#39; :)\r\n","title":"Access a file from a resources folder in java (Run a JavaScript file)","body":"<h2>Using nashorn</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm using version OpenJDK 11.

Then click the Build button (obviously, after you&#39;ve entered all the other parameters - but the only value you need to enter on the **JRE** tab itself is the **Bundled JRE path** value.)\r\n\r\nI would have expected that to work, but if you then move the .exe to a new location (so it is no longer co-located with your **jre6** folder) you get the *This application was configured to use a bundled Java Runtime Environment but the runtime is missing or corrupted* error when you try to run the application...\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been playing around with this all day and there was no way I could get *Launch4J* to include the JRE in the .exe file. Really poor in my opinion, as their documentation does not seem to allude to this issue at all.\r\n\r\nSo what I did to solve was to use *Inno Setup Compiler (ISC)*.
