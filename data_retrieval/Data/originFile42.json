This causes a lot of extra methods compared with `java.util.Calendar` (although latter is not type-safe at all due to excessive use of ints).\r\n\r\n**Performance**\r\n\r\nSee the other answer by @OO7 pointing to the analysis of Mikhail Vorontsov although point 3 (exception catching) is probably obsolete - see [this JDK-bug][4]. The different performance (which is in general favour of [JSR-310][5]) is mainly due to the fact that the internal implementation of [Joda-Time][6] always use a machine-time-like long-primitive (in milliseconds).\r\n\r\n**Null**\r\n\r\nJoda-Time often use NULL as default for system timezone, default locale, current timestamp etc. while JSR-310 almost always rejects NULL values.\r\n\r\n**Precision**\r\n\r\nJSR-310 handles [nanosecond][7] precision while Joda-Time is limited to [millisecond][8] precision. \r\n\r\n**Supported fields:**\r\n\r\nAn overview about supported fields in Java-8 (JSR-310) is given by some classes in the temporal-package (for example [ChronoField][9] and [WeekFields][10]) while Joda-Time is rather weak on this area - see [DateTimeFieldType][11]. The biggest lack of Joda-Time is here the absence of localized week-related fields. A common feature of both field implementation design is that both are based on values of type long (no other types, not even enums).\r\n\r\n**Enum**\r\n\r\nJSR-310 offers [enums][12] like `DayOfWeek` or `Month` while Joda-Time does not offer this because it was mainly developed in years 2002-2004 before [Java 5][13].\r\n\r\n**Zone API**\r\n\r\na) JSR-310 offers more timezone features than Joda-Time. Latter is not able to yield a programmatical access to the history of timezone offset transitions while JSR-310 is capable to do this.\r\n\r\nb) For your information: JSR-310 has moved its internal timezone repository to a new location and a different format. The old library folder lib/zi does not exist any more.\r\n\r\n**Adjuster vs. Property**\r\n\r\nJSR-310 has introduced the `TemporalAdjuster`-interface as a formalized way to externalize temporal calculations and manipulations, especially for library or framework-writers this is a nice and relative easy way to embed new extensions of JSR-310 (a kind of equivalent to static helper classes for former `java.util.Date`).\r\n\r\nFor most users however, this feature has very limited value because the burden to write code is still with the user. Built-in solutions based on the new `TemporalAdjuster`-concept are not so many, there is currently only the helper class `TemporalAdjusters` with a limited set of manipulations (and the enums `Month` or other temporal types). \r\n\r\nJoda-Time offers a field-package but practice has shown evidence that new field implementations are very hard to code. On the other side Joda-Time offers so-called properties which make some manipulations much easier and more elegant than in JSR-310, for example [property.withMaximumValue()][14].\r\n\r\n**Calendar systems**\r\n\r\nJSR-310 offers 4 extra calendar systems. The most interesting one is [Umalqura][15] (used in Saudi Arabia). The other 3 are: [Minguo][16] (Taiwan), Japanese (only the modern calendar since 1871!) and [ThaiBuddhist][17] (only correct after 1940).\r\n\r\nJoda-Time offers an [Islamic calendar][18] based on calculatory base - not a sighting-based calendar like Umalqura. Thai-Buddhist is also offered by Joda-Time in a similar form, Minguo and the japanese one not. Otherwise Joda-Time offers coptic and ethiopic calendar, too (but without any support for internationalization).\r\n\r\nMore interesting for Europeans: Joda-Time also offers a [Gregorian][19], [Julian][20] and mixed-gregorian-julian calendar. However, the practical value for real historical calculations is limited because important features like different year starts in date history are not supported at all (the same criticism is valid for old `java.util.GregorianCalendar`).\r\n\r\nOther calendars like [Hebrew][21] or [Persian][22] or [Hindu][23] are completely missing in both libraries.\r\n\r\n**Epoch days**\r\n\r\nJSR-310 has the class [JulianFields][24] while Joda-Time (version 2.0) offers some helper methods in the class [DateTimeUtils][25].\r\n\r\n**Clocks**\r\n\r\nJSR-310 has no interface (a design mistake) but an abstract class `java.time.Clock` which can be used for any clock dependency injection. Joda-Time offers the interface [MillisProvider][26] and some helper methods in [DateTimeUtils][27] instead. So this way Joda-Time is also capable of supporting test-driven models with different clocks (mocking etc.).\r\n\r\n**Duration arithmetic**\r\n\r\nBoth libraries support the calculation of time distances in one or more temporal units. However, when handling single-unit-durations the JSR-310-style is obviously nicer (and long-based instead of using int):\r\n\r\nJSR-310 =&amp;gt; `long days = ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(date1, date2);`\r\n\r\nJoda-Time =&amp;gt; `int days = DAYS.daysBetween(date1, date2).getDays();`\r\n\r\nHandling of multiple-unit-durations are also different. Even the calculation results can differ - see this closed [Joda-Time issue][28]. While JSR-310 use a very simple and limited approach to use just the classes `Period` (duration based on years, months and days) and `Duration` (based on seconds and nanoseconds), Joda-Time uses a more sophisticated way using the class `PeriodType` in order to control in which units a duration (Joda-Time call it &quot;Period&quot;) shall be expressed. While the `PeriodType`-API is somehow awkward to use a similar way is not offered by JSR-310 at all. Especially it is not yet possible in JSR-310 to define mixed date and time durations (based on days and hours for example). So be warned if it comes to migration from one library to another. The libraries in discussion are incompatible - despite of partially same class names.\r\n\r\n**Intervals**\r\n\r\nJSR-310 does not support this feature while Joda-Time has limited support. See also this [SO-answer][29].\r\n\r\n**Formatting and Parsing**\r\n\r\nBest way to compare both libraries is to view the equal-named classes [DateTimeFormatterBuilder][30] (JSR-310) and [DateTimeFormatterBuilder][31] (Joda-Time). The JSR-310-variant is a little bit more powerful (can also handle any kind of `TemporalField` provided the field implementor has managed to code some extension points like [resolve()][32]). Most important difference is however - in my opinion: \r\n\r\nJSR-310 can much better parse timezone names (format pattern symbol z) while Joda-Time could not do this at all in its earlier versions and now only in a very limited way.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of JSR-310 is support for standalone month names which is important in languages like Russian or Polish etc. Joda-Time has [no access to such resources][33] - not even on Java-8 platforms.\r\n\r\nThe pattern syntax in JSR-310 is also more flexible than in Joda-Time, allows for optional sections (using square brackets), is more orientated towards CLDR-standard and offers padding (letter symbol p) and more fields.\r\n\r\nOtherwise it should be noted that Joda-Time can format durations using [PeriodFormatter][34]. JSR-310 cannot do this.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nHope this overview helps. All the gathered information is mainly there due to my efforts and investigations how to design and implement a better date-and-time library (nothing is perfect).\r\n\r\n**Update from 2015-06-24:**\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I have found the time to write and [publish a tabular overview][35] for different time libraries in Java. The tables also contain a comparison between Joda-Time v2.8.1 and Java-8 (JSR-310).

Add a loop so that the program plays 10,000 games. Add\n  c ounters that count how many times the player wins, and how many times the\n  player loses. At the end of the 10,000 games, compute the probability of winning\n  [i.e., Wins / (Wins + Losses)] and output this value.

I tried putting</p>\n<p>boolean find = false;</p>\n<p>and placed if (find = true)  within the for loop next to the (fruitMenu.get(j).equalsIgnoreCase(userSearch))\nbut it was s,till giving me the same issue with the else statement.</p>\n<p>Since the if statement works just how I want it to be, I'm just expecting the else statement to print &quot;Cherry is not in the inventory&quot; just once, when the user inputs Cherry and it's not part of the list.</p>\n<p>All your help is greatly appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","tomcat","logging","tomcat9"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":8909811,"reputation":2612,"user_id":6650475,"display_name":"Andrew S"},"score":0,"creation_date":1700499294,"post_id":77517021,"comment_id":136659266,"body_markdown":"Who provided the software?

But there is no default setting for positioning all data points for a doughnut chart.\r\n\r\nIn Excel GUI one need drag each single data label outside the chart to place them. The same would must be done using Apache POI. Much code and much math will be needed to calculate the single positions.\r\n\r\nGiven a radius to shift the single data labels. This is in percent of plot area.\r\n\r\nGiven the sum of all values which fill the full circle of 360 degrees.\r\n\r\nThen for each data points a data label must be set.\r\n\r\nThe position shifting (`dX` and `dY`) needs to be calculated using [trigonometric functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions#Right-angled_triangle_definitions) where the trigonometry looks like so:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThe current angle `alpha` is dependent on relation of cumulative value to full circle. Take cumulative values at half value - because data labels are positioned at half of segment.\r\n\r\nThen sin(angle) = opposite side / hypotenuse, where opposite side is `dX`, hypotenuse is `radius`.\r\n\r\nAlso cos(angle) = adjacent side / hypotenuse, where adjacent side is `dY`, hypotenuse is `radius`. Because y grows top down, not buttom up, this must be negated (`*-1`).\r\n\r\nComplete Example:\r\n\r\n    import java.io.FileOutputStream;\r\n    import java.io.IOException;\r\n    \r\n    import org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.Cell;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.Row;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.ss.util.CellRangeAddress;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.xddf.usermodel.chart.LegendPosition;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.xddf.usermodel.chart.XDDFChartData;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.xddf.usermodel.chart.XDDFChartLegend;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.xddf.usermodel.chart.XDDFDataSource;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.xddf.usermodel.chart.XDDFDataSourcesFactory;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.xddf.usermodel.chart.XDDFNumericalDataSource;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.xddf.usermodel.chart.XDDFDoughnutChartData;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.xddf.usermodel.chart.ChartTypes;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFChart;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFClientAnchor;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFDrawing;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFSheet;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFWorkbook;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.DefaultIndexedColorMap;\r\n    \r\n    public class DoughnutChartXDDF {\r\n    \r\n      public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\r\n        try (XSSFWorkbook wb = new XSSFWorkbook()) {\r\n          XSSFSheet sheet = wb.createSheet(&quot;doughnutChart&quot;);\r\n          final int NUM_OF_ROWS = 2;\r\n          final int NUM_OF_COLUMNS = 10;\r\n    \r\n          // Create a row and put some cells in it.

But there is no default setting for positioning all data points for a doughnut chart.</p>\n<p>In Excel GUI one need drag each single data label outside the chart to place them. The same would must be done using Apache POI. Much code and much math will be needed to calculate the single positions.</p>\n<p>Given a radius to shift the single data labels. This is in percent of plot area.</p>\n<p>Given the sum of all values which fill the full circle of 360 degrees.</p>\n<p>Then for each data points a data label must be set.</p>\n<p>The position shifting (<code>dX</code> and <code>dY</code>) needs to be calculated using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions#Right-angled_triangle_definitions\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">trigonometric functions</a> where the trigonometry looks like so:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qBiLa.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qBiLa.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>The current angle <code>alpha</code> is dependent on relation of cumulative value to full circle.

Specifically, I want to add additional behavior to existing controllers without modifying their code directly.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the best approach to implement the decorator pattern in JavaFX controllers?\r\nAre there any specific considerations or best practices when applying this design pattern in the context of JavaFX?\r\nCan you provide a simple example or code snippet demonstrating how to create a decorator for a JavaFX controller?\r\n\r\nI have different FXML files with Controller with common parts.  The Common Parts:\r\n      \r\n    @FXML\r\n    public Text Text1;\r\n    @FXML\r\n    public Text Text2;\r\n    @FXML\r\n    public TextField ID_IN;//Common ID id input field\r\n    @FXML\r\n    public Button Save; //Edit and Add Save button\r\n    @FXML\r\n    public Button Close;\r\n\r\n    \r\n    @Override\r\n    public void showOutsideElements() {\r\n        ID_IN.setVisible(true);\r\n        Close.setVisible(true);\r\n        Save.setVisible(true);\r\n        Text1.setVisible(true);\r\n        Text2.setVisible(true);\r\n    }\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void hideOutsideElements() {\r\n        ID_IN.setVisible(false);\r\n        Close.setVisible(false);\r\n        Save.setVisible(false);\r\n        Text1.setVisible(false);\r\n        Text2.setVisible(false);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI would like to hide and show these elements with the decorated version.\r\n\r\n    @FXML\r\n    public void showOutsideElements() {\r\n        super.showOutsideElements();\r\n        SearchFile.setVisible(true);\r\n        AppRe_IN.setVisible(true);\r\n    }\r\n    @FXML\r\n    public void hideOutsideElements() {\r\n        super.hideOutsideElements();\r\n        SearchFile.setVisible(false);\r\n        AppRe_IN.setVisible(false);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMy code would be more structured with this design pattern, but it seems like the FXML elements can only be accede by the controller.\r\n\r\nHere is the actual code:\r\n\r\nThis is my Base controller:\r\n\r\n    package main.tooldatabase.controller;\r\n    \r\n    import javafx.collections.FXCollections;\r\n
