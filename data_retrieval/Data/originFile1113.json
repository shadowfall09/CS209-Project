Which would be equal to `m - currentElement % m`. If the *difference* is smaller or equal to `k` (it can cave this difference) it should be added to the *list* (`differences` in the code below) and also accumulated in a variable which is meant to store the *total difference* (`totalDiff`). All the elements which produce *difference* that exceeds `k` would be omitted.\r\n\r\n* If the *total difference* is less than or equal to `k` - we are done, the return value would be equal to the number of elements divisible by `m` *plus* the size of the *list of differences*.\r\n\r\n* Otherwise, we need to apply the logic of the *Knapsack problem* to the *list of differences*.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind the method `getBestCount()` (which is an implementation *Knapsack problem*) boils down to generating the &quot;2D&quot; array (a nested array of length equal to the size of the *list of differences* `+1`, in which every inner array having the length of `k+1`) and populating it with maximum values that could be achieved for various states of the *Knapsack*.\r\n\r\nEach element of this array would represent the maximum total number of elements which can be adjusted to make them divisible by `m` for the various sizes of the *Knapsack*, i.e. number of items available from the *list of differences*, and different *number of `k`* (in the range from `0` to `k` inclusive).\r\n\r\nThe best way to understand how the algorithm works is to draw a *table* on a piece of paper and fill it with numbers manually (follow the comments in the code, some intermediate variables were introduced only for the purpose of making it easier to grasp, and also see the Wiki article linked above).\r\n\r\nFor instance, if the given array is `[1, 8, 3, 9, 5]`, `k=3` and `m=3`. We can see `2` elements divisible by `m` - `3` and `9`. Numbers `1, 8, 5` would give the following *list of differences* `[2, 1, 1]`. Applying the logic of the *Knapsack* algorithm, we should get the following table:\r\n```\r\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\r\n[0, 0, 1, 1]\r\n[0, 1, 1, 2]\r\n[0, 1, 2, 2]\r\n```\r\nWe are interested in the value right most column of the last row, which is `2` *plus* `2` (number of elements divisible by `3`) would give us `4`.\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; that code provided below can dial only with &lt;b&gt;positive&lt;/b&gt; numbers.

If the <em>difference</em> is smaller or equal to <code>k</code> (it can cave this difference) it should be added to the <em>list</em> (<code>differences</code> in the code below) and also accumulated in a variable which is meant to store the <em>total difference</em> (<code>totalDiff</code>). All the elements which produce <em>difference</em> that exceeds <code>k</code> would be omitted.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If the <em>total difference</em> is less than or equal to <code>k</code> - we are done, the return value would be equal to the number of elements divisible by <code>m</code> <em>plus</em> the size of the <em>list of differences</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Otherwise, we need to apply the logic of the <em>Knapsack problem</em> to the <em>list of differences</em>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The idea behind the method <code>getBestCount()</code> (which is an implementation <em>Knapsack problem</em>) boils down to generating the &quot;2D&quot; array (a nested array of length equal to the size of the <em>list of differences</em> <code>+1</code>, in which every inner array having the length of <code>k+1</code>) and populating it with maximum values that could be achieved for various states of the <em>Knapsack</em>.</p>\n<p>Each element of this array would represent the maximum total number of elements which can be adjusted to make them divisible by <code>m</code> for the various sizes of the <em>Knapsack</em>, i.e. number of items available from the <em>list of differences</em>, and different <em>number of <code>k</code></em> (in the range from <code>0</code> to <code>k</code> inclusive).</p>\n<p>The best way to understand how the algorithm works is to draw a <em>table</em> on a piece of paper and fill it with numbers manually (follow the comments in the code, some intermediate variables were introduced only for the purpose of making it easier to grasp, and also see the Wiki article linked above).</p>\n<p>For instance, if the given array is <code>[1, 8, 3, 9, 5]</code>, <code>k=3</code> and <code>m=3</code>. We can see <code>2</code> elements divisible by <code>m</code> - <code>3</code> and <code>9</code>. Numbers <code>1, 8, 5</code> would give the following <em>list of differences</em> <code>[2, 1, 1]</code>. Applying the logic of the <em>Knapsack</em> algorithm, we should get the following table:</p>\n<pre><code>[0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 1, 1]\n[0, 1, 1, 2]\n[0, 1, 2, 2]\n</code></pre>\n<p>We are interested in the value right most column of the last row, which is <code>2</code> <em>plus</em> <code>2</code> (number of elements divisible by <code>3</code>) would give us <code>4</code>.</p>\n<p><sup><i><b>Note:</b> that code provided below can dial only with <b>positive</b> numbers.

And today finally I figured it out.\r\n\r\nThree Consoles are useful here:\r\nFirebase Console / Project Settings: \r\nhttps://console.firebase.google.com\r\n\r\nGoogle Developer Console / Credentials: \r\nhttps://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials\r\n\r\nLinked Apps: \r\nhttps://play.google.com/apps/publish/\r\n\r\nLooks like you are using firebase and the same here. And of course, we will follow the guide: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/play-games?authuser=0. In my case, we are using Play Games Sign-in.\r\n\r\n To fix those GMS ApiExceptions like DEVELOPER_ERROR (10) / INTERNAL_ERROR (8) / API_NOT_CONNECTED (17) / SIGN_IN_REQUIRED (4), follow this checklist below:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Ignore the Gradle task `signingReport`, this is important, or it&#39;ll create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID automatically with `your.package.name` and SHA1 from `~/.android/debug.keystore` which is error-prone.\r\n2. Create or use your own Key Store files, you can create it from Android Studio / Build / Generate Signed Bundle or APK / Create new... / Choose existing..., (here I created 2 files, one for debug and one for release, hereinafter called debug.jks and release.jks)\r\n3. Get the SHA1 from debug.jks using `keytool -exportcert -alias YOUR_ALIAS -keystore debug.jks -list -v`, paste your debug SHA1 to your Firebase Console. &lt;br&gt;[![Firebase Console][1]][1]&lt;/br&gt; Save the configuration and download the `google-service.json` to your Android Studio properly. Watch out, you only set the debug SHA1 but not the release one. Then Run your App, this process will create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID automatically with the debug SHA1. You can refresh the Google Developer Console / Credentials to check what you have done.\r\n4. DO NOT create OAuth 2.0 Client ID from Google Developer Console / Credentials, all IDs should create automatically from Google service Or Linked Apps.\r\n5. Then you should have two Client IDs on Google Developer Console / Credentials: `Android client for your.package.name (auto created by Google Service)` and `Web client (auto created by Google Service)` Check you `google-service.json` file, it’ll contain two `client_id`, both must be exactly the same as Google Developer Console / Credentials.\r\n6. Make sure you settled in the Firebase console, the Authentication part.\r\n7. Now let’s do Linked Apps. Just like the guide: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/play-games?authuser=0#link_your_firebase_project_to_your_play_publisher_account, but BEWARE there is a huge diff here,  after clicked Authorize your app, the console try to automatically add your Google Play App Signing SHA1 as a client ID ( no the release.jks SHA1, the release.jks SHA1 is an upload key, google play will resign the APK/Bundle with its own key). Feel free to create it, and btw it’s a good hobby to rename the Linked app like ‘Your App Name - Google Play’. And Then refresh the Google Developer Console / Credentials to check.\r\n8. Let’s link two more Apps, named ‘Your App Name - AdHoc’ with the SHA1 from release.jks and ‘Your App Name - Debug’ from debug.jks.\r\n9. Now Generate Signed Bundle or APK.

And today finally I figured it out.</p>\n<p>Three Consoles are useful here:\nFirebase Console / Project Settings:\n<a href=\"https://console.firebase.google.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://console.firebase.google.com</a></p>\n<p>Google Developer Console / Credentials:\n<a href=\"https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials</a></p>\n<p>Linked Apps:\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/apps/publish/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://play.google.com/apps/publish/</a></p>\n<p>Looks like you are using firebase and the same here. And of course, we will follow the guide: <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/play-games?authuser=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/play-games?authuser=0</a>. In my case, we are using Play Games Sign-in.</p>\n<p>To fix those GMS ApiExceptions like DEVELOPER_ERROR (10) / INTERNAL_ERROR (8) / API_NOT_CONNECTED (17) / SIGN_IN_REQUIRED (4), follow this checklist below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ignore the Gradle task <code>signingReport</code>, this is important, or it'll create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID automatically with <code>your.package.name</code> and SHA1 from <code>~/.android/debug.keystore</code> which is error-prone.</li>\n<li>Create or use your own Key Store files, you can create it from Android Studio / Build / Generate Signed Bundle or APK / Create new... / Choose existing..., (here I created 2 files, one for debug and one for release, hereinafter called debug.jks and release.jks)</li>\n<li>Get the SHA1 from debug.jks using <code>keytool -exportcert -alias YOUR_ALIAS -keystore debug.jks -list -v</code>, paste your debug SHA1 to your Firebase Console. <br><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1yp8G.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1yp8G.gif\" alt=\"Firebase Console\" /></a> Save the configuration and download the <code>google-service.json</code> to your Android Studio properly. Watch out, you only set the debug SHA1 but not the release one. Then Run your App, this process will create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID automatically with the debug SHA1. You can refresh the Google Developer Console / Credentials to check what you have done.</li>\n<li>DO NOT create OAuth 2.0 Client ID from Google Developer Console / Credentials, all IDs should create automatically from Google service Or Linked Apps.</li>\n<li>Then you should have two Client IDs on Google Developer Console / Credentials: <code>Android client for your.package.name (auto created by Google Service)</code> and <code>Web client (auto created by Google Service)</code> Check you <code>google-service.json</code> file, it’ll contain two <code>client_id</code>, both must be exactly the same as Google Developer Console / Credentials.</li>\n<li>Make sure you settled in the Firebase console, the Authentication part.</li>\n<li>Now let’s do Linked Apps. Just like the guide: <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/play-games?authuser=0#link_your_firebase_project_to_your_play_publisher_account\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/play-games?authuser=0#link_your_firebase_project_to_your_play_publisher_account</a>, but BEWARE there is a huge diff here,  after clicked Authorize your app, the console try to automatically add your Google Play App Signing SHA1 as a client ID ( no the release.jks SHA1, the release.jks SHA1 is an upload key, google play will resign the APK/Bundle with its own key). Feel free to create it, and btw it’s a good hobby to rename the Linked app like ‘Your App Name - Google Play’. And Then refresh the Google Developer Console / Credentials to check.</li>\n<li>Let’s link two more Apps, named ‘Your App Name - AdHoc’ with the SHA1 from release.jks and ‘Your App Name - Debug’ from debug.jks.</li>\n<li>Now Generate Signed Bundle or APK. Make sure your APK file signed properly. Beware that using Android studio, <code>Run 'YOUR_PROJECT'</code> at debug mode will sign the APK with <code>~/.android/debug.keystore</code> which SHA1 is not the one you are using to create client id.</li>\n<li>ADB install the APK.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Google Developer Console / Credentials should looks like this figure： <br><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TzR1K.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TzR1K.gif\" alt=\"Credentials\" /></a>\nThe Linked Apps should look like this figure: <br><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/k4dDp.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/k4dDp.png\" alt=\"linked apps\" /></a></p>\n<p>Thank you GOOGLE and my fallen hair, good luck to you.</p>\n<p>Relative Answers:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44125344/how-to-sign-your-app-using-the-upload-key/45270329#45270329\">How to sign your app using the upload key</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50671691/test-google-play-games-on-app-signed-with-upload-key\">Test Google Play Games on app signed with upload key</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56065375/testing-games-services-using-upload-key-instead-of-google-play-app-signing-key/56463302#56463302\">Testing Games Services using upload key instead of Google Play App signing key</a></p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4283273,"reputation":12073,"user_id":3501958,"accept_rate":89,"display_name":"hata"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1660362138,"creation_date":1660206601,"answer_id":73317594,"question_id":62128793,"body_markdown":"If you&#39;re using Play Games Services **v2** SDK,\r\n\r\n    implementation &#39;com.google.android.gms:play-services-games-v2:17.0.0&#39;\r\n\r\nI got this error when I tried to sign-in with GoogleSignIn API and Play Games Services **v2** SDK.\r\n\r\nWith v2 SDK, You can&#39;t sign-in or sign-out with GoogleSignIn API, any more.

Is there a different command I can use.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","swing","jfreechart"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":81822,"reputation":204250,"user_id":230513,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"trashgod"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1660359098,"creation_date":1660167449,"answer_id":73312999,"question_id":73176484,"body_markdown":"Your chosen chart factory instantiates a [`LineAndShapeRenderer`][1], so one approach is to make the renderer&#39;s shapes visible for all series, as shown [here][2]; note that the API has [changed][3]:\r\n\r\n    CategoryPlot plot = (CategoryPlot) chart.getPlot();\r\n    LineAndShapeRenderer r = (LineAndShapeRenderer) plot.getRenderer();\r\n    r.setDefaultShapesVisible(true);\r\n\r\nTo enable shapes _only_ for series having a single, non-null value, you&#39;ll have to iterate through the `data` explicitly:\r\n\r\n    DefaultCategoryDataset data = new DefaultCategoryDataset();\r\n    data.addValue(3, &quot;Data1&quot;, LocalDate.now());\r\n    data.addValue(2, &quot;Data2&quot;, LocalDate.now());\r\n    data.addValue(1, &quot;Data2&quot;, LocalDate.now().plusDays(1));\r\n    …\r\n    for (int row = 0; row &lt; data.getRowCount(); row++) {\r\n        int count = 0;\r\n        for (int col = 0; col &lt; data.getColumnCount(); col++) {\r\n            count += data.getValue(row, col) != null ? 1 : 0;\r\n        }\r\n        if (count == 1) {\r\n            r.setSeriesShapesVisible(row, true);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n[![image][4]][4]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/javadoc/org/jfree/chart/renderer/category/LineAndShapeRenderer.html\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/43126288/230513\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/jfree/jfreechart#migration\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/H3SjQ.png\r\n\r\n","title":"JFreeChart show one single value","body":"<p>Your chosen chart factory instantiates a <a href=\"https://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/javadoc/org/jfree/chart/renderer/category/LineAndShapeRenderer.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>LineAndShapeRenderer</code></a>, so one approach is to make the renderer's shapes visible for all series, as shown <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/43126288/230513\">here</a>; note that the API has <a href=\"https://github.com/jfree/jfreechart#migration\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">changed</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>CategoryPlot plot = (CategoryPlot) chart.getPlot();\nLineAndShapeRenderer r = (LineAndShapeRenderer) plot.getRenderer();\nr.setDefaultShapesVisible(true);\n</code></pre>\n<p>To enable shapes <em>only</em> for series having a single, non-null value, you'll have to iterate through the <code>data</code> explicitly:</p>\n<pre><code>DefaultCategoryDataset data = new DefaultCategoryDataset();\ndata.addValue(3, &quot;Data1&quot;, LocalDate.now());\ndata.addValue(2, &quot;Data2&quot;, LocalDate.now());\ndata.addValue(1, &quot;Data2&quot;, LocalDate.now().plusDays(1));\n…\nfor (int row = 0; row &lt; data.getRowCount(); row++) {\n    int count = 0;\n    for (int col = 0; col &lt; data.getColumnCount(); col++) {\n        count += data.getValue(row, col) != null ? 1 : 0;\n    }\n    if (count == 1) {\n        r.setSeriesShapesVisible(row, true);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/H3SjQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/H3SjQ.png\" alt=\"image\" /></a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":20065589,"reputation":23,"user_id":15999676,"display_name":"OcR19"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":162,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1660359098,"creation_date":1659191759,"question_id":73176484,"body_markdown":"I have a chart where I display the values of a table (stock and date).
