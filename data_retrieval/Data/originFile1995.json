There are 7 message identifiers: REGISTRATION_MESSAGE, REGISTRATION_RESPONSE, DEREGISTRATION_MESSAGE, REQUEST_REGISTERED_USERS, RESPONSE_REGISTERED_USERS, BROADCAST_MESSAGE, and WHISPER_MESSAGE. All in all, I believe that if I can figure out the first message, I can do the other ones pretty easily. I am struggling to understand the concept, along with the know-hows for marshalling and unmarshalling. Currently, this is the snippet of code I am currently struggling on.\r\n[code snippet][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve never messed with bytes so that alone kind of confuses me.

So, if you used a <code>LinkedHashMap</code> when serializing and deserializing, and you originally added the attributes in a specific order, the insertion order of the attributes should be preserved through serialization and deserialization.</p>\n<p>However, I don't know if there is a hacky solution that works with &quot;jsonb&quot; serialization.  So you might need to do the serialization &quot;by hand&quot; rather than using <code>@JsonSerialize</code>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>If you are doing this because you have been told to implement some requirements that prescribe a specific order for the JSON attributes, then that requirements specification is broken.  You should push back.  Point out that what <em>they</em> have asked for is NOT JSON.  If they need things to be ordered in JSON ... they should specify a JSON array.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>References:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16870416\">Does the sequence of the values matter in a JSON object?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4515676\">Keep the order of the JSON keys during JSON conversion to CSV</a></li>\n</ul>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":12281870,"reputation":11,"user_id":8963131,"display_name":"Сергей Аблаев"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1208,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1632689694,"creation_date":1632614187,"question_id":69330867,"body_markdown":"I have a project with Spring Boot with Hibernate.

[*7.1.1 Encryption Operation*][3]. The OAEP digest is used to hash the label, s. [*7.1.1, Step 2a*][3]. As mask generation function RFC 8017 defines MGF1 *exclusively* (s. [*B.2.1 MGF1*][2]), which is therefore generally used in OAEP. MGF1 is based on a digest (MGF1 digest).&lt;br&gt; \r\nRFC 8017 specifies the following default values, s. [*A.2.1 RSAES-OAEP*][4]: MGF1, SHA1 for the OAEP and MGF1 digests, and an empty label.\r\n\r\nAlthough SHA-1 is now deemed insecure, there are no known insecurities in the context of OAEP, s. [here][5]. Nevertheless, SHA256 is meanwhile often used, as a preventive measure or in the course of eliminating SHA-1 from the ecosystem.&lt;br&gt; \r\nFurthermore, RFC 8017 does not exclude the use of different digests for the OAEP and the MGF1 digest, as in your example.&lt;br&gt;\r\nTherefore, an implementation should allow the independent specification of both digests, which the crypto/rsa package fails to do.\r\n\r\nTo allow both digests to be specified separately, a second parameter must be used in the `EncryptOAEP()` and `DecryptOAEP()` functions to pass the MGF1 digest, which is then applied to MGF1:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc EncryptOAEP(hash hash.Hash, hashMGF1 hash.Hash, random io.Reader, pub *rsa.PublicKey, msg []byte, label []byte) ([]byte, error) {\r\n    ...\r\n\thashMGF1.Reset()\r\n\tmgf1XOR(seed, hashMGF1, db) \r\n\tmgf1XOR(db, hashMGF1, seed) \r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand analogously for `DecryptOAEP()`.\r\n\r\nThis could best be implemented with a corresponding adjustment of the crypto/rsa package itself. Alternatively, as a workaround, the required functions can be copied from the crypto/rsa package and adapted, as in the following code inclusive test:\r\n\r\n```go\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n\t&quot;crypto/rand&quot;\r\n\t&quot;crypto/subtle&quot;\r\n\t&quot;crypto/rsa&quot;\r\n\t&quot;crypto/sha256&quot;\r\n\t&quot;crypto/sha1&quot;\r\n\t&quot;crypto/x509&quot;\r\n\t&quot;encoding/pem&quot;\r\n\t&quot;encoding/base64&quot;\r\n\t&quot;hash&quot;\r\n\t&quot;errors&quot;\r\n\t&quot;io&quot;\r\n\t&quot;math/big&quot;\r\n\t&quot;sync&quot;\r\n\t&quot;fmt&quot;\r\n\t)\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\r\n\tvar publicKeyData = `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\r\nMIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAoZ67dtUTLxoXnNEzRBFB\r\nmwukEJGC+y69cGgpNbtElQj3m4Aft/7cu9qYbTNguTSnCDt7uovZNb21u1vpZwKH\r\nyVgFEGO4SA8RNnjhJt2D7z8RDMWX3saody7jo9TKlrPABLZGo2o8vadW8Dly/v+I\r\nd0YDheCkVCoCEeUjQ8koXZhTwhYkGPu+vkdiqX5cUaiVTu1uzt591aO5Vw/hV4DI\r\nhFKnOTnYXnpXiwRwtPyYoGTa64yWfi2t0bv99qz0BgDjQjD0civCe8LRXGGhyB1U\r\n1aHjDDGEnulTYJyEqCzNGwBpzEHUjqIOXElFjt55AFGpCHAuyuoXoP3gQvoSj6RC\r\nsQIDAQAB\r\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----`\r\n\r\n\tvar privateKeyData = `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----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\r\n9VDoPXBgf4dufgNoS3xP4NS4H5oPg0gPS0vwpWspWqplLM+N/kGj\r\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`\r\n\t\r\n\tsecretMessage := []byte(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot;)\r\n\tlabel := []byte(&quot;&quot;)\r\n\trng := rand.Reader\r\n\r\n\t// Encryption -------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\t\r\n\t// Load public key\r\n\tpubKeyBlock, _ := pem.Decode([]byte(publicKeyData))\r\n\tvar rsaPublicKey *rsa.PublicKey\r\n\tpubInterface, parseErr := x509.ParsePKIXPublicKey(pubKeyBlock.Bytes)\r\n\tif parseErr != nil {\r\n\t\tfmt.Println(&quot;Load public key error&quot;)\r\n\t\tpanic(parseErr)\r\n\t}\r\n\trsaPublicKey = pubInterface.(*rsa.PublicKey)\r\n\r\n\tciphertext, err := EncryptOAEP(sha256.New(), sha1.New(), rng, rsaPublicKey, secretMessage, label)\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n    \t\tfmt.Printf(&quot;Error from encryption: %s\\n&quot;, err)\r\n    \t\treturn\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// Decryption -------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\t\r\n\t// Load private key\r\n\tprivateKeyBlock, _ := pem.Decode([]byte(privateKeyData))\r\n\tvar rsaPrivateKey *rsa.PrivateKey\r\n\trsaPrivateKey, _ = x509.ParsePKCS1PrivateKey(privateKeyBlock.Bytes)\r\n\t\r\n\tdecrypted, err := DecryptOAEP(sha256.New(), sha1.New(), rng, rsaPrivateKey, ciphertext, label)\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n    \t\tfmt.Printf(&quot;Error from decryption: %s\\n&quot;, err)\r\n    \t\treturn\r\n\t}\r\n\tfmt.Println(&quot;Go Encryption/Decryption : &quot;

The OAEP digest is used to hash the label, s. <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8017#section-7.1.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>7.1.1, Step 2a</em></a>. As mask generation function RFC 8017 defines MGF1 <em>exclusively</em> (s. <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8017#appendix-B.2.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>B.2.1 MGF1</em></a>), which is therefore generally used in OAEP. MGF1 is based on a digest (MGF1 digest).<br>\nRFC 8017 specifies the following default values, s. <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8017#appendix-A.2.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>A.2.1 RSAES-OAEP</em></a>: MGF1, SHA1 for the OAEP and MGF1 digests, and an empty label.</p>\n<p>Although SHA-1 is now deemed insecure, there are no known insecurities in the context of OAEP, s. <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/a/112032\">here</a>. Nevertheless, SHA256 is meanwhile often used, as a preventive measure or in the course of eliminating SHA-1 from the ecosystem.<br>\nFurthermore, RFC 8017 does not exclude the use of different digests for the OAEP and the MGF1 digest, as in your example.<br>\nTherefore, an implementation should allow the independent specification of both digests, which the crypto/rsa package fails to do.</p>\n<p>To allow both digests to be specified separately, a second parameter must be used in the <code>EncryptOAEP()</code> and <code>DecryptOAEP()</code> functions to pass the MGF1 digest, which is then applied to MGF1:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-golang prettyprint-override\"><code>func EncryptOAEP(hash hash.Hash, hashMGF1 hash.Hash, random io.Reader, pub *rsa.PublicKey, msg []byte, label []byte) ([]byte, error) {\n    ...\n    hashMGF1.Reset()\n    mgf1XOR(seed, hashMGF1, db) \n    mgf1XOR(db, hashMGF1, seed) \n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>and analogously for <code>DecryptOAEP()</code>.</p>\n<p>This could best be implemented with a corresponding adjustment of the crypto/rsa package itself.

While in case of lambda expression this keyword refers to the object of the enclosing type and super will refer to the enclosing class’s super class.</p>\n\n<pre><code>//AIC\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        final int cnt = 0; \n        Runnable r = new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                int cnt = 5;    \n                System.out.println(\"in run\" + cnt);\n            }\n        };\n\n        Thread t = new Thread(r);\n        t.start();\n    }\n\n//Lambda\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        final int cnt = 0; \n        Runnable r = ()-&gt;{\n            int cnt = 5; //compilation error\n            System.out.println(\"in run\"+cnt);};\n        Thread t = new Thread(r);\n        t.start();\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>3) Performance</strong></p>\n\n<p>At runtime anonymous inner classes require class loading, memory allocation and object initialization and invocation of a non-static method while lambda expression is pure compile time activity and don’t incur extra cost during runtime. So performance of lambda expression is better as compare to anonymous inner classes.**</p>\n\n<p>**I do realize that this point is not entirely true .

I am using Application contexts and there is no static field in my app. I have tried to dump heap and analyze it with MAT, however i couldn't find anything good. I was hoping someone could show me right direction to find the roots of memory leak or other possible explanation of the problem. </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","memory-leaks","heap-memory"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":319873,"reputation":87612,"user_id":637853,"accept_rate":50,"display_name":"Thomas"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1317743955,"creation_date":1317743600,"answer_id":7650635,"question_id":7650505,"body_markdown":"AFAIK, heapdumps are only automatically generated if you specify that option, at least in Oracle&#39;s JVM (don&#39;t know about the others, but I doubt they do it automatically).\r\n\r\nIn most cases you have to trigger heap dump generation manually.\r\n\r\nThere are also ways to programmatically create a heap dump, but those are JVM specific and depend on how and when the programmer calls them.

The somewhat longer answer is that there is no good way to terminate a thread in Java unless it cooperates. [Thread#stop][1] should not be used and is not available on [ExecutorService][2]. When you shutdown an executor service it can ask jobs to stop by interrupting them, but it cannot force them to stop. If `doHeavyWork` handles interrupts and stops, then it will exit gracefully or with an exception (depending on how you have designed it) and the next stage can proceed.\r\n\r\nHonestly I&#39;m not sure if the code in `thenApply` will run if the executor service has been stopped.
