This seems odd to me as the API demands different.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2562742,"reputation":5917,"user_id":2851311,"display_name":"hfontanez"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1642912838,"creation_date":1642912838,"answer_id":70819165,"question_id":70819158,"body_markdown":"`j &lt;= finalCheck.size()` should be `j &lt; finalCheck.size()`.\r\n\r\nFor an array of size `x`, In Java, the last index is `x - 1` because arrays in Java start at index 0.","title":"Getting Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 12 out of bounds for length 12 at voteR.VoteR.main(VoteR.java:43)","body":"<p><code>j &lt;= finalCheck.size()</code> should be <code>j &lt; finalCheck.size()</code>.</p>\n<p>For an array of size <code>x</code>, In Java, the last index is <code>x - 1</code> because arrays in Java start at index 0.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":23992930,"reputation":1,"user_id":17978808,"display_name":"Java_Junior"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":70,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1642912914,"accepted_answer_id":70819165,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1642912838,"creation_date":1642912612,"question_id":70819158,"body_markdown":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\t\tBufferedReader bf = null;\r\n\t\tBufferedWriter bw = null;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tFileReader fr = new FileReader(&quot;File.txt&quot;);\r\n\t\t\tFileWriter fw = new FileWriter(&quot;Output.txt&quot;);\r\n\t\t\tbf = new BufferedReader(fr);\r\n\t\t\tbw = new BufferedWriter(fw);\r\n\t\t\t//Skip the first line\r\n\t\t\tbf.readLine(); \r\n\t\t\tString line;\r\n\t\t\tList&lt;String&gt; finalCheck = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();\r\n\t\t\t//Read the file line by line and add the first number of each line (as a String) to the finalCheck List\r\n\t\t\twhile((line = bf.readLine()) != null){\r\n\t\t\t\tString [] idArray = line.split(&quot;,&quot;);\r\n\t\t\t\tString idCheck = idArray[0];\r\n\t\t\t\tfinalCheck.add(idCheck);\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t//Checking for any duplicates within the ID&#39;s and displaying them on\r\n\t\t\tint i = 0;\r\n\t\t\tint j = 0;\r\n\t\t\tfor (i = 0; i &lt;= finalCheck.size(); i++) {\r\n\t\t\t\tfor (j = i + 1; j &lt;= finalCheck.size(); j++) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tString [] array = new String[finalCheck.size()];\r\n\t\t\t\t\tfinalCheck.toArray(array);\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif(array[i].equals(array[j])) { //This is Line 43\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfw.write(&quot;Duplicate at line: &quot; + array[i]);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\r\n\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\r\n\t\t\tSystem.err.println(&quot;File not found&quot;);\r\n\t\t} catch (IOException e) {\r\n\t\t\tSystem.err.println(&quot;Cannot read the file&quot;);\r\n\t\t} finally {\r\n\t\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\t\tbf.close();\r\n\t\t\t\tbw.flush();\r\n\t\t\t\tbw.close();\r\n\t\t\t} catch (IOException e) {\r\n\t\t\t\t// TODO Auto-generated catch block\r\n\t\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\nI keep getting the error message shown in the title, and I am not sure how to fix it.

So it throws an exception because it cannot deserialize it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p>If this is correct, there are a few approaches to solving this.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Change the way that you represent the enum values so that the in-memory <code>enum</code> types don't depend on the locale settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Change the enum converter class so that it map the locale specific in-memory enums to a local independent representation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Change the enum converter class so that it understands all of the possible the locale specific representations in the database ... and maps to the appropriate one when deserializing.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>When you switch system the system locale reset the database; i.e. throw away all of the data.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I can't tell you which would be more appropriate.  It depends on your application.</p>\n<p><sup>(Q: And I give you example code, or a reference?

Removing the <code>@NotNull</code> annotation because you're sure it's right is tantamount to changing all of your return types to <code>Object</code> because you know in your head what types the functions return. If you think</p>\n<pre><code>String getName(String prefix) { ... }\n</code></pre>\n<p>looks better than</p>\n<pre><code>Object getName(Object prefix) { ... }\n</code></pre>\n<p>then you should think</p>\n<pre><code>@NotNull String getName(@NotNull String prefix) { ... }\n</code></pre>\n<p>looks even better. It's a stronger guarantee.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":20230349,"reputation":105,"user_id":14837054,"display_name":"jaylawl"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":443,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1642895876,"creation_date":1642874221,"question_id":70815612,"body_markdown":"Random example: In the source code of one of my programs I have this method:\r\n```\r\n    public @NotNull Currency[] getCurrencies() {\r\n        return this.currencies.values().toArray(new Currency[0]);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich, after being compiled, gets turned into the following by my IDE (Intellij):\r\n```\r\n    @NotNull\r\n    public Currency[] getCurrencies() {\r\n        Currency[] var10000 = (Currency[])this.currencies.values().toArray(new Currency[0]);\r\n        if (var10000 == null) {\r\n            $$$reportNull$$$0(4);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return var10000;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n`this.currencies` refers to `private final ConcurrentHashMap&lt;String, Currency&gt; currencies = new ConcurrentHashMap();` - which means that only via means of reflection or cosmic rays causing bit flips, the method `getCurrencies()` could ever return `null`.\r\n\r\n- Should I - in such cases where there is no chance for a `null` being returned - forgo the usage of the `@NotNull` annotation?\r\n- Does the annotation even have significant impact on performance, or do the benefits of having the annotation outweigh the performance impact?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n/edit:\r\nI am using the annotation package `org.jetbrains.annotations`","title":"Do @NotNull annotations on getters have signifcant impacts on performance?","body":"<p>Random example: In the source code of one of my programs I have this method:</p>\n<pre><code>    public @NotNull Currency[] getCurrencies() {\n        return this.currencies.values().toArray(new Currency[0]);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which, after being compiled, gets turned into the following by my IDE (Intellij):</p>\n<pre><code>    @NotNull\n    public Currency[] getCurrencies() {\n        Currency[] var10000 = (Currency[])this.currencies.values().toArray(new Currency[0]);\n        if (var10000 == null) {\n            $$$reportNull$$$0(4);\n        }\n\n        return var10000;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>this.currencies</code> refers to <code>private final ConcurrentHashMap&lt;String, Currency&gt; currencies = new ConcurrentHashMap();</code> - which means that only via means of reflection or cosmic rays causing bit flips, the method <code>getCurrencies()</code> could ever return <code>null</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Should I - in such cases where there is no chance for a <code>null</code> being returned - forgo the usage of the <code>@NotNull</code> annotation?</li>\n<li>Does the annotation even have significant impact on performance, or do the benefits of having the annotation outweigh the performance impact?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n<p>/edit:\nI am using the annotation package <code>org.jetbrains.annotations</code></p>\n"},{"tags":["java","sockets"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2645973,"reputation":65777,"user_id":2288659,"accept_rate":90,"display_name":"Silvio Mayolo"},"score":2,"creation_date":1642886337,"post_id":70817197,"comment_id":125193801,"body_markdown":"If you&#39;re using Putty, you need to set it to Telnet mode, or just use a Telnet client directly.

Basically, if I input an IP and Port, I want the app to listen to any text-type traffic that is sent to that IP and port.\r\n\r\nI tried using some code I found and started adjusting it to meet my needs. \r\n\r\n```\r\npackage localHostApp;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.*;  \r\nimport java.net.*;  \r\n\r\npublic class Server2 {  \r\n\r\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args){  \r\n\r\n\t\ttry{  \r\n\t\t\tServerSocket ss=new ServerSocket(1234);  \r\n\t\t\tSocket s=ss.accept();//establishes connection   \r\n\t\t\tDataInputStream dis=new DataInputStream(s.getInputStream());  \r\n\t\t\tString  str=(String)dis.readUTF();  \r\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;message= &quot;+str);  \r\n\r\n\t\t\tss.close();  \r\n\r\n\t\t}catch(Exception e){System.out.println(e);}  \r\n\r\n\t}  \r\n}  \r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this code only seems to work if you also have a &quot;client&quot; app that is also using Java socket to connect like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport java.io.*;  \r\nimport java.net.*;  \r\npublic class MyClient {  \r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {  \r\ntry{      \r\nSocket s=new Socket(&quot;localhost&quot;,1234);  \r\nDataOutputStream dout=new DataOutputStream(s.getOutputStream());  \r\ndout.writeUTF(&quot;Hello Server&quot;);  \r\ndout.flush();  \r\ndout.close();  \r\ns.close();  \r\n}catch(Exception e){System.out.println(e);}  \r\n}  \r\n}  \r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run the server code and the client code, the client sends traffic to the server which displays in the console just fine. However, if I try to connect to the server with another app (like PUTTY) to just send raw text to the server, it doesn&#39;t display. It shows that it connects, but doesn&#39;t receive the text.\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing here? Should a socket connection in Java just be able to read and display whatever information is sent to that IP and port?\r\n\r\nAgain, sorry for the noob question.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- UPDATED ---\r\n\r\nSo I incorporated the new approach like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport java.io.*;\r\nimport java.net.*;\r\nimport java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;\r\n\r\npublic class Server {\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args){\r\n\r\n        try{\r\n            ServerSocket ss=new ServerSocket();\r\n            Socket s=ss.accept();//establishes connection\r\n            var rawIn = ss.getInputStream();\r\n            var in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(rawIn, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)); {\r\n\r\n        while (true){\r\n            String cmd = in.readLine().trim();\r\n            if (cmd == null) break; //client is hung up\r\n            if (cmd.isEmpty()) continue; //empty line was sent\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Client sent: &quot; + cmd);\r\n        }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        }catch(Exception e){System.out.println(e);}\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}  \r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the var rawIn = ss.getInputStream, I am getting an error &quot;Cannot resolve method &#39;getInputStream&#39; in &#39;ServerSocket&#39;\r\n\r\nDid I incorporate the suggestion below incorrectly?\r\n\r\n----- UPDATE 2 ----\r\n\r\nFound an error in how I incorporated it previously. (used ss.getInputStream instead of s.getInputStream).\r\n\r\nNow I can compile and run without error, but it immediately says socket is not bound yet and exits. Do I need to specifically bind the IP and Port for it to sit and listen?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---- UPDATE 3 -----\r\n\r\nI think I am getting dangerously close.

Basically, if I input an IP and Port, I want the app to listen to any text-type traffic that is sent to that IP and port.</p>\n<p>I tried using some code I found and started adjusting it to meet my needs.</p>\n<pre><code>package localHostApp;\n\nimport java.io.*;  \nimport java.net.*;  \n\npublic class Server2 {  \n\n    public static void main(String[] args){  \n\n        try{  \n            ServerSocket ss=new ServerSocket(1234);  \n            Socket s=ss.accept();//establishes connection   \n            DataInputStream dis=new DataInputStream(s.getInputStream());  \n            String  str=(String)dis.readUTF();  \n            System.out.println(&quot;message= &quot;+str);  \n\n            ss.close();  \n\n        }catch(Exception e){System.out.println(e);}  \n\n    }  \n}  \n</code></pre>\n<p>However, this code only seems to work if you also have a &quot;client&quot; app that is also using Java socket to connect like this:</p>\n<pre><code>import java.io.*;  \nimport java.net.*;  \npublic class MyClient {  \npublic static void main(String[] args) {  \ntry{      \nSocket s=new Socket(&quot;localhost&quot;,1234);  \nDataOutputStream dout=new DataOutputStream(s.getOutputStream());  \ndout.writeUTF(&quot;Hello Server&quot;);  \ndout.flush();  \ndout.close();  \ns.close();  \n}catch(Exception e){System.out.println(e);}  \n}  \n}  \n</code></pre>\n<p>When I run the server code and the client code, the client sends traffic to the server which displays in the console just fine. However, if I try to connect to the server with another app (like PUTTY) to just send raw text to the server, it doesn't display. It shows that it connects, but doesn't receive the text.</p>\n<p>What am I missing here? Should a socket connection in Java just be able to read and display whatever information is sent to that IP and port?</p>\n<p>Again, sorry for the noob question.</p>\n<p>--- UPDATED ---</p>\n<p>So I incorporated the new approach like this:</p>\n<pre><code>import java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;\n\npublic class Server {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args){\n\n        try{\n            ServerSocket ss=new ServerSocket();\n            Socket s=ss.accept();//establishes connection\n            var rawIn = ss.getInputStream();\n            var in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(rawIn, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)); {\n\n        while (true){\n            String cmd = in.readLine().trim();\n            if (cmd == null) break; //client is hung up\n            if (cmd.isEmpty()) continue; //empty line was sent\n            System.out.println(&quot;Client sent: &quot; + cmd);\n        }\n            }\n\n        }catch(Exception e){System.out.println(e);}\n\n    }\n}  \n</code></pre>\n<p>On the var rawIn = ss.getInputStream, I am getting an error &quot;Cannot resolve method 'getInputStream' in 'ServerSocket'</p>\n<p>Did I incorporate the suggestion below incorrectly?</p>\n<p>----- UPDATE 2 ----</p>\n<p>Found an error in how I incorporated it previously. (used ss.getInputStream instead of s.getInputStream).</p>\n<p>Now I can compile and run without error, but it immediately says socket is not bound yet and exits. Do I need to specifically bind the IP and Port for it to sit and listen?</p>\n<p>---- UPDATE 3 -----</p>\n<p>I think I am getting dangerously close. Here is the code I have in place currently.</p>\n<pre><code>import java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\nimport java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;\n\npublic class Server {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args){\n\n        try{\n            ServerSocket ss=new ServerSocket(1234, 1, 127.0.0.1);\n            Socket s=ss.accept();//establishes connection\n            var rawIn = s.getInputStream();\n            var in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(rawIn, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)); {\n\n        while (true){\n            String cmd = in.readLine().trim();\n            if (cmd == null) break; //client is hung up\n            if (cmd.isEmpty()) continue; //empty line was sent\n            System.out.println(&quot;Client sent: &quot; + cmd);\n        }\n            }\n\n        }catch(Exception e){System.out.println(e);}\n\n    }\n}  \n</code></pre>\n<p>I am getting an error for my bind address that it is looking for a ')' or ';'.

I feel like it is a focus subsystem issue or that I should maybe be using multiple threads?</p>\n<pre><code>import java.awt.Color;\nimport java.awt.Dimension;\nimport java.awt.event.WindowEvent;\n\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\nimport javax.swing.JPanel;\n\n@SuppressWarnings(&quot;serial&quot;)\npublic class Frame extends JFrame {\n    private Dimension dimension;\n    private final int WIDTH, HEIGHT;\n    private JPanel screen;\n    public Frame(int width, int height) {\n        WIDTH = width;\n        HEIGHT = height;\n        dimension = new Dimension(WIDTH, HEIGHT);\n        this.setPreferredSize(dimension);\n        this.setResizable(false);\n        this.setMinimumSize(dimension);\n        this.setMaximumSize(dimension);\n        this.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n        this.pack();\n        this.setVisible(true);\n        this.setTitle(&quot;Galaga&quot;);\n        this.setBackground(Color.black);\n        this.setForeground(Color.white);\n        screen = new LevelOneScreen(dimension);\n        this.getContentPane().add(screen);\n        screen.requestFocus();\n        screen.requestFocusInWindow();\n    }\n\n    public void display() {\n        this.pack();\n        this.setVisible(true);\n        this.repaint();\n        if(screen instanceof LevelOneScreen &amp;&amp;

I apologize for the long post but I believe it important that I mention everything.</p>\n<p>I designed the system to act as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I receive a notification request, which is created in a separate table</li>\n<li>I receive a token that indicates which users should get the notification</li>\n<li>I fetch the users via a mapped class that is used as a predicate inside of a findAll method (QueryDSL)</li>\n<li>I created a relational table taht contains the notificationId, talentId and an extra 'sent' column. Every talent that should receive the message is added to this table along with the notificationId</li>\n<li>I have a @Scheduled method that picks up a portion of the notification/talent relations and sends out the notification periodically</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My Async configuration class is as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>@Component\n@Configuration\n@EnableAsync\npublic class AsyncConfiguration implements AsyncConfigurer {\n\n\n    @Override\n    public Executor getAsyncExecutor() {\n        ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();\n\n        executor.setMaxPoolSize(5);\n        executor.setCorePoolSize(5);\n        executor.setThreadNamePrefix(&quot;asyncExec-&quot;);\n        executor.initialize();\n\n        return executor;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler getAsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler() {\n        return (ex, method, params) -&gt; {\n            System.out.println(&quot;Exception with message :&quot; + ex.getMessage());\n            System.out.println(&quot;Method :&quot; + method);\n            System.out.println(&quot;Number of parameters :&quot; + params.length);\n        };\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>My user entity has the following mapping:</p>\n<pre><code>@OneToMany(mappedBy = &quot;talent&quot;, cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)\nprivate List&lt;TalentRoleNotificationRelations&gt;

You BLOAT the data and also make using that data difficult. \r\n\r\n- Say for example you wanted to do a search for foods that have 1000 calories or more this would require a pretty complex query or you would load ALL the database and then loop through the foods and then the units.\r\n\r\nI would say that `@Embedded` is the method to use. Along with using `@Ignore` (the opposite i.e. exclude the member variable from being a column). i.e. you would @Ignore the List&lt;FoodUnitsData&gt; in the Foods class.\r\n\r\n- With `@Embedded` you can then easily use individual values in queries.\r\n\r\n- You could then do something like `SELECT * FROM the_table_used_for_the_foodunitsdata WHERE calory &gt; 1000` and you would get a List of FoodUnitsData returned. SQLite will do this pretty efficiently.\r\n\r\n**Working Example**\r\n\r\nSo putting the above into a working example:-\r\n\r\nFirst the **Foods** class and adding the @Ignore annotation :-\r\n\r\n    @Entity(tableName = &quot;food_data&quot;) // ADDED to make it usable as a Room table\r\n    public class Foods {\r\n        @SerializedName(&quot;food_id&quot;)\r\n        @Expose\r\n        @PrimaryKey // ADDED as MUST have a primary key\r\n        @NonNull // ADDED Room does not accept NULLABLE PRIMARY KEY\r\n        private String foodId;\r\n        @SerializedName(&quot;food_name&quot;)\r\n        @Expose\r\n        private String foodName;\r\n        @SerializedName(&quot;food_image&quot;)\r\n        @Expose\r\n        private String foodImage;\r\n        @SerializedName(&quot;food_kcal&quot;)\r\n        @Expose\r\n        private String foodKcal;\r\n        @SerializedName(&quot;food_url&quot;)\r\n        @Expose\r\n        private String foodUrl;\r\n        @SerializedName(&quot;food_description&quot;)\r\n        @Expose\r\n        private String foodDescription;\r\n        @SerializedName(&quot;carb_percent&quot;)\r\n        @Expose\r\n        private String carbPercent;\r\n        @SerializedName(&quot;protein_percent&quot;)\r\n        @Expose\r\n        private String proteinPercent;\r\n        @SerializedName(&quot;fat_percent&quot;)\r\n        @Expose\r\n        private String fatPercent;\r\n        @SerializedName(&quot;units&quot;)\r\n        @Expose\r\n        @Ignore // ADDED AS going to be a table\r\n        private List&lt;FoodUnitsData&gt; units = null;\r\n    \r\n        @NonNull // ADDED (not reqd)\r\n        public String getFoodId() {\r\n            return foodId;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        public void setFoodId(@NonNull /* ADDED @NonNull (not reqd)*/ String foodId) {\r\n            this.foodId = foodId;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public String getFoodName() {\r\n            return foodName;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void setFoodName(String foodName) {\r\n            this.foodName = foodName;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public String getFoodImage() {\r\n            return foodImage;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void setFoodImage(String foodImage) {\r\n            this.foodImage = foodImage;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public String getFoodKcal() {\r\n            return foodKcal;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void setFoodKcal(String foodKcal) {\r\n            this.foodKcal = foodKcal;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public String getFoodUrl() {\r\n            return foodUrl;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void setFoodUrl(String foodUrl) {\r\n            this.foodUrl = foodUrl;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public String getFoodDescription() {\r\n            return foodDescription;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void setFoodDescription(String foodDescription) {\r\n            this.foodDescription = foodDescription;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public String getCarbPercent() {\r\n            return carbPercent;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void setCarbPercent(String carbPercent) {\r\n            this.carbPercent = carbPercent;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public String getProteinPercent() {\r\n            return proteinPercent;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void setProteinPercent(String proteinPercent) {\r\n            this.proteinPercent = proteinPercent;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public String getFatPercent() {\r\n            return fatPercent;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void setFatPercent(String fatPercent) {\r\n            this.fatPercent = fatPercent;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public List&lt;FoodUnitsData&gt; getUnits() {\r\n            return units;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void setUnits(List&lt;FoodUnitsData&gt; units) {\r\n            this.units = units;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n- The **Foods** class now has two uses:-\r\n\r\n1. as the class for extracting the JSON (where units will be populated with FoodUnitsData objects accordingly)\r\n1. as the model for the Room table.\r\n\r\n- See the comments\r\n\r\nSecond the **FoodUnitsDataEntity** class.\r\n\r\nThis is a new class that will be based upon the FoodUnitsData class but include two important values/columns not catered for by the FoodsUnitsData class, namely:-\r\n\r\n- a unique identifier that will be the primary key, and\r\n- a map/reference for establishing the relationship between a row and it&#39;s parent in the Foods table. As this column will be used quite frequently (i.e. it is essential for making the relationship) it makes sense to have an index on the column (speeds up making the relationship (like an index in a book would speed up finding stuff))\r\n- as there is a relationship, it is wise to ensure that referential integrity is maintained. That is you don&#39;t want orphaned units. As such a Foreign Key constraint is employed (a rule saying that the child must have a parent).\r\n- as it will be convenient to build/insert based upon a FoodUnitsData object then a constructor has been added that will create a FoodUnitsDataEnity object from a FoodUnitsData object (plus the all important Foods mapping/referencing/associating value).\r\n\r\nSo :-\r\n\r\n    /*\r\n        NEW CLASS that:-\r\n            Has a Unique ID (Long most efficient) as the primary Key\r\n            Has a column to reference/map to the parent FoodUnitsData of the food that owns this\r\n            Embeds the FoodUnitsData class\r\n            Enforces referential integrity be defining a Foreign Key constraint (optional)\r\n                If parent is delete then children are deleted (CASCADE)\r\n                If the parent&#39;s foodId column is changed then the foodIdMap is updated in the children (CASCADE)\r\n     */\r\n    @Entity(\r\n            tableName = &quot;food_units&quot;,\r\n            foreignKeys = {\r\n                    @ForeignKey(\r\n                            entity = Foods.class, /* The class (annotated with @ Entity) of the owner/parent */\r\n                            parentColumns = {&quot;foodId&quot;}, /* respective column referenced in the parent (Foods) */\r\n                            childColumns = {&quot;foodIdMap&quot;}, /* Column in the table that references the parent */\r\n                            onDelete = CASCADE, /* optional within Foreign key */\r\n                            onUpdate = CASCADE /* optional with foreign key */\r\n                    )\r\n            }\r\n    )\r\n    class FoodUnitsDataEntity {\r\n        @PrimaryKey\r\n        Long foodUnitId = null;\r\n        @ColumnInfo(index = true)\r\n        String foodIdMap;\r\n        @Embedded\r\n        FoodUnitsData foodUnitsData;\r\n    \r\n        FoodUnitsDataEntity(){}\r\n        FoodUnitsDataEntity(FoodUnitsData fud, String foodId) {\r\n            this.foodUnitsData = fud;\r\n            this.foodIdMap = foodId;\r\n            this.foodUnitId = null;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThird the **FoodUnitsData** class\r\n\r\nThis class is ok as it is. However, for the demo/example constructors were added as per :-\r\n\r\n    public class FoodUnitsData {\r\n        @SerializedName(&quot;unit&quot;)\r\n        @Expose\r\n        private String

However note that existing ones have been changed to not return void but instead long for inserts and int for updates deletes.\r\n- inserts return eithr -1 or the rowid (a hidden column that all tables (if using Room) will have that uniquely identifies the inserted row). So if it&#39;s -1 then row not inserted (or &lt; 0).\r\n- delete and updates return the number of affected (updated/deleted) rows.\r\n\r\nIt would be beneficial to be able to pass a Food object and insert all the units rows. As this requires a method with a body instead of an **interface** an **abstract class** will be used.\r\n\r\nSo DaoAccess becomes :-\r\n\r\n    @Dao\r\n    public /* CHANGED TO abstract class from interface */ abstract class DaoAccess {\r\n        @Query(&quot;SELECT * FROM food_data&quot;)\r\n        abstract List&lt;Foods&gt; getAll();\r\n    \r\n        @Insert(onConflict = OnConflictStrategy.IGNORE)\r\n        abstract long insert(Foods task);\r\n        @Insert(onConflict = OnConflictStrategy.IGNORE)\r\n        abstract long insert(FoodUnitsDataEntity foodUnitsDataEntity); \r\n    \r\n        @Delete\r\n        abstract int delete(Foods task);\r\n        @Delete\r\n        abstract int delete(FoodUnitsDataEntity foodUnitsDataEntity);\r\n    \r\n        @Update\r\n        abstract int update(Foods task);\r\n        @Update\r\n        abstract int update(FoodUnitsDataEntity foodUnitsDataEntity);\r\n    \r\n        @Query(&quot;&quot;) /* Trick Room to allow the use of @Transaction*/\r\n        @Transaction\r\n        long insertFoodsWithAllTheFoodUnitsDataEntityChildren(Foods foods) {\r\n            long rv = -1;\r\n            long fudInsertCount = 0;\r\n            if (insert(foods) &gt; 0) {\r\n              for(FoodUnitsData fud: foods.getUnits()) {\r\n                  if (insert(new FoodUnitsDataEntity(fud,foods.getFoodId())) &gt; 0) {\r\n                      fudInsertCount++;\r\n                  }\r\n              }\r\n              if (fudInsertCount != foods.getUnits().size()) {\r\n                  rv = -(foods.getUnits().size() - fudInsertCount);\r\n              } else {\r\n                  rv = 0;\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n            return rv;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFifth **FoodDatabase**\r\n\r\nJust add the **FoodUnitsDataEntity** as an entity :-\r\n\r\n    @Database(entities = {Foods.class, FoodUnitsDataEntity.class /*&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ADDED*/}, version = 1)\r\n    public abstract class FoodDatabase extends RoomDatabase {\r\n        public abstract DaoAccess daoAccess(); \r\n    }\r\n\r\nSixth testing the above in an Activity **MainActivity**\r\n\r\nThis activity will :-\r\n\r\n1. Build a Foods object with some embedded FoodUnitsData.\r\n2. Save it as a JSON string, extract it from the JSON string (logging \r\n the JSON string) \r\n3. get an instance of the database.\r\n4. get an instance of the DaoAccess.\r\n5. use the `insertFoodsWithAllTheFoodUnitsDataEntityChildren` method to insert the Foods and the assoctiated/related children.\r\n\r\nas per :-\r\n\r\n    public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\r\n    \r\n        FoodDatabase fooddb;\r\n        DaoAccess foodDao;\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\r\n    \r\n

do?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>TypeConverters</strong> are used to convert a type that room cannot handle to a type that it can (String, primitives, integer types such as Integer, Long, decimal types such as Double, Float).</p>\n<p><strong>@Embedded</strong> basically says include the member variables of the @Embedded class as columns. e.g. <code>@Embedded FoodUnitsData foodUnitsData;</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Test/Verify the Schema from the Room perspective</strong></p>\n<p>With the above class and with the entities defined in the class annotated with @Database (<strong>FoodDatabase</strong>) it would be a good idea to compile/build the project and fix anything that room complains about (none in this case).</p>\n<p>So have <strong>FoodDataabse</strong> to be :-</p>\n<pre><code>@Database(entities = {Foods.class, FoodUnitsDataEntity.class /*&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ADDED*/}, version = 1)\npublic abstract class FoodDatabase extends RoomDatabase {\n    public abstract DaoAccess daoAccess(); //* do not inlcude this line until the DaoAccess class has been created\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Note see comment re DaoAccess (i.e. comment out the line)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and then CTRL + F9 and check the build log</p>\n<p>Fourth <strong>DaoAccess</strong></p>\n<p>Obviously FoodUnitsDataEntity rows need to be added, update and deleted. It would also be very convenient if a Foods object could drive adding the FoodUnitsDataEntity rows all in one. This requires a method with a body therefore DaoAccess is changed from an interface to an abstract class to facilitate such a method.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Which one should we use?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You main issue is with the List of <strong>FoodUnitsData</strong></p>\n<p>Although you could convert the List and use a TypeConverter I would suggest not.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>you would probably convert to a JSON string <em>(so you extract from JSON into objects to then store the embedded objects as JSON)</em>. You BLOAT the data and also make using that data difficult.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Say for example you wanted to do a search for foods that have 1000 calories or more this would require a pretty complex query or you would load ALL the database and then loop through the foods and then the units.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would say that <code>@Embedded</code> is the method to use. Along with using <code>@Ignore</code> (the opposite i.e. exclude the member variable from being a column). i.e. you would @Ignore the List in the Foods class.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>With <code>@Embedded</code> you can then easily use individual values in queries.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You could then do something like <code>SELECT * FROM the_table_used_for_the_foodunitsdata WHERE calory &gt; 1000</code> and you would get a List of FoodUnitsData returned. SQLite will do this pretty efficiently.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Working Example</strong></p>\n<p>So putting the above into a working example:-</p>\n<p>First the <strong>Foods</strong> class and adding the @Ignore annotation :-</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity(tableName = &quot;food_data&quot;) // ADDED to make it usable as a Room table\npublic class Foods {\n    @SerializedName(&quot;food_id&quot;)\n    @Expose\n    @PrimaryKey // ADDED as MUST have a primary key\n    @NonNull // ADDED Room does not accept NULLABLE PRIMARY KEY\n    private String foodId;\n    @SerializedName(&quot;food_name&quot;)\n    @Expose\n    private String foodName;\n    @SerializedName(&quot;food_image&quot;)\n    @Expose\n    private String foodImage;\n    @SerializedName(&quot;food_kcal&quot;)\n    @Expose\n    private String foodKcal;\n    @SerializedName(&quot;food_url&quot;)\n    @Expose\n    private String foodUrl;\n    @SerializedName(&quot;food_description&quot;)\n    @Expose\n    private String foodDescription;\n    @SerializedName(&quot;carb_percent&quot;)\n    @Expose\n    private String carbPercent;\n    @SerializedName(&quot;protein_percent&quot;)\n    @Expose\n    private String proteinPercent;\n    @SerializedName(&quot;fat_percent&quot;)\n    @Expose\n    private String fatPercent;\n    @SerializedName(&quot;units&quot;)\n    @Expose\n    @Ignore // ADDED AS going to be a table\n    private List&lt;FoodUnitsData&gt; units = null;\n\n    @NonNull // ADDED (not reqd)\n    public String getFoodId() {\n        return foodId;\n    }\n\n\n    public void setFoodId(@NonNull /* ADDED @NonNull (not reqd)*/ String foodId) {\n        this.foodId = foodId;\n    }\n\n    public String getFoodName() {\n        return foodName;\n    }\n\n    public void setFoodName(String foodName) {\n        this.foodName = foodName;\n    }\n\n    public String getFoodImage() {\n        return foodImage;\n    }\n\n    public void setFoodImage(String foodImage) {\n        this.foodImage = foodImage;\n    }\n\n    public String getFoodKcal() {\n        return foodKcal;\n    }\n\n    public void setFoodKcal(String foodKcal) {\n        this.foodKcal = foodKcal;\n    }\n\n    public String getFoodUrl() {\n        return foodUrl;\n    }\n\n    public void setFoodUrl(String foodUrl) {\n        this.foodUrl = foodUrl;\n    }\n\n    public String getFoodDescription() {\n        return foodDescription;\n    }\n\n    public void setFoodDescription(String foodDescription) {\n        this.foodDescription = foodDescription;\n    }\n\n    public String getCarbPercent() {\n        return carbPercent;\n    }\n\n    public void setCarbPercent(String carbPercent) {\n        this.carbPercent = carbPercent;\n    }\n\n    public String getProteinPercent() {\n        return proteinPercent;\n    }\n\n    public void setProteinPercent(String proteinPercent) {\n        this.proteinPercent = proteinPercent;\n    }\n\n    public String getFatPercent() {\n        return fatPercent;\n    }\n\n    public void setFatPercent(String fatPercent) {\n        this.fatPercent = fatPercent;\n    }\n\n    public List&lt;FoodUnitsData&gt; getUnits() {\n        return units;\n    }\n\n    public void setUnits(List&lt;FoodUnitsData&gt; units) {\n        this.units = units;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Foods</strong> class now has two uses:-</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>as the class for extracting the JSON (where units will be populated with FoodUnitsData objects accordingly)</li>\n<li>as the model for the Room table.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>See the comments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Second the <strong>FoodUnitsDataEntity</strong> class.</p>\n<p>This is a new class that will be based upon the FoodUnitsData class but include two important values/columns not catered for by the FoodsUnitsData class, namely:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a unique identifier that will be the primary key, and</li>\n<li>a map/reference for establishing the relationship between a row and it's parent in the Foods table. As this column will be used quite frequently (i.e. it is essential for making the relationship) it makes sense to have an index on the column (speeds up making the relationship (like an index in a book would speed up finding stuff))</li>\n<li>as there is a relationship, it is wise to ensure that referential integrity is maintained. That is you don't want orphaned units. As such a Foreign Key constraint is employed (a rule saying that the child must have a parent).</li>\n<li>as it will be convenient to build/insert based upon a FoodUnitsData object then a constructor has been added that will create a FoodUnitsDataEnity object from a FoodUnitsData object (plus the all important Foods mapping/referencing/associating value).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So :-</p>\n<pre><code>/*\n    NEW CLASS that:-\n        Has a Unique ID (Long most efficient) as the primary Key\n        Has a column to reference/map to the parent FoodUnitsData of the food that owns this\n        Embeds the FoodUnitsData class\n        Enforces referential integrity be defining a Foreign Key constraint (optional)\n            If parent is delete then children are deleted (CASCADE)\n            If the parent's foodId column is changed then the foodIdMap is updated in the children (CASCADE)\n */\n@Entity(\n        tableName = &quot;food_units&quot;,\n        foreignKeys = {\n                @ForeignKey(\n                        entity = Foods.class, /* The class (annotated with @ Entity) of the owner/parent */\n                        parentColumns = {&quot;foodId&quot;}, /* respective column referenced in the parent (Foods) */\n                        childColumns = {&quot;foodIdMap&quot;}, /* Column in the table that references the parent */\n                        onDelete = CASCADE, /* optional within Foreign key */\n                        onUpdate = CASCADE /* optional with foreign key */\n                )\n        }\n)\nclass FoodUnitsDataEntity {\n    @PrimaryKey\n    Long foodUnitId = null;\n    @ColumnInfo(index = true)\n    String foodIdMap;\n    @Embedded\n    FoodUnitsData foodUnitsData;\n\n    FoodUnitsDataEntity(){}\n    FoodUnitsDataEntity(FoodUnitsData fud, String foodId) {\n        this.foodUnitsData = fud;\n        this.foodIdMap = foodId;\n        this.foodUnitId = null;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Third the <strong>FoodUnitsData</strong> class</p>\n<p>This class is ok as it is.

However note that existing ones have been changed to not return void but instead long for inserts and int for updates deletes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>inserts return eithr -1 or the rowid (a hidden column that all tables (if using Room) will have that uniquely identifies the inserted row). So if it's -1 then row not inserted (or &lt; 0).</li>\n<li>delete and updates return the number of affected (updated/deleted) rows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It would be beneficial to be able to pass a Food object and insert all the units rows. As this requires a method with a body instead of an <strong>interface</strong> an <strong>abstract class</strong> will be used.</p>\n<p>So DaoAccess becomes :-</p>\n<pre><code>@Dao\npublic /* CHANGED

If necessary, I can edit this question to include older versions of my program, which are not intended to expand.\r\n\r\nI will also accept tips to improve my program, including (but not limited to) time efficiency, (off topic however, as it is not the main question) and incorrect use of existing methods. (My paint() method)\r\n\r\n&gt; Problems: \r\n\r\n&gt; Examine Glider A in image 1. (Expected behavior) The whole point of the program was to make the cells shrink in the JFrame and add another row or column of dead cells to the `ArrayList&lt;ArrayList&lt;Boolean&gt;&gt; grid`. This glider, unfortunately does not cause this to happen. Instead, the result (Unexpected behavior) was that it simply &quot;flattened into a square&quot; as shown in image 2 (the square marked with an A).\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Examine Glider B in image 1. (Expected behavior) Seeing the results Glider A in image 1 made me think that glider B would end the same. However, this is not remotely true. Look at glider B in image 2. It, for some reason, does not even reach the border. (Unexpected)\r\n\r\nWhat this program is for and meant to do: Conway&#39;s game of life is on an infinite 2D plane, so I wanted to replicate this. My other programs used a fixed array size, but this used nested ArrayLists to expand, and truly be infinite (until the memory limit comes)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this expansion program simply fails to expand the border. (The border is actually smaller than it looks. Basically, (pretending my ArrayList&lt;ArrayList&lt;Boolean&gt;&gt; grid is an array) `grid[0][0 to grid.length-1]` inclusive, `grid[grid.length-1][0 to grid.length-1]` inclusive, and `grid[1 to grid.length-1][0]` inclusive, and `grid[1 to grid.length-1][grid.length-1]` inclusive.) Instead of doing the specified steps to make room, glider A in image 1 flattened against the border. (The border is beneath the grid of cells, where grey lines are not present)\r\n\r\nImage 1 [![enter image description here][1]][1] Image 2 [![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nThese images correspond with each other; glider A from image 1 Heading  produces the square in image 2, also \r\nmarked as A. If you see any words describing &quot;line 74,&quot; pointing toward &quot;line 74&quot; or words like &quot;UP&quot; (without any other meaning) in comments in the code please tell me, so I can remove them.

If necessary, I can edit this question to include older versions of my program, which are not intended to expand.</p>\n\n<p>I will also accept tips to improve my program, including (but not limited to) time efficiency, (off topic however, as it is not the main question) and incorrect use of existing methods. (My paint() method)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Problems: </p>\n  \n  <p>Examine Glider A in image 1. (Expected behavior) The whole point of the program was to make the cells shrink in the JFrame and add another row or column of dead cells to the <code>ArrayList&lt;ArrayList&lt;Boolean&gt;&gt; grid</code>. This glider, unfortunately does not cause this to happen. Instead, the result (Unexpected behavior) was that it simply \"flattened into a square\" as shown in image 2 (the square marked with an A).</p>\n  \n  <p>Examine Glider B in image 1. (Expected behavior) Seeing the results Glider A in image 1 made me think that glider B would end the same. However, this is not remotely true. Look at glider B in image 2. It, for some reason, does not even reach the border. (Unexpected)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What this program is for and meant to do: Conway's game of life is on an infinite 2D plane, so I wanted to replicate this. My other programs used a fixed array size, but this used nested ArrayLists to expand, and truly be infinite (until the memory limit comes)</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this expansion program simply fails to expand the border. (The border is actually smaller than it looks. Basically, (pretending my ArrayList> grid is an array) <code>grid[0][0 to grid.length-1]</code> inclusive, <code>grid[grid.length-1][0 to grid.length-1]</code> inclusive, and <code>grid[1 to grid.length-1][0]</code> inclusive, and <code>grid[1 to grid.length-1][grid.length-1]</code> inclusive.) Instead of doing the specified steps to make room, glider A in image 1 flattened against the border. (The border is beneath the grid of cells, where grey lines are not present)</p>\n\n<p>Image 1 <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BW36J.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BW36J.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a> Image 2 <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cqEor.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cqEor.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>These images correspond with each other; glider A from image 1 Heading  produces the square in image 2, also \nmarked as A. If you see any words describing \"line 74,\" pointing toward \"line 74\" or words like \"UP\" (without any other meaning) in comments in the code please tell me, so I can remove them.

This creation of a JFrame takes place inside a public class called ColorChanger where javax.swing.JFrame is imported.</p>\n\n<p>ColorChanger Class (at the bottom of main under user prompts for colors):</p>\n\n<pre><code>JFrame application = new JFrame();\napplication.setLocation(250, 250);\napplication.setSize(400, 150);\napplication.setTitle(\"Color Changer\");\napplication.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\napplication.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\nColorPanel panel = new ColorPanel(colorAmountRed, colorAmountGreen, colorAmountBlue);\napplication.add(panel);\n\napplication.setVisible(true);\nSystem.out.println(\"The GUI has closed.\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The constructor for panel is located inside a class called ColorPanel:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import javax.swing.JPanel;\nimport java.awt.Color;\nimport java.awt.Font;\nimport java.awt.Graphics;\n\npublic class ColorPanel extends JPanel {\n    private int red;    \n    private int green;\n    private int blue;\n\n    public ColorPanel(int red, int green, int blue) {\n        this.red = red;\n        this.green = green;\n        this.blue = blue;\n        this.setBackground(new Color (this.red, this.green, this.blue));    \n    }\n\n    public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {\n        super.paintComponent(g);    // Calls parent paintComponent (JPanel itself)\n\n        int fontSize = 26;  // Font Size sent as a parameter\n        g.setFont(new Font(\"TimesRoman\", Font.PLAIN, fontSize));\n\n        int redContrast = 0;\n        if (red &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; red &lt;= 123) {\n            redContrast = 255;\n        }\n\n        int greenContrast = 0;\n        if (green &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; green &lt;= 123) {\n            greenContrast = 255;\n        }\n\n        int blueContrast = 0;\n        if (blue &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; blue &lt;= 123) {\n            blueContrast = 255;\n        }\n        this.setForeground(new Color (redContrast, greenContrast, blueContrast));\n        g.drawString(\"Java GUI One\", getWidth() / 2 - 75, getHeight() / 2 + 10 );\n\n    }\n}   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm fairly certain that a println is the way to go, but I'm unsure of where it needs to go in order to appear AFTER the GUI is closed. This is my first time ever working with Java (or StackOverflow, for that matter). Apologies for any formatting issues, etc.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","html","swing","jframe","integration"],"owner":{"account_id":10571870,"reputation":308,"user_id":12181868,"display_name":"Muhammad Afzaal"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":255,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1642883727,"creation_date":1583569372,"question_id":60575704,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m developing a Google map application in Java Swing using the NetBeans framework.

When your code execution reaches the `if()`, it executes the\r\n    `rs.next()`.\r\n 2. Depending on the result of your query, the ResultSet object `rs`\r\n    either has zero or more results.\r\n 3. The `rs` object maintains a pointer to all the records it contains.\r\n    Initially, this pointer points to a sort of &quot;dummy&quot; location before\r\n    the actual record.\r\n 4. E.g. if there are three records in the `rs` object, say [0,1,2],\r\n    then initially the pointer points to -1.\r\n 5. Every time you call `next()` on `rs`, the pointer is moved one place\r\n    forward and if there is a record present on the new location,\r\n    `next()` returns `true`.\r\n 6. If there is no record present on the new location, `next()` returns\r\n    `false`.\r\n 7. For the sake of your question, assume that there is a record\r\n    available, and `rs.next()` returns `true`.\r\n 8. Hence, the execution enters inside the `if()` body.\r\n 9. `rs.next()` is usually called inside a loop if more than one record\r\n    is expected from a select query, but since there&#39;s no loop in your\r\n    code, `rs.next()` executes only once. That&#39;s it, there isn&#39;t\r\n    anything else happening with it. On to the `if()` body then.\r\n 10. Here, the compiler executes the code that you have written i.e. setting the\r\n    `nameTextField`&#39;s text to `null` and showing a pop-up with your\r\n    error message.\r\n 11. Then, the compiler waits for the error dialog to be closed (I\r\n     think, not sure about this step as it&#39;s been too long, but go look at the javadocs to see whether `JOptionPane.showMessageDialog()` is non-blocking or blocking).\r\n 12. But the code execution doesn&#39;t stop here, and this is where things seem\r\n     to get fishy in your code.\r\n 13. In the code you have provided with this question, you do not have any `return` or `throw` or `break` before your `if()` body ends.\r\n 14.

Right now, I'm implementing the previous month, and when I click on the button, the previous month does show up, however it show up behind the current month, instead of replacing it like you would think.
