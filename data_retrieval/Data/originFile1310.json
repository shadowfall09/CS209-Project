You have an object that has a size of &quot;1.0 x 1.0&quot; in your world coordinate system (regardless of which *unit* this has). And this object should be painted so that it has a size of, for example, &quot;600 pixels * 600 pixels&quot; on the screen. \r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, there are at least three options to achieve this in Swing:\r\n\r\n - You can draw into an image, and then draw a scaled version of the image\r\n - You can draw into a scaled `Graphics2D` object\r\n - You can draw scaled objects\r\n\r\nEach of this has possible advantages and disadvantages, and hidden caveats.\r\n\r\n## Drawing into an image, and drawing a scaled version of the image: ##\r\n\r\nThis might look like a simple solution, but has a potential drawback: The image itself has a certain resolution (size). If the image is too small, and you are scaling it up to fill the screen, it may appear blocky. If the image is too large, and you are scaling it down to fit into the screen, pixels of the image may be lost.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, there are several tuning parameters for the process of scaling the image. In fact, scaling an image is far more tricky than it looks at the first glance. For details, one may refer to the article [The Perils of Image.getScaledInstance()][1] by Chris Campbell.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Drawing into a scaled `Graphics2D` object ##\r\n\r\nThe [`Graphics2D` class][2] already offers the full functionality that is necessary to create the transformation between the *world coordinate system* and the *screen coordinate system*. This is accomplished by the `Graphics2D` class by internally storing an [`AffineTransform`][3], which describes this transformation. This `AffineTransform` may be modified directly via the `Graphics2D` object:\r\n\r\n    void paintSomething(Graphics2D g) {\r\n        ...\r\n        g.draw(someShape);\r\n\r\n        // Everything that is painted after this line will\r\n        // be painted 3 times as large: \r\n        g.scale(3.0, 3.0);\r\n\r\n        g.draw(someShape); // Will be drawn larger \r\n    }\r\n\r\nSome care has to be taken to properly manage the transform that is stored in the `Graphics2D` object. In general, one should create a backup of the original `AffineTransform` before applying additional transformations, and restore this original transform afterwards:\r\n\r\n    // Create a backup of the original transform\r\n    AffineTransform oldAT = g.getTransform();\r\n\r\n    // Apply some transformations\r\n    g.scale(3.0, 4.0);\r\n    g.translate(10.0, 20.0);\r\n \r\n    // Do custom painting the the transformed graphics\r\n    paintSomething(g):\r\n\r\n    // Restore the original transformation\r\n    g.setTransform(oldAT);\r\n\r\n(Another advice for the last method: The [`Graphics2D#setTransform`][4] method should  **never** be used to apply a new coordinate transform on top of an existing transform. It is solely intended for restoring an &quot;old&quot; transform, as shown in this example (and in the documentation of this method)).\r\n\r\nOne potential drawback of scaling with the `Graphics2D` class is that afterwards, **everything** will be scaled. Particularly, this scaling will **also** affect line widths (that is, the width of the [Stroke][5]). For example, consider a sequence of calls like this one:\r\n\r\n    // By default, this will paint a line with a width (stroke) of 1.0:\r\n    g.draw(someLine);\r\n\r\n    // Apply some scaling...\r\n    g.scale(10.0, 10.0);\r\n\r\n    // Now, this will paint the same line, but with a width of 10. \r\n    g.draw(someLine);\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second call will cause a line to be drawn that is 10 pixels wide. This may not be desired in many cases. This effect can be avoided with the third alternative:\r\n\r\n\r\n## Drawing scaled objects ##\r\n\r\nThe transformation between the *world coordinate system* and the *screen coordinate system* can also be maintained manually. It is convenient to represent this as an [`AffineTransform`][6]. The `AffineTransform` class can be used to create transformed versions of `Shape` object, that can then be drawn directly into an (**un**-transformed) `Graphics2D` object. This is accomplished with the [`AffineTransform#createTransformedShape`][7] method:\r\n\r\n\r\n    void paintSomething(Graphics2D g) {\r\n        ...\r\n        // Draw some shape in its normal size\r\n        g.draw(someShape);\r\n\r\n        // Create a scaling transform\r\n        AffineTransform at = AffineTransform.getScaleInstance(3.0, 3.0);\r\n\r\n        // Create a scaled version of the shape\r\n        Shape transformedShape = at.createTransformedShape(someShape);\r\n\r\n        // Draw the scaled shape\r\n        g.draw(transformedShape);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is probably the most versatile approach. The only potential drawback is that, when *many* small, simple shapes are drawn, this will cause many, small temporary transformed shapes to be created, which may cause reduced performance. (There are ways to alleviate this problem, but detailed performance considerations and optimizations are beyond the scope of this answer). \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Summary ##\r\n\r\nThe follwing image shows the comparison of all approaches. Some example objects (represented as `Shape` objects) are drawn. Each row compares the three different scaling methods mentioned above. With their &quot;default&quot; size, the objects fill a rectangle in world coordinates that has a size of 100x100. In the first two rows, they are scaled up to fill an area on the screen of 190x190 pixels. In the last two rows, they are scaled down to fill an area on the screen of 60x60 pixels. (These sizes have been chosen in order to have some &quot;odd&quot; scaling factors of 1.9 and 0.6. Certain effects (artifacts) may not appear when the scaling factors are whole numbers, or exactly 0.5, for example). \r\n\r\nFor the upscaling and the downscaling, there additionally is a comparison between the &quot;standard&quot; way of painting, and &quot;high quality&quot; painting (indicated by the &quot;(HQ)&quot; in the title of each panel). The &quot;high quality&quot; here simply means that the rendering hints\r\n\r\n    KEY_ANTIALIAS = VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON\r\n    KEY_RENDERING = VALUE_RENDER_QUALITY\r\n\r\nhave been set:\r\n\r\n![ScalingMethods][8]\r\n\r\nHere is the corresponding program, as an [MCVE][9]:\r\n\r\n    import java.awt.Color;\r\n    import java.awt.Dimension;\r\n    import java.awt.Graphics;\r\n    import java.awt.Graphics2D;\r\n    import java.awt.GridLayout;\r\n    import java.awt.RenderingHints;\r\n    import java.awt.Shape;\r\n    import java.awt.geom.AffineTransform;\r\n    import java.awt.geom.Ellipse2D;\r\n    import java.awt.geom.Line2D;\r\n    import java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D;\r\n    import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;\r\n    import java.util.ArrayList;\r\n    import java.util.List;\r\n    \r\n    import javax.swing.BorderFactory;\r\n    import javax.swing.JFrame;\r\n    import javax.swing.JPanel;\r\n    import javax.swing.SwingUtilities;\r\n    \r\n    public class ScalingMethodComparison\r\n    {\r\n        public static void main(String[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable()\r\n            {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public void run()\r\n                {\r\n                    createAndShowGUI();\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n        private static void createAndShowGUI()\r\n        {\r\n            JFrame f = new JFrame();\r\n            f.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\r\n            f.getContentPane().setLayout(new GridLayout(0,1));\r\n            \r\n            Dimension larger = new Dimension(190,190);\r\n            Dimension smaller = new Dimension(60,60);\r\n    \r\n            f.getContentPane().add(createPanel(larger, false));\r\n            f.getContentPane().add(createPanel(larger, true));\r\n            f.getContentPane().add(createPanel(smaller, false));\r\n            f.getContentPane().add(createPanel(smaller, true));\r\n            \r\n            f.pack();\r\n            f.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\r\n            f.setVisible(true);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        private static JPanel createPanel(Dimension d, boolean highQuality)\r\n        {\r\n            JPanel p = new JPanel(new GridLayout(1,3));\r\n            for (ScalingMethodComparisonPanel.ScalingMethod scalingMethod : \r\n                ScalingMethodComparisonPanel.ScalingMethod.values())\r\n            {\r\n                p.add(createPanel(d, scalingMethod, highQuality));\r\n            }\r\n            return p;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        private static JPanel createPanel(\r\n            Dimension d, ScalingMethodComparisonPanel.ScalingMethod scalingMethod, \r\n            boolean highQuality)\r\n        {\r\n            JPanel p = new JPanel(new GridLayout(1,1));\r\n            p.setBorder(BorderFactory.createTitledBorder(\r\n                scalingMethod.toString()+(highQuality?&quot;

You have an object that has a size of \"1.0 x 1.0\" in your world coordinate system (regardless of which <em>unit</em> this has). And this object should be painted so that it has a size of, for example, \"600 pixels * 600 pixels\" on the screen. </p>\n\n<p>Broadly speaking, there are at least three options to achieve this in Swing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You can draw into an image, and then draw a scaled version of the image</li>\n<li>You can draw into a scaled <code>Graphics2D</code> object</li>\n<li>You can draw scaled objects</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each of this has possible advantages and disadvantages, and hidden caveats.</p>\n\n<h2>Drawing into an image, and drawing a scaled version of the image:</h2>\n\n<p>This might look like a simple solution, but has a potential drawback: The image itself has a certain resolution (size). If the image is too small, and you are scaling it up to fill the screen, it may appear blocky. If the image is too large, and you are scaling it down to fit into the screen, pixels of the image may be lost.</p>\n\n<p>In both cases, there are several tuning parameters for the process of scaling the image. In fact, scaling an image is far more tricky than it looks at the first glance. For details, one may refer to the article <a href=\"https://community.oracle.com/docs/DOC-983611\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Perils of Image.getScaledInstance()</a> by Chris Campbell.</p>\n\n<h2>Drawing into a scaled <code>Graphics2D</code> object</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics2D.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>Graphics2D</code> class</a> already offers the full functionality that is necessary to create the transformation between the <em>world coordinate system</em> and the <em>screen coordinate system</em>. This is accomplished by the <code>Graphics2D</code> class by internally storing an <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/geom/AffineTransform.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>AffineTransform</code></a>, which describes this transformation. This <code>AffineTransform</code> may be modified directly via the <code>Graphics2D</code> object:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void paintSomething(Graphics2D g) {\n    ...\n    g.draw(someShape);\n\n    // Everything that is painted after this line will\n    // be painted 3 times as large: \n    g.scale(3.0, 3.0);\n\n    g.draw(someShape); // Will be drawn larger \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Some care has to be taken to properly manage the transform that is stored in the <code>Graphics2D</code> object. In general, one should create a backup of the original <code>AffineTransform</code> before applying additional transformations, and restore this original transform afterwards:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Create a backup of the original transform\nAffineTransform oldAT = g.getTransform();\n\n// Apply some transformations\ng.scale(3.0, 4.0);\ng.translate(10.0, 20.0);\n\n// Do custom painting the the transformed graphics\npaintSomething(g):\n\n// Restore the original transformation\ng.setTransform(oldAT);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Another advice for the last method: The <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics2D.html#setTransform-java.awt.geom.AffineTransform-\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>Graphics2D#setTransform</code></a> method should  <strong>never</strong> be used to apply a new coordinate transform on top of an existing transform. It is solely intended for restoring an \"old\" transform, as shown in this example (and in the documentation of this method)).</p>\n\n<p>One potential drawback of scaling with the <code>Graphics2D</code> class is that afterwards, <strong>everything</strong> will be scaled. Particularly, this scaling will <strong>also</strong> affect line widths (that is, the width of the <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Stroke.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Stroke</a>). For example, consider a sequence of calls like this one:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// By default, this will paint a line with a width (stroke) of 1.0:\ng.draw(someLine);\n\n// Apply some scaling...\ng.scale(10.0, 10.0);\n\n// Now, this will paint the same line, but with a width of 10. \ng.draw(someLine);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The second call will cause a line to be drawn that is 10 pixels wide. This may not be desired in many cases. This effect can be avoided with the third alternative:</p>\n\n<h2>Drawing scaled objects</h2>\n\n<p>The transformation between the <em>world coordinate system</em> and the <em>screen coordinate system</em> can also be maintained manually. It is convenient to represent this as an <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/geom/AffineTransform.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>AffineTransform</code></a>. The <code>AffineTransform</code> class can be used to create transformed versions of <code>Shape</code> object, that can then be drawn directly into an (<strong>un</strong>-transformed) <code>Graphics2D</code> object. This is accomplished with the <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/geom/AffineTransform.html#createTransformedShape-java.awt.Shape-\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>AffineTransform#createTransformedShape</code></a> method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void paintSomething(Graphics2D g) {\n    ...\n    // Draw some shape in its normal size\n    g.draw(someShape);\n\n    // Create a scaling transform\n    AffineTransform at = AffineTransform.getScaleInstance(3.0, 3.0);\n\n    // Create a scaled version of the shape\n    Shape transformedShape = at.createTransformedShape(someShape);\n\n    // Draw the scaled shape\n    g.draw(transformedShape);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is probably the most versatile approach. The only potential drawback is that, when <em>many</em> small, simple shapes are drawn, this will cause many, small temporary transformed shapes to be created, which may cause reduced performance. (There are ways to alleviate this problem, but detailed performance considerations and optimizations are beyond the scope of this answer). </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n\n<p>The follwing image shows the comparison of all approaches. Some example objects (represented as <code>Shape</code> objects) are drawn. Each row compares the three different scaling methods mentioned above. With their \"default\" size, the objects fill a rectangle in world coordinates that has a size of 100x100. In the first two rows, they are scaled up to fill an area on the screen of 190x190 pixels. In the last two rows, they are scaled down to fill an area on the screen of 60x60 pixels. (These sizes have been chosen in order to have some \"odd\" scaling factors of 1.9 and 0.6. Certain effects (artifacts) may not appear when the scaling factors are whole numbers, or exactly 0.5, for example). </p>\n\n<p>For the upscaling and the downscaling, there additionally is a comparison between the \"standard\" way of painting, and \"high quality\" painting (indicated by the \"(HQ)\" in the title of each panel). The \"high quality\" here simply means that the rendering hints</p>\n\n<pre><code>KEY_ANTIALIAS = VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON\nKEY_RENDERING = VALUE_RENDER_QUALITY\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>have been set:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Jl2o.png\" alt=\"ScalingMethods\"></p>\n\n<p>Here is the corresponding program, as an <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\">MCVE</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.awt.Color;\nimport java.awt.Dimension;\nimport java.awt.Graphics;\nimport java.awt.Graphics2D;\nimport java.awt.GridLayout;\nimport java.awt.RenderingHints;\nimport java.awt.Shape;\nimport java.awt.geom.AffineTransform;\nimport java.awt.geom.Ellipse2D;\nimport java.awt.geom.Line2D;\nimport java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D;\nimport java.awt.image.BufferedImage;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\nimport javax.swing.BorderFactory;\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\nimport javax.swing.JPanel;\nimport javax.swing.SwingUtilities;\n\npublic class ScalingMethodComparison\n{\n    public static void main(String[] args)\n    {\n        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable()\n        {\n            @Override\n            public void run()\n            {\n                createAndShowGUI();\n            }\n        });\n    }\n    private static void createAndShowGUI()\n    {\n        JFrame f = new JFrame();\n        f.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n        f.getContentPane().setLayout(new GridLayout(0,1));\n\n        Dimension larger = new Dimension(190,190);\n        Dimension smaller = new Dimension(60,60);\n\n        f.getContentPane().add(createPanel(larger, false));\n        f.getContentPane().add(createPanel(larger, true));\n        f.getContentPane().add(createPanel(smaller, false));\n        f.getContentPane().add(createPanel(smaller, true));\n\n        f.pack();\n        f.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\n        f.setVisible(true);\n    }\n\n    private static JPanel createPanel(Dimension d, boolean highQuality)\n    {\n        JPanel p = new JPanel(new GridLayout(1,3));\n        for (ScalingMethodComparisonPanel.ScalingMethod scalingMethod : \n            ScalingMethodComparisonPanel.ScalingMethod.values())\n        {\n            p.add(createPanel(d, scalingMethod, highQuality));\n        }\n        return p;\n    }\n\n    private static JPanel createPanel(\n        Dimension d, ScalingMethodComparisonPanel.ScalingMethod scalingMethod, \n        boolean highQuality)\n    {\n        JPanel p = new JPanel(new GridLayout(1,1));\n        p.setBorder(BorderFactory.createTitledBorder(\n            scalingMethod.toString()+(highQuality?\" (HQ)\":\"\")));\n        JPanel scalingMethodComparisonPanel = \n            new ScalingMethodComparisonPanel(\n                createObjects(), d, scalingMethod, highQuality);\n        p.add(scalingMethodComparisonPanel);\n        return p;\n    }\n\n    // Returns a list of objects that should be drawn, \n    // occupying a rectangle of 100x100 in WORLD COORDINATES\n    private static List&lt;Shape&gt;

A Team object carries a series of objects, and the program displays all of the values it needs to when the TextFieldTableCells are not added.

The problem lies when both are combined together, which causes many errors, which happen when the JavaFX class containing the table is initialized.

You might consider using the [`MediaPlayer.OnCompletionListener`][1] for listening if your sound has stopped playing and then add the next item to the `RecyclerView` and then call `notifyDataSetChanged` on your adapter to load the next item in your `RecyclerView`. \r\n\r\nHence you might want the following modification in your adapter first. \r\n\r\n    // Declare a function in your adapter which adds new item in the RecyclerView\r\n    public void addItem(Multiples item) {\r\n        items.add(item);\r\n        notifyItemInserted(items.size());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow in your `Activity` where you set up the `RecyclerView`, you need to have the following arrays. \r\n\r\n    ArrayList&lt;Multiples&gt; allItems = new ArrayList&lt;Multiples&gt;(); // This list will contain all the data\r\n    int soundToBePlayed = -1; // Initialize the value with -1\r\n    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; soundList = getAllSoundsInAList(); \r\n\r\nModify your functions as follows. \r\n\r\n    private void initComponent() {\r\n        recyclerView = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.recyclerView);\r\n        recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(this));\r\n        recyclerView.setHasFixedSize(true);\r\n        allItems = DataGenerator.getPeopleData(this,of,value);\r\n        setAdapter();\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    private void setAdapter() {\r\n        mAdapter = new AdapterListAnimation(this, animation_type); // Do not pass the items list\r\n        recyclerView.setAdapter(mAdapter);\r\n    \r\n        // ..

Just remove the variable which takes the `items`. Because we will be adding elements to the `items` later. \r\n\r\nThen you need to write another function which needs to be called in your `onCreate` function of your activity after your call your `initComponent` function. The function should look like the following. \r\n\r\n    private void addItemInRecyclerViewAndPlaySound() {\r\n    \r\n        soundToBePlayed++;\r\n    \r\n        adapter.addItem(allItems.get(soundToBePlayed));\r\n        recyclerView.scrollToPosition(adapter.getItemCount() - 1);\r\n    \r\n        Integer soundId = soundList.get(soundToBePlayed);\r\n    \r\n        MediaPlayer mp = MediaPlayer.create(this, soundId);\r\n    \r\n        if (mp.isPlaying()) {\r\n            mp.stop();\r\n            mp.release();\r\n            mp = MediaPlayer.create(this, soundId);\r\n            mp.setOnCompletionListener(new MediaPlayer.OnCompletionListener() {\r\n                public void onCompletion(MediaPlayer mp) {\r\n                    // Call this function again to add next item\r\n                    // and play the next sound at the same time\r\n                    if(soundToBePlayed &lt; allItems.size() - 1)\r\n                        addItemInRecyclerViewAndPlaySound();\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        mp.start();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI have not tested the code, however, I think you get the idea already. This can be implemented gracefully using a `interface` inside the adapter as well.

The function should look like the following. </p>\n\n<pre><code>private void addItemInRecyclerViewAndPlaySound() {\n\n    soundToBePlayed++;\n\n    adapter.addItem(allItems.get(soundToBePlayed));\n    recyclerView.scrollToPosition(adapter.getItemCount() - 1);\n\n    Integer soundId = soundList.get(soundToBePlayed);\n\n    MediaPlayer mp = MediaPlayer.create(this, soundId);\n\n    if (mp.isPlaying()) {\n        mp.stop();\n        mp.release();\n        mp = MediaPlayer.create(this, soundId);\n        mp.setOnCompletionListener(new MediaPlayer.OnCompletionListener() {\n            public void onCompletion(MediaPlayer mp) {\n                // Call this function again to add next item\n                // and play the next sound at the same time\n                if(soundToBePlayed &lt; allItems.size() - 1)\n                    addItemInRecyclerViewAndPlaySound();\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    mp.start();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have not tested the code, however, I think you get the idea already. This can be implemented gracefully using a <code>interface</code> inside the adapter as well. The imeplemntation technique is your choice. </p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":5439000,"reputation":131,"user_id":4327564,"display_name":"saeid aslami"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":7,"is_accepted":false,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1565509387,"creation_date":1565509387,"answer_id":57448206,"question_id":55443865,"body_markdown":"you need to override `onViewAttachedToWindow` and `onViewDetachedFromWindow`. but for detecting holer type you need `getItemViewType()` just like that:\r\n \r\n    public class PostAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter {\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int getItemViewType(int position) {\r\n        switch (types.get(position)){\r\n            case 1:\r\n                return 1;\r\n            case 2:\r\n                return 2;\r\n            default:\r\n                return position;\r\n\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onViewAttachedToWindow(@NonNull RecyclerView.ViewHolder holder) {\r\n        super.onViewAttachedToWindow(holder);\r\n        if (holder.getItemViewType() == 1){\r\n            //play song\r\n           \r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onViewDetachedFromWindow(@NonNull RecyclerView.ViewHolder holder) {\r\n        super.onViewDetachedFromWindow(holder);\r\n        if (holder.getItemViewType() == 1){\r\n            //pause song\r\n          \r\n        }\r\n    }","title":"How to detect each RecyclerView item after it is displayed","body":"<p>you need to override <code>onViewAttachedToWindow</code> and <code>onViewDetachedFromWindow</code>. but for detecting holer type you need <code>getItemViewType()</code> just like that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class PostAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter {\n\n@Override\npublic int getItemViewType(int position) {\n    switch (types.get(position)){\n        case 1:\n            return 1;\n        case 2:\n            return 2;\n        default:\n            return position;\n\n\n    }\n}\n@Override\npublic void onViewAttachedToWindow(@NonNull RecyclerView.ViewHolder holder) {\n    super.onViewAttachedToWindow(holder);\n    if (holder.getItemViewType() == 1){\n        //play song\n\n    }\n\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void onViewDetachedFromWindow(@NonNull RecyclerView.ViewHolder holder) {\n    super.onViewDetachedFromWindow(holder);\n    if (holder.getItemViewType() == 1){\n        //pause song\n\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1322892,"reputation":2106,"user_id":1684778,"accept_rate":83,"display_name":"Dan"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":14551,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":13,"accepted_answer_id":55600054,"answer_count":4,"score":11,"last_activity_date":1653664352,"creation_date":1554055467,"question_id":55443865,"body_markdown":"I want to detect each item in my [RecylerView][1] after it is displayed to the user.\r\n\r\nBasically, I am trying to play a sound on each item after it is loaded on the screen. \r\n\r\nBut I am not able to detect whenever each item is loaded on the screen!

I have a class called &quot;Circuitware&quot; and every object extends this as follows</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public Circuitware implements connectable {\n\n    protected int x;\n    protected int y;\n    protected int allowedConnetions;\n    protected Ciruitware[] connections;\n    private int totalConnections;\n\n    public Circuitware(int x, int y, int allowedConnections, Circuitware[] connections) {\n        this.x = x;\n        this.y = y;\n        this.allowedConnections = allowedConnections;\n        this.connections = new Array[allowedConnections];\n        for (Object O: connections) {\n            if (O != null) {\n                this.totalConnections += 1;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public int getX() {\n        return this.x;\n    }\n    \n    public int getY() {\n        return this.y;\n    }\n    \n    public void setX(int x) {\n        this.x = x;\n    }\n    \n    public void setY(int y) {\n        this.y = y;\n    }\n    \n    public&lt;T&gt; void addConnection(T connection) {\n        if (this.totalConnections&lt;this.allowedConnections) {\n            this.connections.add(connection);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now an example of a subclass is</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class LogicGate extends Circuitware {\n\n    String type;\n\n    public LogicGate(int x, int y, int allowedConnections, Circuitware[] connections, String type) {\n        super(x, y, allowedConnections, connections);\n        this.type = type;\n    }\n\n    public boolean output() {\n        //Depending on the gate and input we output things\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now the thing is that the number of allowed connections depends on the type of the circuit, for example logic gates in my game can have 1 connection if it is an NOT gate, 2 connections if it is an AND, XOR, NOR gates or 3 connections if it is and extended OR, extended AND gates, where are switches can only have 0. Is there are better way of doing this?</p>\n<p>I also need help understanding that if I have an array of type Circuitware can I add objects from its subclasses? Because the output of logic gates and inputs of other logic gates while they can be inputs to clocks.</p>\n<p>Would it be better, design-wise, if I got rid of the &quot;Circuitware&quot; class altogether? But then wouldn't that make connections between different classes harder?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","maven","intellij-idea","jar","path"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":401843,"reputation":89788,"user_id":768644,"display_name":"rzwitserloot"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1653661153,"creation_date":1653661153,"answer_id":72406850,"question_id":72406596,"body_markdown":"&gt; I&#39;ve been trying to make jar application that can read a csv file in the same directory as it.\r\n\r\nAh, there&#39;s your problem. That just isn&#39;t a thing.\r\n\r\nThere are only 2 types of files:\r\n\r\n### Application Resources\r\n\r\nThese are __read only__, and are as much part of your app as your class files are. It is not in any way relevant to think about &#39;editing&#39; them - that&#39;s not the kind of thing they are. It is reasonable to assume that if this resource is somehow missing, the app is as corrupt / misinstalled as it would be if class files are missing.\r\n\r\nFor __this__, you use `.getResource` and `.getResourceAsStream`. And note that `getClass().getClassLoader()` is wrong, you want `MyClass.class.getResource` and then add a slash if you want to go from root (because `getClass()` potentially breaks when you subclass, and going via classloader is [A] just typing for no reason, and [B] breaks in bootload scenarios. `MyOwnClassName.class.getResource` never breaks, so, always use that).\r\n\r\nThis asks java to look in the same place class files are __and nowhere else__. Your class files are __inside__ the jar files, and not __next to them__, therefore, it won&#39;t find a text file that is sitting next to jar files.\r\n\r\n__it does not make sense__ that it does work during development: That means you shoved a file inside the resources folder, which is equivalent to having a CSV file __inside__ the jar file. You must have gone out of your way to tell your build system to do weird things. Don&#39;t do that.\r\n\r\nIf that CSV file is not intended to be user editable it should be inside the jar file and not next to it: That makes it an application resource. Examples of application resources:\r\n\r\n* You have a GUI, and you need to store the icon files and splash screen art and such someplace.\r\n* You ship static data with your app, such as a table of all US states along with the zipcodes they use (could be a text or csv file for example).\r\n* __Templates__ of config files. Not config files themselves.\r\n* DLLs and the like that you need to unpack (because windows/linux/mac isn&#39;t going to look inside jars for them).\r\n* You&#39;re a webapp and you want to ship the HTML static files along with your webapp.\r\n\r\nIf this is what your CSV file is, the fix is to put it in the jar, not next to it, then load it with `MyClass.class.getResource(name)`.\r\n\r\n## Config files and project files\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n* For a rich text editor (like, say, LibreOffice Writer), the `.odt` files representing your writings.\r\n* Save games for a game.\r\n* A config file, which can be edited by the user, or is edited by your own app in a &#39;preferences&#39; dialog. This stores for example whether to open the app full screen or not, or authentication info for a third party API you&#39;re using.\r\n\r\n__These should not be in the jar, should not be loaded with `.getResource` at all, and should not be in src/main/resources in the first place__.\r\n\r\nThey also should not be next to your jar! That&#39;s an outdated and insecure model (the idea that editable files sit in the same place the app itself sits): A proper OS configuration means that an app cannot write to itself which is most easily accomplished by having it be incapable of writing to its directory. Some OSes (notably, windows) did this wrong for a while.\r\n\r\nFor example on windows, your app lives in `C:\\Program Files\\MakorisAwesomeApp\\makori.jar`, and the data files for it live somewhere in `C:\\Users\\UserThatInstalledIt\\Documents\\MakorisAwesomeApp`.\r\n\r\noh linux, your app might be `/usr/bin/makori` and the data lives somewhere in the home dir. Config data might live in `/etc/`.\r\n\r\nYou don&#39;t &quot;ship&quot; your config files, you instead make installers that create them. You can do this part in-app by detecting that the relevant config file does not exist, load in a template (that __is__ a resource, shipped inside your jar, loaded with `getResource`), and write it out, and tell the user to go look at it and edit it.\r\n\r\n## I really want a CSV file next to my jars!\r\n\r\nWell, that&#39;s wrong, so, there are no libraries that make this easy. When you want to do silly things its good that APIs don&#39;t make that easy, right?\r\n\r\nThere are really hacky ways to do this. You can use .getResource to get a URL and then &#39;parse&#39; this. This breaks the classloader abstraction concept (because in java, you can write your own classloaders and they can load from anywhere, not just files or entries in jars), but you can ask for &#39;yourself&#39; (`MyClass.class.getResource(&quot;MyClass.class&quot;)`), pull the URL apart and figure out what&#39;s happening - does it start with `file://`? Then it is a file, so turn it into a `j.i.File` object, and go from there. Does it start with `jar://`? find the `!`, substring out the jar part, and now you know the jar. Make that a `java.io.File`, ask for the parent dir, and look there for the CSV.\r\n\r\nYou have to write all this. It&#39;s complicated code that is hard to test.

If you find at least one that makes no sense - you now understand why `javac` won&#39;t compile your code.\r\n\r\nYou wrote:\r\n\r\n&gt; `&lt;T extends Number&gt; void copy(Paar&lt;? extends Number&gt; src, Paar&lt;? extends Number&gt; dst)`\r\n\r\nThis method signature has __3 completely and utterly unrelated type variables__:\r\n\r\n* `T`, which is completely unused and thus pointless, is specifiable (the caller can explicitly pick the value for T if it wants, the system will infer it if they do not), and has a name, so you can use it in multiple places. You use it in zero places (a cast to generics does not count, it generates no code, checks nothing, and converts nothing. It mostly just emits a warning).\r\n* The first use of `? extends Number`. In generics terms, a `?` is identical to: Make up a new variable, give it this bound, use the variable here and nowhere else, and make it non-specifiable.\r\n* The second use of `? extends Number`.\r\n\r\nGiven that all 3 are completely unrelated, your code does not compile without crazy warnings and does not give you the type safety you desire: Casting the first argument to `T` is non-sensical (perhaps the first of the 3 is `Integer`, the second is `Character` - These are not type compatible!)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nQuick sidebar:\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s a minority report-style alternate interpretation here: That your intent is for the `copy` method to __convert one numeric type to another__ - that you intend for it to be possible to pass a `Paar&lt;Byte&gt;` as source and a `Paar&lt;Double&gt;` as target, and that the copy code will convert the bytes in source to doubles and then assign them to paar. I can see how the fact that these __utterly unrelated tasks__ (type coercion or assertion, vs. primitive conversion) are muddled up in your brain as being somehow similar. They are not - they are completely unrelated. But in java they so happen to use the exact same syntax (the &#39;cast&#39; operation: `(SomeType) someExpr)`. Make no mistake. This is as relevant as the fact that in english, the word `arm` means both a body part and the act of handing someone a gun. Unrelated. Completely. I&#39;m assuming this is _not_ what you want.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Let&#39;s fix your problem\r\n\r\nYou simply want to link the source and destination. You want to tell the compiler that there must be some relationship between the typevars on the `src` and `dest` Paar such that copying the values from one to the other can&#39;t go wrong.\r\n\r\nTo do this, we obviously need to have only a single parameter, first:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static &lt;T extends Number&gt; void copy(Paar&lt;T&gt; src, Paar&lt;T&gt; dst) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow it already compiles fine, though your `main` code still won&#39;t work, we&#39;ll fix that in a moment. The above code says: There is some type, we shall call it `T` and we have no idea what it is. We do restrict it: It&#39;s either Number or some subtype of Number. It&#39;s almost like there are a million versions of this method - one for Number and one for each and every subtype of it (and given that `Number` is not &#39;sealed&#39;, i.e. anybody can write code that `extends Number`, it&#39;s theoretically infinite, of course).\r\n\r\nPoint is, __there is only one type var__, so the caller can pick whatever type they want, as long as it is Number or a subtype of it, but, they only get to pick one type - __both__ `Paar` objects have that as their T. Thus, you simply __cannot__ call this method with e.g. a `Paar&lt;Double&gt;` and a `Paar&lt;Integer&gt;` - nothing can  be picked for T that works at this point (generics are __invariant__, meaning, `Number` wouldn&#39;t work here. Only the exact type will do).\r\n\r\nBut this is not _quite_ true, is it? There ARE different types available that still do &#39;work&#39; - specifically, if the T of the source Paar is a subtype of the T of the dest paar, that _does_ work, as in your example. So we need some slight tweak. You can pick one, it doesn&#39;t matter:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;T extends Number&gt; void copy(Paar&lt;T&gt; src, Paar&lt;? super T&gt; dst)\r\n\r\n&lt;T extends Number&gt; void copy(Paar&lt;? extends T&gt; src, Paar&lt;T&gt; dst)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEither one works. This is saying:\r\n\r\nThe caller gets to pick a type. Any type, as long as it is Number or a subtype of it. The caller is then on the hook to do the following:\r\n\r\nFor the first version:\r\n* For the first arg pass a `Paar` object whose T matches _exactly_ with the chosen `T` for this method invocation.\r\n* For the second arg, pass a `Paar` object whose T is either identical to the chosen `T` for this method invocation, __or__ any supertype of it.\r\n\r\nFor the second version:\r\n* For the first arg pass a `Paar` object whose T is either _exactly_ the chosen `T` for this method invocation, or any subtype of that T.\r\n* For the second arg, pass a `Paar` object whose T matches exactly.\r\n\r\nThe nice thing is, generally the caller does not have to explicitly pick a T, the compiler will infer one that &#39;works&#39;. They can explicitly pick if they want.\r\n\r\nNow your code works - if you go with the first idea, then `Bounds.copy(src, dst)` will mean the compiler picks `Integer` for T, and then the invoke works out: The first arg must be exactly `Paar&lt;Integer&gt;` (it is), and the second arg must be `Paar&lt;X&gt;` where X is Integer or one of its supertypes. It is - `Number` is a supertype of Integer. Thus, the call works. Note that you need _no_ casts to `(T)` any where in your copy code!\r\n\r\nIn the second case it also works - the compiler will pick `Number`, and then checks that the first arg is indeed a `Paar&lt;Y&gt;` where Y is Number or a subtype (it is; Integer is a subtype of Number), and if the second arg is exactly `Paar&lt;Number&gt;`, which it is.\r\n","title":"Changing argument parameters Generics involved","body":"<p>It can help to think of multiple valid 'values' for your type parameters and then think about what the method is supposed to mean for all values you thought of.

I can see how the fact that these <strong>utterly unrelated tasks</strong> (type coercion or assertion, vs. primitive conversion) are muddled up in your brain as being somehow similar. They are not - they are completely unrelated. But in java they so happen to use the exact same syntax (the 'cast' operation: <code>(SomeType) someExpr)</code>. Make no mistake.

I'm not sure why it issues an extra final digit.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":19118721,"reputation":6319,"user_id":13963086,"display_name":"k314159"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":297,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":72402278,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1653648146,"creation_date":1653574364,"question_id":72393237,"body_markdown":"Why is there a discrepancy in the display of the following value?\r\n\r\n    double x = (double)988530483551494912L;\r\n    System.out.printf(&quot;%f%n&quot;, x);           -&gt; 988530483551494910.000000\r\n    System.out.println(Double.toString(x)); -&gt; 9.8853048355149491E17\r\n    System.out.println(new BigDecimal(x));  -&gt; 988530483551494912\r\n\r\nAs you can see, both `toString()` and the `%f` conversion lose the precision of the last digit.
