Use tools like [YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/) (many others available) or even APMs like [NewRelic](https://newrelic.com/products/application-monitoring) (many others available as well). Understand where the bottlenecks are, fix the worsts, repeat. That being said, some usual suspects:\r\n\r\n- too many IOs (especially with JPA, e.g. [_select n+1_](https://vladmihalcea.com/n-plus-1-query-problem/)),\r\n- too many serialisations/deserialisations (especially with JPA, e.g. [eager fetching](https://vladmihalcea.com/eager-fetching-is-a-code-smell/)).\r\n\r\nBasically, JPA is _the_ usual suspect: it&#39;s a powerful tool, but very easy to misconfigure, you need to _think SQL_ to get it right IMHO. I highly recommend [logging the generated SQL queries](https://stackoverflow.com/q/2536829/1225328) when developing, you might be surprised. [Vlad Mihalcea&#39;s blog](https://vladmihalcea.com/tag/jpa/) is a good resource for JPA related things. Interesting read as well: [OrmHate by Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OrmHate.html).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nConcerning your specific code snippet, say you&#39;re going vanilla Java without Spring&#39;s `@Async` support:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nCompletableFuture&lt;ResponseEntity&lt;ResponseRequest&lt;CategoryBpsjResponseDto&gt;&gt;&gt; future = new CompletableFuture&lt;&gt;();\r\nfuture.complete(ResponseEntity.ok(new ResponseRequest&lt;&gt;(&quot;Okay&quot;, categoryBPSJService.save(request))));\r\nreturn future;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis won&#39;t make `categoryBPSJService.save(request)` run asynchronously. It will be made more obvious if you split your code a bit:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCategoryBpsjResponseDto categoryBPSJ = categoryBPSJService.save(request)\r\nCompletableFuture&lt;ResponseEntity&lt;ResponseRequest&lt;CategoryBpsjResponseDto&gt;&gt;&gt; future = new CompletableFuture&lt;&gt;();\r\nfuture.complete(ResponseEntity.ok(new ResponseRequest&lt;&gt;(&quot;Okay&quot;, categoryBPSJ)));\r\nreturn future;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee what happened here? `categoryBPSJ` will be called synchronously, and you&#39;ll then create an already-completed future holding the result. If you really wanted to use a CompletableFuture here, you&#39;d have to use a supplier:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCompletableFuture&lt;CategoryBpsjResponseDto&gt; future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(\r\n    () -&gt; categoryBPSJService.save(request),\r\n    someExecutor\r\n);\r\nreturn future.thenApply(categoryBPSJ -&gt; ResponseEntity.ok(new ResponseRequest&lt;&gt;(&quot;Okay&quot;, categoryBPSJ)));\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Spring&#39;s `@Async`](https://spring.io/guides/gs/async-method/) is basically just syntax sugar for the above, use either/or. For technical AOP/proxying reasons, a method annotated with `@Async` does need to return a CompletableFuture indeed, in which case returning an already-completed future is fine: Spring will make it run in an executor anyway. The service layer is usually the one being &quot;async&quot; though, the controller just consumes and composes over the returned future:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCompletableFuture&lt;CategoryBpsjResponseDto&gt; = categoryBPSJService.save(request);\r\nreturn future.thenApply(categoryBPSJ -&gt; ResponseEntity.ok(new ResponseRequest&lt;&gt;(&quot;Okay&quot;, categoryBPSJ)));\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure it all behaves as you expect by debugging your code, IDEs show which thread is currently being blocked by a breakpoint.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSide note: that&#39;s a simplified summary of what I understood from blocking vs non-blocking, MVC vs WebFlux, sync vs async, etc. It&#39;s quite superficial, some of my points might not be specific enough to be 100% true.","title":"is using @Async and CompletableFuture in controller can increase performance of our api?","body":"<p>Using CompletableFuture won't magically improve the performances of your server.</p>\n<p>If you're using <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web.html#mvc\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Spring MVC</a>, built on the Servlet API usually on top of Jetty or Tomcat, you'll have one thread per request.

Use tools like <a href=\"https://www.yourkit.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">YourKit</a> (many others available) or even APMs like <a href=\"https://newrelic.com/products/application-monitoring\" rel=\"noreferrer\">NewRelic</a> (many others available as well). Understand where the bottlenecks are, fix the worsts, repeat. That being said, some usual suspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>too many IOs (especially with JPA, e.g. <a href=\"https://vladmihalcea.com/n-plus-1-query-problem/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>select n+1</em></a>),</li>\n<li>too many serialisations/deserialisations (especially with JPA, e.g. <a href=\"https://vladmihalcea.com/eager-fetching-is-a-code-smell/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">eager fetching</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Basically, JPA is <em>the</em> usual suspect: it's a powerful tool, but very easy to misconfigure, you need to <em>think SQL</em> to get it right IMHO. I highly recommend <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/2536829/1225328\">logging the generated SQL queries</a> when developing, you might be surprised. <a href=\"https://vladmihalcea.com/tag/jpa/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vlad Mihalcea's blog</a> is a good resource for JPA related things. Interesting read as well: <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OrmHate.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OrmHate by Martin Fowler</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Concerning your specific code snippet, say you're going vanilla Java without Spring's <code>@Async</code> support:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>CompletableFuture&lt;ResponseEntity&lt;ResponseRequest&lt;CategoryBpsjResponseDto&gt;&gt;&gt; future = new CompletableFuture&lt;&gt;();\nfuture.complete(ResponseEntity.ok(new ResponseRequest&lt;&gt;(&quot;Okay&quot;, categoryBPSJService.save(request))));\nreturn future;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This won't make <code>categoryBPSJService.save(request)</code> run asynchronously. It will be made more obvious if you split your code a bit:</p>\n<pre><code>CategoryBpsjResponseDto categoryBPSJ = categoryBPSJService.save(request)\nCompletableFuture&lt;ResponseEntity&lt;ResponseRequest&lt;CategoryBpsjResponseDto&gt;&gt;&gt; future = new CompletableFuture&lt;&gt;();\nfuture.complete(ResponseEntity.ok(new ResponseRequest&lt;&gt;(&quot;Okay&quot;, categoryBPSJ)));\nreturn future;\n</code></pre>\n<p>See what happened here? <code>categoryBPSJ</code> will be called synchronously, and you'll then create an already-completed future holding the result. If you really wanted to use a CompletableFuture here, you'd have to use a supplier:</p>\n<pre><code>CompletableFuture&lt;CategoryBpsjResponseDto&gt; future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(\n    () -&gt; categoryBPSJService.save(request),\n    someExecutor\n);\nreturn future.thenApply(categoryBPSJ -&gt; ResponseEntity.ok(new ResponseRequest&lt;&gt;(&quot;Okay&quot;, categoryBPSJ)));\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://spring.io/guides/gs/async-method/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Spring's <code>@Async</code></a> is basically just syntax sugar for the above, use either/or. For technical AOP/proxying reasons, a method annotated with <code>@Async</code> does need to return a CompletableFuture indeed, in which case returning an already-completed future is fine: Spring will make it run in an executor anyway. The service layer is usually the one being &quot;async&quot; though, the controller just consumes and composes over the returned future:</p>\n<pre><code>CompletableFuture&lt;CategoryBpsjResponseDto&gt; = categoryBPSJService.save(request);\nreturn future.thenApply(categoryBPSJ -&gt; ResponseEntity.ok(new ResponseRequest&lt;&gt;(&quot;Okay&quot;, categoryBPSJ)));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Make sure it all behaves as you expect by debugging your code, IDEs show which thread is currently being blocked by a breakpoint.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Side note: that's a simplified summary of what I understood from blocking vs non-blocking, MVC vs WebFlux, sync vs async, etc. It's quite superficial, some of my points might not be specific enough to be 100% true.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":3153451,"reputation":3590,"user_id":2666368,"accept_rate":79,"display_name":"Ke Vin"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":8038,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":19,"accepted_answer_id":65185737,"answer_count":1,"score":19,"last_activity_date":1670238860,"creation_date":1606971870,"question_id":65120202,"body_markdown":"What I am trying to achieve is can I get a better performance by using @Async and CompletableFuture as result in my controller of my RESTApi by using the multi threading in this simple way?\r\n\r\nhere is what I do, here is my controller :\r\n\r\n    @PostMapping(&quot;/store&quot;)\r\n    @Async\r\n    public CompletableFuture&lt;ResponseEntity&lt;ResponseRequest&lt;CategoryBpsjResponseDto&gt;&gt;&gt; saveNewCategoryBPSJ(@Valid @RequestBody InputRequest&lt;CategoryBPSJRequestDto&gt; request) {\r\n    \t\r\n    \tCompletableFuture&lt;ResponseEntity&lt;ResponseRequest&lt;CategoryBpsjResponseDto&gt;&gt;&gt; future = new CompletableFuture&lt;&gt;();\r\n    \r\n    \tfuture.complete(ResponseEntity.ok(new ResponseRequest&lt;&gt;(&quot;Okay&quot;, categoryBPSJService.save(request))));\r\n        return future;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**VS**\r\n\r\n\r\n    @PostMapping(&quot;/store&quot;)\r\n    public ResponseEntity&lt;ResponseRequest&lt;CategoryBpsjResponseDto&gt;&gt; saveNewCategoryBPSJ(@Valid @RequestBody InputRequest&lt;CategoryBPSJRequestDto&gt; request) {\r\n    \t\r\n        return ResponseEntity.ok(new ResponseRequest&lt;&gt;(&quot;okay&quot;, categoryBPSJService.save(request));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nas you can see in my first controller function, I add the CompletableFuture on my function response, but in my service, which is I do save in this line `categoryBPSJService.save(request)` is not async, just a simple function that looked like this :\r\n\r\n    public CategoryBpsjResponseDto save(InputRequest&lt;CategoryBPSJRequestDto&gt; request) {\r\n        CategoryBPSJRequestDto categoryBPSJDto = request.getObject();\r\n    \r\n        Boolean result = categoryBPSJRepository.existsCategoryBPSJBycategoryBPSJName(categoryBPSJDto.getCategoryBPSJName());\r\n    \r\n        if(result){\r\n            throw new ResourceAlreadyExistException(&quot;Category BPSJ &quot;+ categoryBPSJDto.getCategoryBPSJName() + &quot; already exists!&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        CategoryBPSJ categoryBPSJ = new CategoryBPSJ();\r\n        categoryBPSJ = map.DTOEntity(categoryBPSJDto);\r\n    \r\n        categoryBPSJ.setId(0L);\r\n        categoryBPSJ.setIsDeleted(false);\r\n    \r\n        CategoryBPSJ newCategoryBPSJ = categoryBPSJRepository.save(categoryBPSJ);\r\n        \r\n        CategoryBpsjResponseDto categoryBpsjResponseDto = map.entityToDto(newCategoryBPSJ);\r\n    \r\n        return categoryBpsjResponseDto;\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nI just return simple Object with JPA connection, with this is way will my request performance increased?

does not support the new features introduced in Java 17, such as records. In order to use Java 17 features with Maven, you will need to use a more recent version of Maven that includes support for Java 17.\r\n\r\nYou can check the compatibility of Maven versions with Java versions in the Maven documentation [1]. According to the documentation, Maven 3.6.3 and later versions support Java 17.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to use Java 17 features with Maven, you will need to upgrade to a more recent version of Maven, such as version 3.6.3 or later. Once you have upgraded to a compatible version of Maven, you should be able to compile and use your record class without encountering the Unknown element error.\r\n\r\n[1] https://maven.apache.org/docs/history.html#Java_Versions","title":"UnknownElementException on Java 17 record class","body":"<p>With excitement I downloaded Java 17 today and got a simple record class</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public record TestCls(Party producer, Party client, Party server) {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>However when doing <code>mvn compile</code>, it throws me error\n<code>Fatal error compiling: javax.lang.model.element.UnknownElementException: Unknown element: &quot;com.xxx.TestCls&quot;</code></p>\n<p>I double checked <code>java -version</code> and it looks right to me:</p>\n<pre><code>openjdk version &quot;17&quot; 2021-09-14\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17+35-2724)\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17+35-2724, mixed mode, sharing)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Would anyone have a clue?

does not support the new features introduced in Java 17, such as records. In order to use Java 17 features with Maven, you will need to use a more recent version of Maven that includes support for Java 17.</p>\n<p>You can check the compatibility of Maven versions with Java versions in the Maven documentation [1]. According to the documentation, Maven 3.6.3 and later versions support Java 17.</p>\n<p>Therefore, to use Java 17 features with Maven, you will need to upgrade to a more recent version of Maven, such as version 3.6.3 or later. Once you have upgraded to a compatible version of Maven, you should be able to compile and use your record class without encountering the Unknown element error.</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/docs/history.html#Java_Versions\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://maven.apache.org/docs/history.html#Java_Versions</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["java","generics"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":23783500,"reputation":5175,"user_id":17795888,"display_name":"Chaosfire"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1670236262,"creation_date":1670231470,"answer_id":74685743,"question_id":74683598,"body_markdown":"You need to provide the element type as method parameter and use [TypeFactory][1], more precisely [TypeFactory.constructCollectionType(collectionClass, elementClass)][2] to build the `JavaType` dynamically at runtime.\r\n\r\nAdditionally i would suggest to use `InputStream` as the parameter, it&#39;s more generic and you can use the method with basically anything (file streams, you can convert text to streams, other streams).\r\n```\r\npublic class Test {\r\n\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    try (FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream(&quot;path-to-file&quot;)) {\r\n      List&lt;A&gt;

In the second you need to preprocess the request to remove the company and then document the employees array.</p>\n\n<p>Your test would look something like this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>mockMvc.perform(get(\"/company/5\").accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))\n        .andExpect(status().isOk())\n        .andDo(document(\"company\",\n                responseFields(\n                        fieldWithPath(\"companyName\").description(\n                                \"The name of the company\"),\n                        fieldWithPath(\"employee\").description(\n                                \"An array of the company's employees\"))))\n        .andDo(document(\"employee\",\n                preprocessResponse(removeCompany()),\n                responseFields(\n                        fieldWithPath(\"employee[].name\").description(\n                                \"The name of the employee\"),\n                        fieldWithPath(\"employee[].age\").description(\n                                \"The age of the employee\"))));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note the use of <code>preprocessResponse</code> in the second <code>document</code> call. <code>removeCompany</code> returns a preprocessor that uses a custom <code>ContentModifier</code> to remove company name from the response:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private OperationPreprocessor removeCompany() {\n    return new ContentModifyingOperationPreprocessor(new ContentModifier() {\n\n        @Override\n        public byte[] modifyContent(byte[] originalContent, MediaType contentType) {\n            ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\n            try {\n                Map&lt;?, ?&gt; map = objectMapper.readValue(originalContent, Map.class);\n                map.remove(\"companyName\");\n                return objectMapper.writeValueAsBytes(map);\n            }\n            catch (IOException ex) {\n                return originalContent;\n            }\n        }\n\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You'll end up with two directories of snippets, one named <code>company</code> and one named <code>employee</code>. You can then use the <code>response-fields.adoc</code> snippet from each.</p>\n\n<p>While the above will work, it's harder than it needs to be. I've opened <a href=\"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-restdocs/issues/143\" rel=\"noreferrer\">an issue</a> so that the preprocessing to modify the response's content will no longer be necessary.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":20153373,"reputation":41,"user_id":14780186,"display_name":"3ric-T"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1670234082,"creation_date":1670234082,"answer_id":74686260,"question_id":32865427,"body_markdown":"This answer is for those who came here at the present time with the same question.

Once the first page worked it will render all following pages (tried up to about 40) without any issue.</p>\n<p>I am using PDFBox 2.0.24 (tried 2.0.8 as well).\nWhat could be the reason for that behaviour?</p>\n<p>I can not share the any of the PDFs because it contains personal data but since it works on my main PC I think it does not have anything to do with the files.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":26040318,"reputation":21,"user_id":19745248,"display_name":"Mahrukh Saeed"},"score":0,"creation_date":1670225305,"post_id":74684430,"comment_id":131817757,"body_markdown":"Anyone please help me out?","body":"Anyone please help me out?"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":12086498,"reputation":58,"user_id":11673880,"display_name":"Ankit Dabhi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1670232484,"creation_date":1670232484,"answer_id":74685935,"question_id":74684430,"body_markdown":"Replace your Query with below: \r\n\r\n    @Query(value =&quot;select exists(select * from class_curriculummap where ClassId =?1 And CurriculumMapId=&#39;?2&#39;)&quot;, nativeQuery = true)\r\n    boolean isExists findByClassIdAndCurriculumMapId(Long classId, String curriculumMapId);\r\n\r\nFor more details, please refer to this article : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/639854/check-if-a-row-exists-otherwise-insert\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"How do i check if record already exists use same record else create in java using spring boot","body":"<p>Replace your Query with below:</p>\n<pre><code>@Query(value =&quot;select exists(select * from class_curriculummap where ClassId =?1 And CurriculumMapId='?2')&quot;, nativeQuery = true)\nboolean isExists findByClassIdAndCurriculumMapId(Long classId, String curriculumMapId);\n</code></pre>\n<p>For more details, please refer to this article : <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/639854/check-if-a-row-exists-otherwise-insert\">Check if a row exists, otherwise insert</a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":26040318,"reputation":21,"user_id":19745248,"display_name":"Mahrukh Saeed"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":83,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1670232484,"creation_date":1670223823,"question_id":74684430,"body_markdown":"I want to check if user alraedy exits use same data else create new record\r\n\r\n`\r\n```\r\n@EventHandler\r\n@Override\r\npublic void on(ContentSaveUserEvent event) {\r\n        var existingRecord =classesCurriculumMapRepository.findByClassIdAndCurriculumMapId(Long.valueOf(event.getClassId()), event.getCurriculumMapId());\r\n        if (!existingRecord.isEmpty()) {\r\n            // here i want to use same record if already exits based on classid and curriculummapid\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            Class_CurriculumMap classCurriculumMap= new Class_CurriculumMap();\r\n            classCurriculumMap.setId(new Class_CurriculumMapPK(Long.valueOf(event.getClassId()), event.getCurriculumMapId()));\r\n            classCurriculumMap.setDateLastModified(new Date());\r\n            classCurriculumMap.setUserLastModified(event.getUctx().getUserId());\r\n            classCurriculumMap.setStatus(Status.Active.value);\r\n            classesCurriculumMapRepository.save(classCurriculumMap);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`\r\n\r\nthe query i am using is:\r\n`\r\n```\r\n@Query(value =&quot;select * from class_curriculummap where ClassId =?1 And CurriculumMapId=&#39;?2&#39;&quot;, nativeQuery = true)\r\nList&lt;Class_CurriculumMap&gt;

There is indeed very few documentation to address this case, which is unfortunate.\r\nI spent some time to investigate this problem and I found a way to make it work. Here are the steps to take.\r\n- Bundle your application packages within a custom JRE by using the &#39;jlink&#39; tool provided by the JDK: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/tools/jlink.html\r\n- Use the class loader to find your main class. To do this in JNI, you can use the &quot;FindClass()&quot; function : https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/specs/jni/functions.html#findclass\r\n\r\nThe first step removes the requirement to define the &#39;--module-path&#39; flag that is not supported by JNI. Note that to properly bundle your application, all you jars must be converted to modular jars. Third-party jars may not be true modular jars but rather automatic modules, but automatic modules are not supported by  jlink (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52518105/using-jlink-with-automatic-modules). Fortunately, there is a method to perform this automatically documented here : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47727869/creating-module-info-for-automatic-modules-with-jdeps-in-java-9\r\n\r\nThe second step works even if your class lies within a module. Notes that the class name parameter for a class &#39;p1.p2.p3.MyClass&#39; must be &#39;p1/p2/p3/MyClass&#39;.
