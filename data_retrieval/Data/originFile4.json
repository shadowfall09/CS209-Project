For a `Subscriber`: When an `onComplete` or `onError` has been received.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent the termination of the `Publisher` in Reactor, you can `try/catch` or use `onErrorContinue` depending on your requirements.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion there is nothing wrong with `try/catch` and sometimes like in the following scenario, it&#39;s the best solution, because `onErrorContinue` will skip all error events, and sometimes you will handle terminal and non-terminal exceptions in the same chain of operators, for example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        Flux.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)\r\n            .map(item -&gt; {\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;item = &quot; + item);\r\n                if (item.equals(5)) {\r\n                    throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Terminal event&quot;); // terminal exception\r\n                }\r\n                return item;\r\n            })\r\n            .mapNotNull(item -&gt; {\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;item = &quot; + item);\r\n                if (item.equals(3))  {\r\n                    throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Non-terminal event&quot;); // non-terminal exception\r\n                }\r\n                return item;\r\n            })\r\n            .onErrorContinue((error, item) -&gt; {\r\n                System.out.println(error.getMessage());\r\n            }).subscribe(item -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;got element :&quot; + item));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, both exceptions thrown are the same type, but one is considered a terminal event. The correct solution for this problem in my opinion is using `try/catch` inside `flatMap/concatMap` instead of `onErrorContinue`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        Flux.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)\r\n            .map(item -&gt; {\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;item = &quot; + item);\r\n                if (item.equals(5)) {\r\n                    throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Terminal event&quot;); // terminal exception\r\n                }\r\n                return item;\r\n            })\r\n            .concatMap(item -&gt; {\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;item = &quot; + item);\r\n                try {\r\n                    if (item.equals(3))  {\r\n                        throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Non-terminal event&quot;); // non-terminal exception\r\n                    }\r\n                    return Flux.just(item);\r\n                } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {\r\n                    return Flux.empty();\r\n                }\r\n            })\r\n            .subscribe(item -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;got element :&quot; + item));\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way the terminal event will end the `Publisher`, and the non-terminal event will be processed, preventing the emission by returning `Flux.empty()` in case of exception.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm#term_terminal_state","title":"Is it wrong to use &quot;try catch&quot; inside a reactive stream operator(project reactor)?","body":"<p>In Reactive Streams when an error is signaled, the publisher is considered terminated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm#term_terminal_state\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Terminal State</a>: For a <code>Publisher</code>: When <code>onComplete</code> or <code>onError</code> has been signalled.

But in this case field countries will be located on the first place in json.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":406460,"reputation":1550,"user_id":775987,"accept_rate":63,"display_name":"justSaid"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":95095,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":118,"accepted_answer_id":19272931,"answer_count":7,"score":118,"last_activity_date":1702281124,"creation_date":1381323694,"question_id":19272830,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m using *ObjectMapper* to do my java-json mapping.\r\n\r\n    ObjectWriter ow = new ObjectMapper().writer().withDefaultPrettyPrinter();\r\n    ow.writeValue(new File( fileName +&quot;.json&quot;), jsonObj);\r\n\r\nthis is my java class:\r\n\r\n    public class Relation {\r\n\r\n\tprivate String id;\r\n\tprivate String source;\r\n\tprivate String target;\r\n\tprivate String label;\r\n\tprivate List&lt;RelAttribute&gt; attributes;\r\n\r\n\tpublic String getId() {\r\n\t\treturn id;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic void setId(String id) {\r\n\t\tthis.id = id;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic String getSource() {\r\n\t\treturn source;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic void setSource(String source) {\r\n\t\tthis.source = source;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic String getTarget() {\r\n\t\treturn target;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic void setTarget(String target) {\r\n\t\tthis.target = target;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic String getLabel() {\r\n\t\treturn label;\r\n\t}\r\n\tpublic void setLabel(String label) {\r\n\t\tthis.label = label;\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tpublic void setAttributes(List&lt;RelAttribute&gt; attributes) {\r\n\t\tthis.attributes = attributes;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic List&lt;RelAttribute&gt; getAttributes() {\r\n\t\treturn attributes;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nthis is what I get:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;id&quot; : &quot;-75da69d3-79c8-4000-a3d8-b10350a57a7e&quot;,\r\n        &quot;attributes&quot; : [ {\r\n          &quot;attrName&quot; : &quot;ID&quot;,\r\n          &quot;attrValue&quot; : &quot;&quot;\r\n        }, {\r\n          &quot;attrName&quot; : &quot;Description&quot;,\r\n          &quot;attrValue&quot; : &quot;Primary Actor&quot;\r\n        }, {\r\n          &quot;attrName&quot; : &quot;Status&quot;,\r\n          &quot;attrValue&quot; : &quot;&quot;\r\n        } ],\r\n        &quot;label&quot; : &quot;new Label&quot;,\r\n        &quot;target&quot; : &quot;-46b238ac-b8b3-4230-b32c-be9707f8b691&quot;,\r\n        &quot;source&quot; : &quot;-daa34638-061a-45e0-9f2e-35afd6c271e0&quot;\r\n      }\r\n\r\nSo my question now is, how can I get this json output:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;id&quot; : &quot;-75da69d3-79c8-4000-a3d8-b10350a57a7e&quot;,\r\n        &quot;label&quot; : &quot;new Label&quot;,\r\n        &quot;target&quot; : &quot;-46b238ac-b8b3-4230-b32c-be9707f8b691&quot;,\r\n        &quot;source&quot; : &quot;-daa34638-061a-45e0-9f2e-35afd6c271e0&quot;,\r\n        &quot;attributes&quot; : [ {\r\n          &quot;attrName&quot; : &quot;ID&quot;,\r\n          &quot;attrValue&quot; : &quot;&quot;\r\n        }, {\r\n          &quot;attrName&quot; : &quot;Description&quot;,\r\n          &quot;attrValue&quot; : &quot;Primary Actor&quot;\r\n        }, {\r\n          &quot;attrName&quot; : &quot;Status&quot;,\r\n          &quot;attrValue&quot; : &quot;&quot;\r\n        } ]\r\n\r\n      }\r\n\r\nI want it with same order as in my java declaration.

Why can't they invoke your method like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//should compile\nList&lt;Object&gt; l1 = createArrayListFullOfEmptyStrings(5); \nList&lt;CharSequence&gt; l2 = createArrayListFullOfEmptyStrings(5);\nList&lt;String&gt; l3 = createArrayListFullOfEmptyStrings(5);\n\n//shouldn't compile\nList&lt;Integer&gt; l4 = createArrayListFullOfEmptyStrings(5);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At this point I would be tempted to try the following definition:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static &lt;T super String&gt; List&lt;T&gt; createArrayListFullOfEmptyStrings(int size) {\n  List&lt;T&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;T&gt;(size);\n  for(int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {\n     list.add(\"\");\n  }\n  return list;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But it will not compile; the <code>super</code> keyword is illegal in this context.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is my example above a bad example (ignoring what I say below)?  Why isn't a lower bound useful here?  And if it would be useful, what's the real reason that it is not permitted in Java?</strong></p>\n\n<h2>P.S.</h2>\n\n<p>I know that a better organization <em>might</em> be something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void populateListWithEmptyStrings(List&lt;? super String&gt; list, int size);\n\nList&lt;CharSequence&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;CharSequence&gt;();\npopulateListWithEmptyStrings(list, 5);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can we for the purpose of this question pretend that due to a requirement, we need to do both operations in one method call?</p>\n\n<h2>Edit</h2>\n\n<p>@Tom G (justifiably) asks what benefit having a <code>List&lt;CharSequence&gt;</code> would have over a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code>.  For one, nobody said the returned list is immutable, so here's one advantage:</p>\n\n<pre><code>List&lt;CharSequence&gt; l2 = createArrayListFullOfEmptyStrings(5);\nl2.add(new StringBuilder(\"foo\").append(\"bar\"));\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","swing","intellij-idea"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":44852,"reputation":322224,"user_id":131872,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"camickr"},"score":4,"creation_date":1702258356,"post_id":77637031,"comment_id":136870800,"body_markdown":"*Online I&#39;ve only found people who say you have to do it from scratch* - exactly, because you learn Swing and NOT the IDE.

The blocks themselves are ordered recursively, according to the Steinhaus–Johnson–Trotter algorithm for one less element. \r\n\r\nthe positions in which n is placed occur either in descending or ascending order, and the blocks alternate between these two orders: the placements of n in the first block are in descending order, in the second block they are in ascending order, in the third block they are in descending order, and so on.\r\n\r\nThus, from the single permutation on one element,\r\n\r\n    1\r\n\r\none may place the number 2 in each possible position in descending order to form a list of two permutations on two elements,\r\n\r\n    1 2\r\n    2 1\r\n\r\nThen, one may place the number 3 in each of three different positions for these two permutations, in descending order for the first permutation 1 2, and then in ascending order for the permutation 2 1:\r\n\r\n    1 2 3\r\n    1 3 2\r\n    3 1 2\r\n    3 2 1\r\n    2 3 1\r\n    2 1 3\r\n\r\n\r\nTo learn more check: \r\n1.
