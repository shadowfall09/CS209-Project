With card layout i cannot add key listener, setFocusable or requestFocusableInWindow so my paddle is not moving when i start the game\r\n\r\nStop using `KeyListener`, it&#39;s not an appropriate mechanism for what you&#39;re trying to achieve, instead, use the [key bindings](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/keybinding.html) API, this will remove the need for all the

ruining my whole application\r\n\r\nThis has nothing to do with `CardLayout` but you choices in how you designed you original application.  Layouts are your friends, make the time to learn how to use them\r\n\r\n&gt; I don&#39;t see how I can update the background panel if its ALREADY added to the card pane, the only way I can think of is destroying it and adding a new one each time (which is what i have but is taking very long to load)\r\n\r\nThen don&#39;t - this is my whole point, you need to change the way you think about the problem.\r\n\r\nTo change the background image of the background pane, all you need to do is change the reference to the background image the panel is using.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d have a &quot;base&quot; pane, which would use a `BorderLayout` and contain the &quot;background&quot; pane.  The &quot;background&quot; pane would then have the `CardLayout` set to it and it would then become the parent container for all the other components.\r\n\r\nWhen the user selects a new image, you&#39;d make use of the &quot;observer pattern&quot; to generate a notification back to the &quot;base&quot; pane which would then assign the new image to the background pane.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve run out of room to post any new updates, so this the last one I can provide via a simple [gist](https://gist.github.com/RustyKnight/b49d80bae8343f5f8a0be60cccc59144)","title":"JLabel is not visible when JButton is clicked whilst JPanel is loading","body":"<p>Not been able to run the code leads to a number of assumptions.</p>\n<p>Based on you description, I would say you are blocking the Event Dispatching Thread while loading the image, this is going to prevent the UI from been updated.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Concurrency in Swing</a> for more details.

I don&#39;t know why, but my principal user that I&#39;m trying to authenticate is always null. \r\n\r\nSo here&#39;s the logic:\r\n\r\n1. First of all, here&#39;s all entities I created:\r\n\r\n```UserEntity```\r\n```java\r\n@Entity\r\n@Table(name = &quot;users&quot;)\r\npublic class UserEntity {\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\r\n    private long id;\r\n    private String email;\r\n    private String login;\r\n    private String password;\r\n    private String name;\r\n    private String surname;\r\n    @ManyToOne\r\n    @JoinColumn(name=&quot;schools_id&quot;)\r\n    private SchoolEntity school;\r\n    @ManyToOne\r\n    @JoinColumn(name=&quot;classes_id&quot;)\r\n    private ClassEntity userClass;\r\n\r\n    @ManyToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)\r\n    private List&lt;RoleEntity&gt; roles = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n    public UserEntity() {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public List&lt;RoleEntity&gt; getRoles() {\r\n        return roles;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setRoles(List&lt;RoleEntity&gt; roles) {\r\n        this.roles = roles;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getLogin() {\r\n        return login;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setLogin(String login) {\r\n        this.login = login;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public long getId() {\r\n        return id;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getEmail() {\r\n        return email;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setEmail(String email) {\r\n        this.email = email;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getPassword() {\r\n        return password;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setPassword(String password) {\r\n        this.password = password;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getName() {\r\n        return name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setName(String name) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getSurname() {\r\n        return surname;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setSurname(String surname) {\r\n        this.surname = surname;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public SchoolEntity getSchool() {\r\n        return school;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setSchool(SchoolEntity school) {\r\n        this.school = school;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public ClassEntity getUserClass() {\r\n        return userClass;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setUserClass(ClassEntity userClass) {\r\n        this.userClass = userClass;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```RoleEntity```\r\n```java\r\n@Entity\r\n@Table(name = &quot;roles&quot;)\r\npublic class RoleEntity {\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\r\n    private long id;\r\n    private String name;\r\n\r\n    public RoleEntity() {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public long getId() {\r\n        return id;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getName() {\r\n        return name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setName(String name) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```SchoolEntity```\r\n```java\r\n@Entity\r\n@Table(name = &quot;schools&quot;)\r\npublic class SchoolEntity {\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\r\n    private long id;\r\n    private String name;\r\n    @OneToMany(mappedBy = &quot;school&quot;)\r\n    private List&lt;UserEntity&gt; user;\r\n\r\n    public SchoolEntity() {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public long getId() {\r\n        return id;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public List&lt;UserEntity&gt; getUser() {\r\n        return user;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getName() {\r\n        return name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setName(String name) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ClassEntity```\r\n```java\r\n@Entity\r\n@Table(name = &quot;classes&quot;)\r\npublic class ClassEntity {\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)\r\n    private long id;\r\n    private int number;\r\n    private String letter;\r\n    @OneToMany(mappedBy = &quot;userClass&quot;)\r\n    private List&lt;UserEntity&gt; students;\r\n\r\n    public ClassEntity() {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public long getId() {\r\n        return id;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public int getNumber() {\r\n        return number;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setNumber(int number) {\r\n        this.number = number;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getLetter() {\r\n        return letter;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setLetter(String letter) {\r\n        this.letter = letter;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public List&lt;UserEntity&gt; getStudents() {\r\n        return students;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setStudents(List&lt;UserEntity&gt; students) {\r\n        this.students = students;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Then I added implementation of ```UserDetailsService``` to my ```UserService``` class, where I overrided ```loadUserByUsername```, which finds user by *login* field:\r\n```java\r\nService\r\npublic class UserService implements UserDetailsService {\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    private UserRepository userRepo;\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder;\r\n\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username) throws UsernameNotFoundException {\r\n        UserEntity user = userRepo.findByLogin(username);\r\n        if(user == null) {\r\n            throw new UsernameNotFoundException(&quot;user with such username doesn&#39;t exists&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n        ArrayList&lt;SimpleGrantedAuthority&gt; userRoles = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n        for(var role: user.getRoles()) {\r\n            userRoles.add(new SimpleGrantedAuthority(role.getName()));\r\n        }\r\n        User u =  new User(user.getLogin(), user.getPassword(), userRoles);\r\n        return u;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAnd how it shown on the screenshot, the ```UserDetails``` object was created:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/XJotb.png\r\n\r\n\r\n3. After this, I created the Authentication filter to make jwt tokens and authenticate users:\r\n```java\r\npublic class AuthenticationFilter extends UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter {\r\n    private final AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;\r\n\r\n    public AuthenticationFilter(AuthenticationManager authenticationManager) {\r\n        this.authenticationManager = authenticationManager;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public Authentication attemptAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws AuthenticationException {\r\n        String username = request.getParameter(&quot;username&quot;);\r\n        String password = request.getParameter(&quot;password&quot;);\r\n        UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken usernamePasswordAuthenticationToken =\r\n                new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(username, password);\r\n        return authenticationManager.authenticate(usernamePasswordAuthenticationToken);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void successfulAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response,\r\n                                            FilterChain chain, Authentication authentication) throws IOException, ServletException {\r\n        UserDetails userPrincipal = (User) request.getUserPrincipal();\r\n        Algorithm algorithm = JWTConfig.getAlgorithm();\r\n        String accessToken = JWT.create()\r\n                .withSubject(userPrincipal.getUsername())\r\n                .withExpiresAt(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + 30 * 1000 * 60))\r\n                .withClaim(&quot;roles&quot;, userPrincipal.getAuthorities().stream()\r\n                        .map(GrantedAuthority::getAuthority).collect(Collectors.toList()))\r\n                .sign(algorithm);\r\n        String refreshToken = JWT.create()\r\n                .withSubject(userPrincipal.getUsername())\r\n                .withExpiresAt(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + 60 * 1000 * 60))\r\n                .sign(algorithm);\r\n        Map&lt;String, String&gt; tokens = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n        tokens.put(&quot;access_token&quot;, accessToken);\r\n        tokens.put(&quot;refresh_token&quot;, refreshToken);\r\n        response.setContentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE);\r\n        new ObjectMapper().writeValue(response.getOutputStream(), tokens);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. I also created the Authorization filter. Here it is:\r\n```java\r\npublic class AuthorizationFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response,\r\n                                    FilterChain filterChain) throws ServletException, IOException {\r\n\r\n        String header = request.getHeader(HttpHeaders.AUTHORIZATION);\r\n        if(header != null &amp;&amp; header.startsWith(&quot;Bearer &quot;)) {\r\n            try {\r\n                String token = header.substring(&quot;Bearer &quot;.length());\r\n                JWTVerifier jwtVerifier = JWT.require(JWTConfig.getAlgorithm()).build();\r\n                DecodedJWT decodedJWT = jwtVerifier.verify(token);\r\n                String login = decodedJWT.getSubject();\r\n                List&lt;SimpleGrantedAuthority&gt; roles = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n                for (var role : decodedJWT.getClaim(&quot;roles&quot;).asArray(String.class)) {\r\n                    roles.add(new SimpleGrantedAuthority(role));\r\n                }\r\n                UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken usernamePasswordAuthenticationToken =\r\n                        new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(login, null, roles);\r\n                SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(usernamePasswordAuthenticationToken);\r\n                filterChain.doFilter(request, response);\r\n            } catch (Exception e) {\r\n                response.setHeader(&quot;error&quot;, e.getMessage());\r\n                response.sendError(403);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            filterChain.doFilter(request, response);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n5. After all of it, I set up the ```SecurityConfig```:\r\n```java\r\n@Configuration @EnableWebSecurity\r\npublic class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    UserDetailsService userDetailsService;\r\n    private final BCryptPasswordEncoder bCryptPasswordEncoder = new BCryptPasswordEncoder();\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {\r\n        auth.userDetailsService(userDetailsService).passwordEncoder(bCryptPasswordEncoder);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\r\n        AuthenticationFilter customAuthenticationFilter = new AuthenticationFilter(authenticationManagerBean());\r\n        customAuthenticationFilter.setFilterProcessesUrl(&quot;/api/login&quot;);\r\n        http.csrf().disable();\r\n        http.authorizeRequests().antMatchers(&quot;/api/login/**&quot;).permitAll();\r\n        http.sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS);\r\n        http.authorizeRequests().antMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, &quot;/api/users/&quot;).permitAll();\r\n        http.addFilter(customAuthenticationFilter);\r\n        http.addFilterBefore(new AuthorizationFilter(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    @Override\r\n    public AuthenticationManager authenticationManagerBean() throws Exception {\r\n        return super.authenticationManagerBean();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut when I start the programm, it tells me that the user principal I get in ```AuthenticationFilter``` is null. This is the line where exception was thrown:\r\n```java\r\nUserDetails userPrincipal = (User) request.getUserPrincipal();\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if you know, what can be the problem, please tell me. I&#39;d really apreciate it!","title":"Spring boot. userPrincipal is null","body":"<p>I'm new to java spring and I'm trying to practise my skills through developing my own app. And now I'm trying to create authorization using jwt tokens.

You can stream the download of several files in javascript, use that stream to create a zip and save this zip on user disk. \r\n\r\nThe advantages of moving the zipping to the frontend:\r\n - You can use it with S3 URLs, a bunch of presigned links or even mixing content from different sources, some from S3, some of whatever other place.\r\n - You don&#39;t waste lambda memory, nor have to up an EC2 fargate instance, that saves money. Let the user computer do it for you.\r\n - Improves user experience - no needs to wait the zip is created to start downloading it, just start downloading *meanwhile* the zip is being created.\r\n\r\n[StreamSaver](https://github.com/jimmywarting/StreamSaver.js) is useful for this purpose, but in their zipping examples ([Saving multiple files as a zip](https://jimmywarting.github.io/StreamSaver.js/examples/saving-multiple-files.html)) is limited by less than 4GB files as it doesn&#39;t implement zip64. You can combine StreamSaver with [client-zip](https://github.com/Touffy/client-zip), that support zip64, with something like this (I haven&#39;t test this):\r\n\r\n    import { downloadZip } from &#39;client-zip&#39;;\r\n    import streamSaver from &#39;streamsaver&#39;;\r\n    const files = [\r\n      {\r\n        &#39;name&#39;: &#39;file1.txt&#39;,\r\n        &#39;input&#39;: await fetch(&#39;test.com/file1&#39;)\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        &#39;name&#39;: &#39;file2.txt&#39;,\r\n        &#39;input&#39;: await fetch(&#39;test.com/file2&#39;)\r\n      },\r\n    ]\r\n    downloadZip(files).body.pipeTo(streamSaver.createWriteStream(&#39;final_name.zip&#39;));\r\n\r\nIn case you choose this option, keep in mind that if you have CORS enabled in your bucket you will need to add the frontend url where the zipping is done, right in the `AllowedOrigins` field from your CORS configuration of your bucket.\r\n\r\n**About performance:**\r\nAs @aviv-day complains in a comment this could not be suitable for all scenarios. Client-zip library has a benchmark that can give you an idea if this fit or not with your scenario. Generally, if you have a big set of small files (I don&#39;t have a number about what is big here, but I&#39;ll say something between 100 and 1000) it will take a lot of time just zipping it, and it will drain the final user CPU. Also, if you are offering the same set of files zipped for all the users, it&#39;s better zip it one and present it already zipped. Using this method of zipping in frontend works well with a limited small group of files that can dynamically change depending on user preferences about what to download. I&#39;ve no really test this and I really think the bottle neck would be the network speed more than the zip process, as it happens on the fly, I don&#39;t really think that scenario with a big set of files would actually be a problem. If anyone have benchmarks about this would be nice to share with us!\r\n ","title":"How to zip files in Amazon s3 Bucket and get its URL","body":"<p>Zip them in your end instead of doing it in AWS, ideally in frontend, directly on user browser. You can stream the download of several files in javascript, use that stream to create a zip and save this zip on user disk.</p>\n<p>The advantages of moving the zipping to the frontend:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use it with S3 URLs, a bunch of presigned links or even mixing content from different sources, some from S3, some of whatever other place.</li>\n<li>You don't waste lambda memory, nor have to up an EC2 fargate instance, that saves money. Let the user computer do it for you.</li>\n<li>Improves user experience - no needs to wait the zip is created to start downloading it, just start downloading <em>meanwhile</em> the zip is being created.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jimmywarting/StreamSaver.js\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">StreamSaver</a> is useful for this purpose, but in their zipping examples (<a href=\"https://jimmywarting.github.io/StreamSaver.js/examples/saving-multiple-files.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Saving multiple files as a zip</a>) is limited by less than 4GB files as it doesn't implement zip64. You can combine StreamSaver with <a href=\"https://github.com/Touffy/client-zip\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">client-zip</a>, that support zip64, with something like this (I haven't test this):</p>\n<pre><code>import { downloadZip } from 'client-zip';\nimport streamSaver from 'streamsaver';\nconst files = [\n  {\n    'name': 'file1.txt',\n    'input': await fetch('test.com/file1')\n  },\n  {\n    'name': 'file2.txt',\n    'input': await fetch('test.com/file2')\n  },\n]\ndownloadZip(files).body.pipeTo(streamSaver.createWriteStream('final_name.zip'));\n</code></pre>\n<p>In case you choose this option, keep in mind that if you have CORS enabled in your bucket you will need to add the frontend url where the zipping is done, right in the <code>AllowedOrigins</code> field from your CORS configuration of your bucket.</p>\n<p><strong>About performance:</strong>\nAs @aviv-day complains in a comment this could not be suitable for all scenarios. Client-zip library has a benchmark that can give you an idea if this fit or not with your scenario. Generally, if you have a big set of small files (I don't have a number about what is big here, but I'll say something between 100 and 1000) it will take a lot of time just zipping it, and it will drain the final user CPU. Also, if you are offering the same set of files zipped for all the users, it's better zip it one and present it already zipped. Using this method of zipping in frontend works well with a limited small group of files that can dynamically change depending on user preferences about what to download. I've no really test this and I really think the bottle neck would be the network speed more than the zip process, as it happens on the fly, I don't really think that scenario with a big set of files would actually be a problem.

The other three buttons are not displaying an Output at the bottom, can someone please help me with this?</p>\n<p><strong>MainActivity.java</strong></p>\n<pre><code>\nimport androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;\n\nimport android.os.Bundle;\nimport android.view.View;\nimport android.widget.Button;\nimport android.widget.EditText;\nimport android.widget.TextView;\n\n\n\npublic class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n    Button btnCompareString,btnreset,btnAddBothString,btnCountCharacter;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n\n        final EditText txtString1=(EditText) findViewById(R.id.txtString1);\n        final EditText txtString2=(EditText) findViewById(R.id.txtString2);\n        final TextView lblOutput=(TextView) findViewById(R.id.lblOutput);\n\n\n\n        btnAddBothString =(Button) findViewById(R.id.btnAddBothString);\n        btnAddBothString.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener()\n        {\n            @Override\n            public void onClick(View v) {\n                String string1=txtString1.getText().toString();\n                String string2=txtString2.getText().toString();\n\n                System.out.println(&quot;\\nString 1=&quot;+string1+&quot;\\n&quot;);\n                lblOutput.setText(&quot;Output: &quot;+string1+&quot; &quot;+string2);\n\n            }\n        });\n\n        btnCompareString =(Button) findViewById(R.id.btnCompareString);\n        btnCompareString.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener()\n        {\n\n            @Override\n            public void onClick(View v) {\n                String string1=txtString1.getText().toString();\n                String string2=txtString2.getText().toString();\n                if((string1.equals(string2)))\n                    lblOutput.setText(&quot;Output: Matching&quot;);\n                else\n                    lblOutput.setText(&quot;Output: Not matching&quot;);\n\n\n            }\n        });\n\n        btnCountCharacter =(Button) findViewById(R.id.btnCountCharacter);\n        btnCountCharacter.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener()\n        {\n\n            @Override\n            public void onClick(View v)\n            {\n                String string1=txtString1.getText().toString();\n                String string2=txtString2.getText().toString();\n\n                int charCount = 0,i;\n\n                String str = string1.toLowerCase();\n\n                for ( i = 0; i &lt; str.length(); i++)\n                {\n\n                    if (str.charAt(i) == 'a' || str.charAt(i) == 'e' || str.charAt(i) == 'i' || str.charAt(i) == 'o' || str.charAt(i) == 'u')\n                    {\n\n                        charCount++;\n                    }\n\n                }\n\n                String str2 = string2.toLowerCase();\n\n                for (i = 0; i &lt; str2.length(); i++)\n                {\n\n                    if (str2.charAt(i) == 'a' || str2.charAt(i) == 'e' || str2.charAt(i) == 'i' || str2.charAt(i) == 'o' || str2.charAt(i) == 'u')\n                    {\n\n                        charCount++;\n                    }\n\n                }\n                lblOutput.setText(&quot;Output: &quot;+charCount);\n\n            }\n        });\n        btnreset =(Button) findViewById(R.id.btnReset);\n        btnreset.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\n            @Override\n            public void onClick(View v) {\n\n                txtString1.setText(&quot;&quot;);\n                txtString2.setText(&quot;&quot;);\n                lblOutput.setText(&quot;&quot;);\n\n\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","spring-boot","spring-mvc","spring-security"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":4099584,"reputation":2238,"user_id":3365479,"accept_rate":80,"display_name":"madteapot"},"score":0,"creation_date":1619775456,"post_id":67331151,"comment_id":119012111,"body_markdown":"Last line of the stacktrace says this `&#39;encoder&#39;: Requested bean is currently in creation: Is there an unresolvable circular reference` which is pretty much self explanatory.

Each counter will represent a range of values. To start, you should decide what range each counter will represent.  Too fine a resolution, and your frequency distribution will not be very useful. For example, if your data is 100 meter sprint times for high school boys, and each counter represents an interval of 1/10,000 of a second, unless your sample size is very large, your frequency distribution would have a lot of values of &#39;1&#39; and &#39;0&#39;. You might want to separate by 1/10 of a second, 1 second, or 2 seconds, depending on how much variation there is in the boys&#39; times.\r\n\r\nBut, if your data is species of farm animals, it would be fine to have a separate counter for each possible value.  \r\n\r\nSo, determine how many counters you will need. What is the range of possible values?  How closely do you want to group them?  \r\n\r\nNext, you will want a means of linking a particular value to a particular counter. In some cases, a little math can be used. In other cases, an `if ... else if ...` chain or a `switch` block is useful.\r\n\r\nFor the first example, I want to analyze daily high temperatures. I decide to group by 10 degrees Fahrenheit. I could decide on 5 degrees, 7 degrees, or some other interval. It could even be irregular intervals. But, keeping it regular and going by 10 degrees makes the example easier to follow. \r\n\r\nHaving settled on grouping by 10 degrees, I next want to decide the maximum and minimum. I&#39;ll pick -19 as the coldest, and 119 as the hottest. But, I want to allow for occurrences outside of that range.  So, to hold the count, I will want an array of 15 counters.\r\n\r\nNext, I will want a means of &quot;translating&quot; a temperature measurement to an array index. I use the `int` variable `k` for that in the following code. To make it easier to follow, I broke the calculation into 4 lines and then used the result as a subscript:\r\n\r\n    public static int [] tempFreqDist (WeatherStats [] daily) {\r\n        int [] count = new int [15];  // java initializes to zeros\r\n        int k;\r\n        for (int dIdx = 0; dIdx &lt; daily.length; ++ dIdx) {\r\n              k = daily [dIdx].getHighTemp();\r\n              k = Math.max (k,-20);\r\n              k = Math.min (k,120);\r\n              k = k/10 + 2;\r\n              count [k]++;\r\n        }    \r\n        return count;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s it! One loop, and no sorting. \r\n\r\nWe want to group temps of -20 and colder together, regardless of how far below -20.  So, we use `Math.max`. Similarly, we group temps of 120 and hotter by using `Math.min`. Next, divide by our grouping factor, and adjust the result so the lowest has `0` for the subscript value. \r\n\r\nSo, the result is the elements of `count` correspond to the temperature ranges:  0 ➔ -20 and colder; 1 ➔ &quot;teens&quot; (10 to 19) below zero; 2 ➔ single digits below zero; 3 ➔ zero and single digits above; 4 ➔ teens above zero; 5 ➔ twenties, ..., 14 ➔ teens above 100; 14 ➔ 120 and above. \r\n\r\nBut, suppose the &#39;width&#39; of categories was irregular?  One possibility is that you could use a chain of `if ... else`:\r\n    \r\n    int t = daily [dIdx].getHighTemp();\r\n    if (t &lt;= -20) k = 0;       \r\n    else if (t &lt;= -13) k = 1;  \r\n    else if (t &lt;= 0) k = 2;\r\n    else if (t &lt;= 15) k = 3;\r\n    else if (t &lt;= 28) k = 4;\r\n\r\nand so on. \r\n\r\nAnother example counts animals you might see on a farm.  \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can do that with an `if ... else if ...` chain:\r\n\r\n     public int[] animalFD (String [] species) {\r\n        int [] count = new int [6]; \r\n          // 0 ➔ cattle, 1 ➔ pig, 2 ➔ sheep, \r\n          // 3 ➔ goat, 4 ➔ duck, 5 ➔ horse \r\n        ...\r\n        for (int m = 0; m &lt; species.length; ++m) {\r\n           if (species[m].equals(&quot;cow&quot;) count[0]++;\r\n           else if (species[m].equals(&quot;pig&quot;) count [1]++;\r\n           else if ... \r\n\r\nBut, for something like this, I prefer `switch` to `if ... else` chain:\r\n\r\n    public static int [] animalFD (String [] species) {\r\n        int [] count = new int [6];\r\n        for (int m = 0; m &lt; species.length; ++m) {\r\n            switch (letterGrade [m]) {\r\n                case &quot;cow&quot;: \r\n                    count[0]++;\r\n                    break;\r\n                case &quot;pig&quot;:\r\n                    count [1]++;\r\n                    break;\r\n                case &quot;sheep&quot;:\r\n                    count [2]++;\r\n                    break;\r\n                case &quot;goat&quot;:\r\n                    count [3]++;\r\n                    break;\r\n    ... \r\n\r\nHere is a &quot;trick&quot; you can use to easily convert a letter to an index.  Recall that a `char` is essentially a integer primitive: You can do numeric calculations on it.\r\n     \r\n     char letter;\r\n     int idx;\r\n     ...\r\n     if (letter &gt;= &#39;A&#39; &amp;&amp; letter &lt;= &#39;Z&#39;) { \r\n        idx = letter - &#39;A&#39;; // result is zero to 25\r\n     ... \r\n\r\nThis takes advantage of the fact that the letters A to Z are consecutive in character set encoding. However, that isn&#39;t universal.

Each occurrence is based off of another array which stores number marks and is randomly generated. So the results should look something like this:</p>\n<p>A: 6</p>\n<p>B: 10</p>\n<p>C:20</p>\n<p>D: 9</p>\n<p>E: 3</p>\n<p>F: 1</p>\n<p>instead I'm getting (copied from console):</p>\n<p>A: 1</p>\n<p>A: 2</p>\n<p>A: 3</p>\n<p>A: 4</p>\n<p>B: 5</p>\n<p>B: 6</p>\n<p>B: 7</p>\n<p>B: 8</p>\n<p>B: 9</p>\n<p>B: 10</p>\n<p>B: 11</p>\n<p>C: 11</p>\n<p>C: 11</p>\n<p>D: 11</p>\n<p>D: 11</p>\n<p>F: 11</p>\n<p>C: 20</p>\n<p>D: 9</p>\n<p>E: 3</p>\n<p>F: 1</p>\n<p>I've spent so long looking at these code and trying to make it work, I feel like I'm am blind to the potentially obvious issues with it. Any help on this 2 issues would be really appreciated!</p>\n<p>Also of note: The assignment requires a bunch of super specific methods such as this so that can't be changed, addition classes can not be used etc.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","multithreading","concurrency","parallel-processing","parallel.foreach"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":26059441,"reputation":83,"user_id":19761037,"display_name":"mpette"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1662239638,"creation_date":1662239638,"answer_id":73595445,"question_id":73595168,"body_markdown":"To make things confusing `total` and `total1` aren&#39;t even calculating the same thing:\r\n- `total` is trying to compute `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9`\r\n- `total1` is trying to compute `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ...`\r\n\r\nIf we just consider the threading though:\r\n- `total` calls the `deposit` method which is guarded by the lock.\r\n- `total1` calls the `add` method which is not guarded.\r\n\r\nTherefore `total` is predictable because the lock means only one thread at a time can do the add operation, but `total1` is unpredictable because many threads could be doing each add operation at the same time.","title":"Java Concurrency (Multithreading) - parallel() outcomes differ with tryLock()","body":"<p>To make things confusing <code>total</code> and <code>total1</code> aren't even calculating the same thing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>total</code> is trying to compute <code>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9</code></li>\n<li><code>total1</code> is trying to compute <code>1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ...</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we just consider the threading though:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>total</code> calls the <code>deposit</code> method which is guarded by the lock.</li>\n<li><code>total1</code> calls the <code>add</code> method which is not guarded.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore <code>total</code> is predictable because the lock means only one thread at a time can do the add operation, but <code>total1</code> is unpredictable because many threads could be doing each add operation at the same time.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":422870,"reputation":25925,"user_id":801894,"display_name":"Solomon Slow"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1662247985,"creation_date":1662247985,"answer_id":73595985,"question_id":73595168,"body_markdown":"&gt; I feel total should be unpredictable too as threads are not depending whether lock is acquired by tryLock() or not.\r\n\r\nI think you are right...
