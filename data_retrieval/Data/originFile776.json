That is a bit complicated. It would be better to make a subclass of ducks called &quot;FlyingDucks&quot; and then put Fly() in there. Then, all flying ducks will inherit that class. Alternately, made FLy() abstract, forcing every subclass to define what it means to fly. What they did was more work and more complicated.

The accepted answer of enabling:  &quot;Project&quot; - &quot;Build Automatically&quot; misses a subtlety here.</p>\n<p>The Eclipse project build in my case is only going to do a hot code replace, if I do the Eclipse build after the debugger is attached.   Yes, it will do the Eclipse build automatically, but if I restart my remote JVM and simply attach the debugger, it is still configured to load this class from my local .m2 JAR, and NOT pick up my local change.</p>\n<h3>FINAL NOTE ON THIS ANSWER VS.
