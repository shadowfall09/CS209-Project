I&#39;ve also tried overflow on the header, making the font size a percentage, and some other solutions I&#39;ve found just seemed very complicated, or included fixed heights which I was told was a no no. Here is my css\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    h1{ \r\n   color: #F7F88B;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n    a {\r\n    color: #F7F88B;\r\n    text-decoration: none;\r\n    font-weight: bold;\r\n    font-size: 100%;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n    body {\r\n\r\n    background-image: url(&quot;photos/mixmusebackground.jpg&quot;);\r\n    background-size:cover;  \r\n    background-repeat:no-repeat;    \r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nI suppose my goal is to change the size of the text relative to the image in the background so it stays in one place.

Can anyone tell me where I went wrong?</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import java.io.*;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String fileName = &quot;scratch.txt&quot;;\n        Scanner inputStream = null;\n        \n        try {\n            inputStream = new Scanner(new File(fileName));\n        } catch (FileNotFoundException exception) {\n            System.out.println(&quot;The file: &quot; + fileName + &quot; has not been found, exiting program.&quot;);\n            System.exit(0);\n        }\n        \n        int sum = 0;\n        int i = 0;\n        int max = 0;\n        int min = 0;\n    \n        while (inputStream.hasNextInt()) {\n            if (inputStream.nextInt() &gt; max) {\n                max = inputStream.nextInt();\n            }\n            sum = +inputStream.nextInt();\n            i++;\n        }\n        \n        System.out.println(max);\n        System.out.println(&quot;The integer average is: &quot; + sum / i);\n        inputStream.close();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Error output:</p>\n<pre><code>Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.util.NoSuchElementException\n    at java.base/java.util.Scanner.throwFor(Scanner.java:945)\n    at java.base/java.util.Scanner.next(Scanner.java:1602)\n    at java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextInt(Scanner.java:2267)\n    at java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextInt(Scanner.java:2221)\n    at Main.main(Main.java:27)\n\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","mockito","spy","spybean"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":39208,"reputation":251260,"user_id":112968,"accept_rate":68,"display_name":"knittl"},"score":1,"creation_date":1690750161,"post_id":76798289,"comment_id":135393182,"body_markdown":"What are you trying to test? `sp.giveChild(); verify(sp).giveChild();` is rather useless – it is obvious that the previous statement has called `giveChild`, why verify the call; don&#39;t you trust the compiler and JVM?","body":"What are you trying to test? <code>sp.giveChild(); verify(sp).giveChild();</code> is rather useless – it is obvious that the previous statement has called <code>giveChild</code>, why verify the call; don&#39;t you trust the compiler and JVM?"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2714073,"reputation":3615,"user_id":2341815,"accept_rate":59,"display_name":"Ruwanka De Silva"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1690731600,"creation_date":1690731600,"answer_id":76798493,"question_id":76798289,"body_markdown":"Yes\r\n\r\nIf your bean/component/service etc. is initialized and managed by spring context then you have to use `@SpyBean`\r\n\r\nMore on this available in `@SpyBean` [documentation][1].

Just define this object mapper as a Bean in your @Configuration class, and let Spring use it for deserialization automatically.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework#Spring_Boot\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"How can I specify deserialization order in Jackson?","body":"<p>I'd suggest to create a custom deserializer and register it in your object mapper for this particular class (say <code>MyDateObject</code>). Assuming <code>MyDateObject</code> has two fields - <code>startDate</code> &amp; <code>endDate</code>, you can impose deserializing <code>startDate</code> before <code>endDate</code> using something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>public class CustomDeserializer extends JsonDeserializer&lt;MyDateObject&gt; {\n    @Override\n    public MyDateObject deserialize(JsonParser jsonParser, DeserializationContext deserializationContext) throws IOException {\n        long startDate = 0;\n        long endDate = 0;\n        while (!jsonParser.isClosed()) {\n            String fieldName = jsonParser.nextFieldName();\n            if (fieldName == null) {\n                break;\n            }\n\n            // Check the field name and assign values\n            // to the corresponding fields\n            switch (fieldName) {\n                case &quot;startDate&quot;:\n                    startDate = jsonParser.nextLongValue(0L);\n                    break;\n\n                case &quot;endDate&quot;:\n                    endDate = jsonParser.nextLongValue(0L);\n                    break;\n\n                default:\n                    // If you have other fields in the JSON that\n                    // you want to ignore, you can skip them.\n                    jsonParser.skipChildren();\n                    break;\n            }\n        }\n        return generateNewMyDateObject(startDate, endDate);\n    }\n\n    private MyDateObject generateNewMyDateObject(long startDate, long endDate) {\n        MyDateObject myDate = new MyDateObject();\n        myDate.setStartDate(startDate);\n        myDate.setEndDate(endDate);\n        return myDate;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of course the code can be cleaner, but I'll leave it to you as the business expert. Basically, we keep the two values from the JSON content, and only after we got both of them, we generate the <code>MyDateObject</code>, with <code>startDate</code> first. Such that you can implement in the setter of <code>endDate</code> whatever you want, and you can assume <code>startDate</code> already has a value.</p>\n<p>Then, you can register this custom deserializer to your object mapper:</p>\n<pre><code>ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\nSimpleModule module = new SimpleModule();\nmodule.addDeserializer(MyDateObject.class, new CustomDeserializer());\nobjectMapper.registerModule(module);\n</code></pre>\n<p>And use this object mapper for deserialization:</p>\n<pre><code>String jsonString = &quot;{\\&quot;endDate\\&quot;:123,\\&quot;startDate\\&quot;:30}&quot;;\nMyDateObject customObject = objectMapper.readValue(jsonString, MyDateObject.class);\n</code></pre>\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> If you're using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework#Spring_Boot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Spring Boot</a>, it's even easier.

If you don't do that, you risk reporting spurious errors because you've guessed wrong about the true nature of the first error, and users get frustrated because the subsequent errors make no sense.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":19877744,"reputation":101,"user_id":14562385,"display_name":"shibendra chakraborty"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1690714946,"creation_date":1685250844,"question_id":76350034,"body_markdown":"My objective is to catch All error in XSD validation **for each and every &quot;complexType&quot;** in JAVA - But it is failing when xml has more than one error under a complexType element.\r\n\r\nI am using the Example code from -  ` https://www.baeldung.com/java-validate-xml-xsd `\r\n\r\nXSD used - \r\n```\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt;\r\n&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;xs:element name=&quot;individual&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;xs:complexType&gt;\r\n            &lt;xs:sequence&gt;\r\n                &lt;xs:element name=&quot;name&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot; /&gt;\r\n                &lt;xs:element name=&quot;address&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;\r\n                        &lt;xs:sequence&gt;\r\n                            &lt;xs:element name=&quot;zip&quot; type=&quot;xs:positiveInteger&quot; /&gt;\r\n                            &lt;xs:element name=&quot;city&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot; /&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;\r\n                &lt;/xs:element&gt;\r\n            &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;\r\n        &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;\r\n    &lt;/xs:element&gt;\r\n&lt;/xs:schema&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nXML used with errors introduced -\r\n```\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt;\r\n&lt;individual&gt;\r\n    &lt;name&gt;Baeldung&lt;/name&gt;\r\n    &lt;age&gt;&lt;/age&gt; &lt;!-- error1 --&gt;\r\n    &lt;salary&gt;&lt;/salary&gt; &lt;!-- error2 --&gt;\r\n    &lt;address&gt;\r\n        &lt;zip&gt;00001&lt;/zip&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;state&gt;&lt;/state&gt; &lt;!-- error3 --&gt;\r\n        &lt;city&gt;New York&lt;/city&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;country&gt;&lt;/country&gt; &lt;!-- error4 --&gt;\r\n    &lt;/address&gt;\r\n&lt;/individual&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\njava code has the implementation of ErrorHandler from the above link .\r\n\r\n    public class XmlErrorHandler implements ErrorHandler ....\r\n\r\nNow, as we see, in XML there are 4 new elements under 2 complexTypes.

The JavaFX application thread should never be slept or latched. \r\n\r\nTo play the media and ensure it is ready to take a snapshot at a chosen location:\r\n\r\n 1. Place the [`MediaView`][2] node in a [`scene`][3]. \r\n 2. Implement [media error handling][4] if needed.\r\n 3. [`mute`][5] the media player.\r\n 4. Use Media APIs to skip to a\r\n    location in the video using the [`seek`][6] API.\r\n 5. Monitor the [`status`][7]\r\n    of the media player.\r\n 6. [`play`][8] the video from the sought point.\r\n\r\nAfter the status switches to playing, use [`Platform.runLater`][9], to give the system time to render the required frame.  And in the `runLater` call perform the next steps:\r\n\r\n 1. take a [`snapshot` of the `MediaView` node][10].\r\n 2. then [`stop`][11] the `MediaPlayer`.\r\n 3. and [`dispose`][12] of the player.\r\n\r\nYour snapshot gives you a JavaFX [`image`][13] you can directly display in a JavaFX [`ImageView`][14].\r\n\r\nIf you need to save your snapshot image to disk:\r\n \r\n 1. After you take your snapshot, [convert the JavaFX `Image` to a `BufferedImage`][15]\r\n    using the `javafx-swing` module.\r\n    * added to your project similarly to `javafx-media`.\r\n 2. Write the buffered image to an appropriate format, e.g. `jpg` or `png` using [`ImageIO` apis][16]. \r\n    * if you choose to save as a jpg rather than a png, you might need to [remove the alpha channel](http://www.java2s.com/example/java/2d-graphics/remove-bufferedimage-alpha-channel.html), because jpg can’t handle alpha.\r\n\r\nIf your app is modular, then in your module-info include all of the required module dependencies to make this work:\r\n\r\n * `javafx.media`\r\n * `javafx.swing`\r\n * `java.desktop`\r\n\r\n**Recommended distribution**\r\n\r\nTo get your app functionality to end users, it is recommended to either:\r\n\r\n * Use the [`maven-javafx-plugin`][17], to create a [jlinked zip][18] of your app for your target platform,\r\n   * Users can use your app by unzipping the zip and executing the app by invoking the shell script created by [`jlink`][19].\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n * Use the [`jpackage`][20] system to create an installer for your app or if your app is not modular.\r\n   * Users can use your app by launching the installer to install the app on their system, which they can run as they do any other native app for the system.\r\n   * Using `jpackage` to package a non-modular application and create installers for various platforms is more complex than creating jlink zip distributions for modular applications.\r\n\r\nFor either of the above methods, the user will generally not have to install any other software on the target machine in order to use your app.\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\n * [Oracle JavaFX media tutorial][21].\r\n   * Somewhat dated, but still mostly relevant.\r\n * [OpenJFX getting started][22].  \r\n   * Make sure you can run the hello, world app from getting started before attempting the steps in this answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Alternatives**\r\n\r\n * As an alternative, [vlcj for JavaFX][23] can also take video snapshots\r\n   * but that requires [vlc][24] to be installed and is more complex to use than JavaFX media.\r\n * [ffmpeg][25] could also be used to take snapshots, for which I believe there may be Java bindings (I don&#39;t know that for sure) or the native process could be called from the [Java process API][26]\r\n   * but that also requires the native ffmpeg runtime to be available.\r\n   * ffmpeg command-line instructions (I haven&#39;t tried this):\r\n     * [How to extract one

Consider using a `ByteArrayOutputStream` or `BufferedOutputStream` instead.  You can use a `PrintWriter` or `OutputStreamWriter` to write textual data into it when needed.  Otherwise, use the `StringBuilder` *only* for preparing the HTTP response headers (as the name `header` implies), and then send the raw bytes of the target file separately in the HTTP response body.\r\n\r\n- in your constructor, you are appending 2 default lines to `header`, and then you are storing a 3rd empty line.  That 3rd line effectively terminates your HTTP response headers, causing everything you append to `header` afterwards to be treated as part of the HTTP response body, including subsequent calls to `addHeader()`.  Do not put the empty line into `header` until you are finished adding HTTP headers to it.  And, do not put an empty line after the HTTP body content at all.  That is not how an HTTP message is terminated.\r\n\r\n- in `renderImage()`, you are reading each byte from the image file and storing the text representation of the byte&#39;s numeric value into your `StringBuider`.  For example, if you read a byte `0xFF`, you store the text value `&quot;255&quot;` instead.  This is why your HTTP response is much larger than the image file&#39;s actual size, and why (in part) the browser thinks the image data is invalid (the other part is because of #1 above).\r\n\r\n- while not strictly necessary (because you are closing the socket connection after sending the response), you should include a `Content-Length` HTTP header to specify the actual byte size of the HTTP response body, no matter what file format you are sending.\r\n\r\nThat being said, there is a major problem with your `MochaClient` class, too. It is expecting the HTTP response to be purely textual only, it is not handling binary data at all.  It is just reading delimited lines of text until the server closes the connection.  This is the wrong way to read in an HTTP message.\r\n\r\nYou must stop reading lines once you have reached the empty line that separates the HTTP headers from the HTTP body.  Then you need to analyze the HTTP headers to figure out:\r\n\r\n1. what type of data the HTTP body contains (text vs binary, etc).\r\n\r\n2. how to read it (ie, chunked vs not, compressed vs not, etc).\r\n\r\n3. how the response is terminated (ie, via a 0-sized chunk, the `Content-Length` header, or a socket disconnect).\r\n\r\nOnly then can you actually read in the HTTP body accordingly until the end of the proper request is reached.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Java has its own built-in [`HttpServer`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jre/api/net/httpserver/spec/com/sun/net/httpserver/HttpServer.html) and [`HttpClient`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html) classes, consider using them instead of implementing the HTTP protocol from scratch.","title":"Java HTTP server is not rendering images properly","body":"<p>There are many problems with your <code>MochaResponse</code> class.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>you are using a <code>StringBuilder</code> to prepare your entire HTTP response.

Below is the code snippet of the method currently called inside the onCreate method of the activity to hide the assets:</p>\n<pre><code>public static void hideAssets(final Activity activity) {\n    WindowCompat.setDecorFitsSystemWindows(activity.getWindow(), false);\n    WindowInsetsControllerCompat windowInsetsControllerCompat = WindowCompat.getInsetsController\n            (activity.getWindow(), activity.getWindow().getDecorView());\n\n    windowInsetsControllerCompat.hide(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars());\n    windowInsetsControllerCompat.setSystemBarsBehavior(WindowInsetsControllerCompat.BEHAVIOR_SHOW_TRANSIENT_BARS_BY_SWIPE);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>These are the two themes of my app (one of them is for the splash/launch screen):</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;resources&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Default Theme of App --&gt;\n    &lt;style name=&quot;Theme.Eleanor&quot; parent=&quot;Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;windowNoTitle&quot;&gt;true&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;android:windowFullscreen&quot;&gt;true&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;colorPrimary&quot;&gt;#000F2E&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;colorPrimaryVariant&quot;&gt;#000F2E&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;colorOnPrimary&quot;&gt;@color/white&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;android:statusBarColor&quot;&gt;?attr/colorPrimaryVariant&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;android:navigationBarColor&quot;&gt;@android:color/transparent&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;android:windowContentTransitions&quot;&gt;true&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;android:windowBackground&quot;&gt;@android:color/transparent&lt;/item&gt;\n    &lt;/style&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Theme for the Launch Screen --&gt;\n    &lt;style name=&quot;Theme.Launch&quot; parent=&quot;Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;windowNoTitle&quot;&gt;true&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;android:windowFullscreen&quot;&gt;true&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;colorPrimary&quot;&gt;#000F2E&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;colorPrimaryVariant&quot;&gt;#000F2E&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;colorOnPrimary&quot;&gt;@color/white&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;android:statusBarColor&quot;&gt;?attr/colorPrimaryVariant&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;android:navigationBarColor&quot;&gt;@android:color/transparent&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;android:windowContentTransitions&quot;&gt;true&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item name=&quot;android:windowBackground&quot;&gt;@drawable/launch_screen&lt;/item&gt;\n    &lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;/resources&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is my android manifest:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;manifest xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;application\n        android:allowBackup=&quot;true&quot;\n        android:hardwareAccelerated=&quot;true&quot;\n        android:icon=&quot;@mipmap/ic_launcher&quot;\n        android:label=&quot;@string/app_name&quot;\n        android:roundIcon=&quot;@mipmap/ic_launcher_round&quot;\n        android:theme=&quot;@style/Theme.Eleanor&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;activity android:name=&quot;.activity.SplashActivity&quot;\n            android:screenOrientation=&quot;portrait&quot;\n            android:exported=&quot;true&quot;\n            android:theme=&quot;@style/Theme.Launch&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;intent-filter&gt;\n                &lt;action android:name=&quot;android.intent.action.MAIN&quot; /&gt;\n                &lt;category android:name=&quot;android.intent.category.LAUNCHER&quot; /&gt;\n            &lt;/intent-filter&gt;\n        &lt;/activity&gt;\n        &lt;activity android:name=&quot;.activity.SearchActivity&quot;\n            android:screenOrientation=&quot;portrait&quot;\n            android:exported=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;/activity&gt;\n        &lt;activity android:name=&quot;.activity.ControlActivity&quot;\n            android:screenOrientation=&quot;portrait&quot;\n            android:exported=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;/activity&gt;\n    &lt;/application&gt;\n\n&lt;/manifest&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","kubernetes","memcached"],"owner":{"account_id":3361684,"reputation":855,"user_id":2823355,"accept_rate":46,"display_name":"786543214"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1690686000,"creation_date":1690686000,"question_id":76796183,"body_markdown":"Facing memcached issue while running a application in K8 and memcached is running in docker.\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nEarlier we were in docker both application and memcached.
