The second option is to use `@Mock` instead of `@MockBean`, and call `@InjectMocks` in conjunction with the `MockitoExtension` for constructing the service under test:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)\r\npublic class CompteServiceImplTest {\r\n    @InjectMocks\r\n    private CompteService CompteService;\r\n    @Mock\r\n    private compteRepository compteRepository;\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could just call `MockitoAnnotations.initMocks()`, which will initialize the mocks annotated with `@Mock`, and use constructor injection for your service:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class CompteServiceImplTest {\r\n    private CompteService CompteService;\r\n\r\n    @Mock\r\n    private compteRepository compteRepository;\r\n\r\n    @BeforeEach\r\n    void setUp() {\r\n        MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this);\r\n        CompteService = new CompteServiceImpl(compteRepository, ...);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, you could do it all without annotations just by calling `Mockito.mock()` directly:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class CompteServiceImplTest {\r\n    private compteRepository compteRepository;\r\n\r\n    @BeforeEach\r\n    void setUp() {\r\n        compteRepository = Mockito.mock();\r\n        CompteService = new CompteServiceImpl(compteRepository, ...);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\n\r\nSince Mockito 3, the `MockitoAnnotations.initMocks()` has been deprecated in favour of `MockitoAnnotations.openMocks()`.

start\r\nSEVERE: Error listenerStart\r\n```\r\n\r\nIssues started around middle of January 2023 when tried to restart the server.\r\n\r\nSeems that issue is caused by the redirect (HTTP 302) from HTTP to HTTPS and application cannot process it.\r\nSo probably related to HTTPS redirect (newly done) by w3c.org. More details in:\r\n- https://www.w3.org/blog/2022/07/redirecting-to-https-on-www-w3-org/\r\n- https://www.w3.org/blog/2022/08/https-redirection-observations/\r\n\r\nRelated to the fact that app is using `@SchemaValidation` (com.sun.xml.ws.developer) and in the WSDL we have element with `type=&quot;xs:base64Binary&quot; xmime:expectedContentTypes=&quot;application/octet-stream&quot; xmlns:xmime=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2005/05/xmlmime&quot;` (due to the MTOM)\r\n\r\nApplication is using:\r\n- openjdk version &quot;1.8.0_362&quot; (Temurin)\r\n- Apache Tomcat 8.5.78\r\n- jaxws-ri 2.3.5\r\n\r\nWe were trying to use different JDK to try if there could be difference in SAX parser. But no luck.\r\n\r\nIs there please a way how to resolve it?

I am using spring data jpa 2.7.3 which includes hibernate 5.6.10 Final. It is interesting that when I change the parent version to 3.0.4 in the pom, this problem is solved.

On Windows there is no entry in &quot;Programs and Features&quot; because the installer does not register installations in the system registry.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to to locate Eclipse installations\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe default installation path is in `~/eclipse/`. \r\n\r\nThe Eclipse installer also keeps track of installations. Launch the installer and then open the &quot;Bundle Pool&quot; dialog (in simple mode it&#39;s in the menu - in advanced mode it&#39;s a small button next to the bundle pool drop down) and click on &quot;Analyze Agent&quot;. You&#39;ll see list of *profiles*. Double click on a profile to see the path of the installation.\r\n\r\nYou could also search for files that contain &quot;eclipse&quot; in their name with any file search tool to locate installation folders. But be aware that Eclipse is a platform that other software can build upon, so there might be folders of Eclipse-based applications that look very much like Eclipse IDE installations but are actually software you might want to keep.\r\n\r\nHow to quickly uninstall Eclipse\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you have installed Eclipse manually without the Eclipse installer, just delete the Eclipse directory and be done with it.\r\n\r\nIf you have installed Eclipse with the Eclipse installer, then delete the Eclipse directory and any desktop and start menu shortcuts. Then launch the Eclipse installer and open the &quot;Bundle Pool&quot; dialog and click on &quot;Cleanup Agent&quot; to remove unused bundles. This won&#39;t affect other Eclipse installations if you have any.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion this is generally enough and I would stop here\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to completely uninstall Eclipse\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you really want to remove Eclipse without leaving any traces, you have to manually delete\r\n\r\n- all desktop and start menu shortcuts\r\n- all installation directories (e.g. `~/eclipse/photon/`)\r\n- the p2 bundle pool (which is often shared with other eclipse installations)\r\n\r\nThe installer has a &quot;Bundle Pools&quot; menu entry which lists the locations of all bundle pools. If you have other Eclipse installations on your system you can use the &quot;Cleanup Agent&quot; to remove unused bundles. If you don&#39;t have any other Eclipse installations you can delete the whole bundle pool directory instead (by default `~/p2/`).\r\n\r\nIf you want to completely remove the *Eclipse installer* too, delete the installer&#39;s executable and the `~/.eclipse/` directory.\r\n\r\nDepending on what kind of work you did with Eclipse, there can be more directories that you may want to delete. If you used Maven, then `~/.m2/` contains the Maven cache and settings (shared with Maven CLI and other IDEs). If you develop Eclipse plugins, then there might be JUnit workspaces from test runs, next to you Eclipse workspace.

Just be aware that registry &quot;cleaning&quot; is a controversial topic. \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1079348/\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/54948948/897024","title":"How to uninstall Eclipse?","body":"<p>There is no automated uninstaller.</p>\n<p>You have to remove Eclipse manually by deleting some directories and files.</p>\n<p><em>Note: I use Unix style paths in this answer but the locations should be the same on Windows or Unix systems, so <code>~</code> refers to the user home directory even on Windows.</em></p>\n<h2>Why is there no uninstaller?</h2>\n<p>According to this <a href=\"https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1079348/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">discussion about uninstalling Eclipse</a>, the reasoning for not providing an uninstaller is that the Eclipse installer is supposed to just automate a few tasks that in the past had to be done manually (like downloading and extracting Eclipse and adding shortcuts), so they also can be undone manually. On Windows there is no entry in &quot;Programs and Features&quot; because the installer does not register installations in the system registry.</p>\n<h2>How to to locate Eclipse installations</h2>\n<p>The default installation path is in <code>~/eclipse/</code>.</p>\n<p>The Eclipse installer also keeps track of installations. Launch the installer and then open the &quot;Bundle Pool&quot; dialog (in simple mode it's in the menu - in advanced mode it's a small button next to the bundle pool drop down) and click on &quot;Analyze Agent&quot;. You'll see list of <em>profiles</em>. Double click on a profile to see the path of the installation.</p>\n<p>You could also search for files that contain &quot;eclipse&quot; in their name with any file search tool to locate installation folders. But be aware that Eclipse is a platform that other software can build upon, so there might be folders of Eclipse-based applications that look very much like Eclipse IDE installations but are actually software you might want to keep.</p>\n<h2>How to quickly uninstall Eclipse</h2>\n<p>If you have installed Eclipse manually without the Eclipse installer, just delete the Eclipse directory and be done with it.</p>\n<p>If you have installed Eclipse with the Eclipse installer, then delete the Eclipse directory and any desktop and start menu shortcuts. Then launch the Eclipse installer and open the &quot;Bundle Pool&quot; dialog and click on &quot;Cleanup Agent&quot; to remove unused bundles. This won't affect other Eclipse installations if you have any.</p>\n<p>In my opinion this is generally enough and I would stop here</p>\n<h2>How to completely uninstall Eclipse</h2>\n<p>If you really want to remove Eclipse without leaving any traces, you have to manually delete</p>\n<ul>\n<li>all desktop and start menu shortcuts</li>\n<li>all installation directories (e.g. <code>~/eclipse/photon/</code>)</li>\n<li>the p2 bundle pool (which is often shared with other eclipse installations)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The installer has a &quot;Bundle Pools&quot; menu entry which lists the locations of all bundle pools. If you have other Eclipse installations on your system you can use the &quot;Cleanup Agent&quot; to remove unused bundles. If you don't have any other Eclipse installations you can delete the whole bundle pool directory instead (by default <code>~/p2/</code>).</p>\n<p>If you want to completely remove the <em>Eclipse installer</em> too, delete the installer's executable and the <code>~/.eclipse/</code> directory.</p>\n<p>Depending on what kind of work you did with Eclipse, there can be more directories that you may want to delete. If you used Maven, then <code>~/.m2/</code> contains the Maven cache and settings (shared with Maven CLI and other IDEs). If you develop Eclipse plugins, then there might be JUnit workspaces from test runs, next to you Eclipse workspace. Likewise other build tools and development environments used in Eclipse could have created similar directories.</p>\n<h2>How to delete all projects</h2>\n<p>If you want to delete your projects and workspace metadata, you have to delete your workspace(s). The default workspace location is ´~/workspace/´. You can also <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/54948948/897024\">search for the <code>.metadata</code> directory to get all Eclipse workspaces on your machine</a>.</p>\n<p>If you are working with Git projects, these are generally not saved in the workspace but in the <code>~/git/</code> directory.</p>\n<h2>Addendum: Windows Registry</h2>\n<p>Even though Eclipse isn't &quot;installed&quot; like a regular Windows application, there are still a few entries that get written to the system registry.
