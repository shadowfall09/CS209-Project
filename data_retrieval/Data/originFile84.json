As a 16-bit value, `char` is physically incapable of representing most characters. \r\n\r\nInstead, use [code point][1] integer numbers. \r\n\r\nAs an alternative to [concatenating][2] via the `+` (PLUS SIGN) operator, you may choose to call [`String#concat`][3].

Adding a parent project is a bit more work and requires you to follow some of the steps outlined in the rest of this answer.\r\n\r\n**Java modules and Maven modules are different**\r\n\r\n[Java modules][1] and Maven modules are completely different things.  You must understand that.  Maven modules handle the build time modularity of the project and Java modules the runtime modularity.\r\n\r\nYou can use one or the other, both, or neither.  You can set up projects where you create Maven modules 1:1 with Java modules, but it is not a requirement to do it that way.\r\n\r\n * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64866180/difference-between-multi-module-pom-and-java-module-system (the answer here is excellent and recommended reading).\r\n\r\n**Discussion on Java Modules**\r\n\r\nUnlike Maven dependencies, *java modules enforce and reduce visibility*.  This requires you to do extra work to define the visible interfaces to a module.  That work is unnecessary if Java modules are not used.  \r\n\r\nJava modules can provide benefits in terms of reducing complexity and security surfaces in an application, allowing tool-based dependency analysis (e.g. via the jdeps tool and graphviz) and building custom runtimes for applications using jlink or jpackage.\r\n\r\nA major issue with Java modules is that a lot of important software you might depend on is not fully modularized (does not provide a module-info definition).  That greatly reduces the benefit that Java modularity can provide and also increases the complexity in creating and delivering a modularized project that also makes use of non-modular software.\r\n\r\nIf the java module definition (module-info.java) does not open or export a package from the module, the code in the module *cannot be used outside the module*. \r\n\r\nWhile this is a simple concept (and one of the main purposes of modularity).  It is a concept unfamiliar to many Java developers not used to working with a module system because Java traditionally hasn&#39;t worked that way - if the code was available somewhere on the classpath, it could be used both via direct API calls and through reflection, but this is simply not the case once the code has been modularized using java modules.\r\n\r\n**Discussion on Maven Modules**\r\n\r\nThe best practice for Maven is to have a single primary artifact (e.g. jar file) created for a project.  Sometimes this is a bit restrictive and you might want to output multiple artifacts (e.g. output multiple jar files from a build).  In this case, the recommended approach is to create multiple Maven modules and have a parent project that references each of the child modules.\r\n\r\nEach module can then act like its own project and output a primary build artifact (single jar file).  Upstream build modules can depend on the artifacts built by other modules and make use of them if necessary.\r\n\r\n**Maven module guides to follow**\r\n\r\nRequired reading:\r\n\r\n * [Maven multi-module project documentation][2] \r\n * and [tutorials][3] \r\n * as well as info on working with [multi-module projects in your IDE][4]. \r\n\r\nThe best practice is to provide [CI-friendly versions for multi-module projects][5], though whether to follow that is up to you.\r\n\r\n**Advice on modularization**\r\n\r\nOne consideration you should have is why you are modularizing your project.  For the SceneBuilder project you reference, the modularity is there so that tool providers (such as IDE builders) can use the Scene Builder kit module to provide the functionality of Scene Builder embedded in their IDE, rather than as a standalone application (as is provided by the SceneBuilder app module that relies on the kit for its implementation).  Your reason for introducing modularity will likely be different, but you should be able to reasonably articulate it to somebody who may ask.\r\n\r\nI would caution against introducing many modules to a project, as it can make the project more difficult to work with.  For instance, if you [look at the core JavaFX system][6] (which is huge), it consists of seven modules in total, each with a well-defined reason for existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy advice is:\r\n\r\n 1. Use maven modules for large complex projects in cases where it makes sense (e.g. a multi-tier app with a module for the front-end UI and a module for the back-end server).  \r\n 2. Use Java modules for projects that depend only on modular dependencies (those that include module-info) and probably skip creating Java modules if that is not the case.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.oracle.com/corporate/features/understanding-java-9-modules.html\r\n  [2]: https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-modules-4.html\r\n  [3]: https://www.baeldung.com/maven-multi-module\r\n  [4]: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/guide/tutorials/marco-codes-maven/multi-module-projects/\r\n  [5]: https://maven.apache.org/maven-ci-friendly.html\r\n  [6]: https://openjfx.io/javadoc/21/","title":"JavaFX complex project architecture","body":"<p>This guide is for multi-module projects with Maven, you can achieve something similar with other build tools such as Gradle or your IDE, but that is not in scope here.

Is it really a genuine instance of your mobile app, or is it a bot, an automated script or an attacker manually poking around your API server with a tool like Postman?\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;The **who** is the user of the mobile app that we can authenticate, authorize and identify in several ways, like using OpenID Connect or OAUTH2 flows.\r\n\r\nSo if the quoted text is not enough to clarify you, then please go ahead and read the entire section of the article.\r\n\r\n## Impersonating the Mobile App\r\n\r\n&gt; In those request I&#39;ve found a lot of auth keys that I can use in other calls from a console, simulating the app with no problems.\r\n\r\nIf by `auth keys` you mean the ones provide via user sign-in, with his username and password, then they just identify the **who** in the request.\r\n\r\nFor other keys, like `api-keys`, `access-tokens`, or any other convention used to name them, they have the purpose of providing to the API server a mechanism to only authorize requests from the genuine mobile app, they are indeed trying to allow the API server to identify **what** is doing the request, and has you already discovered it&#39;s easy to extract them with a proxy:\r\n\r\n&gt; Although you use SSL, it&#39;s &quot;usually easy&quot; to hack mobile apps (I&#39;m thinking in Android right now: decompiling the app, changing manifest to allow custom SSL, compiling again and sniffing through a SSL proxy all the requests).\r\n\r\nSo, in the end of the day all an attacker needs it&#39;s to use a proxy to learn how the API server works, and what is needed to simulate an API call as if it was done from the mobile app itself.\r\n\r\n## Hardening and Shielding the Mobile App\r\n\r\n&gt; So, now I&#39;ve hacked some API&#39;s in mobile apps, my question is: is there any way to secure an API in a mobile app?\r\n\r\nYou can use Mobile Hardening and Shielding solutions, that will try to prevent the mobile app to work in compromised/rooted devices, with modified/tampered apps and/or when some instrumentation framework is being used during runtime, but all of them have the draw-back of performing all that decisions in the mobile app, therefore subject to be manipulated or totally bypassed by the alreay dito instrumentation frameworks, and a good example of one it&#39;s [Frida](https://frida.re):\r\n\r\n&gt; Inject your own scripts into black box processes. Hook any function, spy on crypto APIs or trace private application code, no source code needed. Edit, hit save, and instantly see the results. All without compilation steps or program restarts. \r\n\r\nWhile is better to use an in app solution, than not using anything, it&#39;s still not the ideal solution, because the control of deciding what to do is in the client side, not in the server side, thus the attacker can resort to use Frida to introspect the code at runtime and learn how to impersonate the mobile app.\r\n\r\n## Securing the API Server\r\n\r\n## The Basic API Security Defenses\r\n\r\nNow that you understand the difference between **who** vs **what** is accessing your API server and you know that an attacker can learn how to impersonate your genuine mobile app you may want to go an read [my article](https://dev.to/exadra37/the-top-6-mobile-api-protection-techniques-are-they-enough-3mhn) about the basic techniques to secure an API:\r\n\r\n&gt; In this article we will explore the most common techniques used to protect an API, including how important it is to use HTTPS to protect the communication channel between mobile app and API, how API keys are used to identify the mobile app on each API request, how user agents, captchas and IP addresses are used for bot mitigation, and finally how user authentication is important for the mobile security and api security. We will discuss each of these techniques and discuss how they impact the business risk profile, i.e. how easy they are get around.\r\n\r\nThis is only a very basic technique that the majority of APIs may already employ, but they can be reinforced with some more advanced techniques.\r\n\r\n## More Advanced API Security Defenses\r\n\r\nYou can start to read this series of articles on [Mobile API Security Techniques](https://blog.approov.io/tag/a-series-mobile-api-security) to understand how API keys, HMAC, OAUTH and [certificate pinning](https://blog.approov.io/securing-https-with-certificate-pinning-on-android) can be used to enhance the security and at same time learn how they can be abused/defeated.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, and depending on your budget and resources you may employ an array of different approaches and techniques to defend your API server, and I will start to enumerate some of the most usual ones.\r\n\r\nYou can start with [reCaptcha V3](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html), followed by [Web Application Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall)(WAF) and finally if you can afford it a [User Behavior Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_behavior_analytics)(UBA) solution.\r\n\r\nGoogle [reCAPTCHA V3](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html):\r\n\r\n&gt; reCAPTCHA is a free service that protects your website from spam and abuse. reCAPTCHA uses an advanced risk analysis engine and adaptive challenges to keep automated software from engaging in abusive activities on your site. It does this while letting your valid users pass through with ease.\r\n\r\n&gt; ...helps you detect abusive traffic on your website without any user friction. It returns a score based on the interactions with your website and provides you more flexibility to take appropriate actions.\r\n\r\n[WAF - Web Application Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall):\r\n\r\n&gt; A web application firewall (or WAF) filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web application. A WAF is differentiated from a regular firewall in that a WAF is able to filter the content of specific web applications while regular firewalls serve as a safety gate between servers. By inspecting HTTP traffic, it can prevent attacks stemming from web application security flaws, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and security misconfigurations.\r\n\r\n[UBA - User Behavior Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_behavior_analytics):\r\n\r\n&gt; User behavior analytics (UBA) as defined by Gartner is a cybersecurity process about detection of insider threats, targeted attacks, and financial fraud. UBA solutions look at patterns of human behavior, and then apply algorithms and statistical analysis to detect meaningful anomalies from those patterns—anomalies that indicate potential threats. Instead of tracking devices or security events, UBA tracks a system&#39;s users. Big data platforms like Apache Hadoop are increasing UBA functionality by allowing them to analyze petabytes worth of data to detect insider threats and advanced persistent threats.\r\n\r\nAll this solutions work based on a negative identification model, by other words, they try their best to differentiate the bad from the good by identifying what is bad, not what is good, thus they are prone to false positives, despite of the advanced technology used by some of them, like machine learning and artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nSo, you may find yourself more often than not in having to relax how you block the access to the API server in order to not affect the good users. This also means that this solutions require constant monitoring to validate that the false positives are not blocking your legit users and that at same time they are properly keeping at bay the unauthorized ones.\r\n\r\nRegarding APIs serving mobile apps a positive identification model can be used by implementing a Mobile App Attestation solution that attests the integrity of your mobile app and device its running on before any request is made to the API server.\r\n\r\n## A Possible Better Solution\r\n\r\nThe current implementations of a mobile app and API server may look like this:\r\n\r\n![API direct access from a Mobile App](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bIgVU.png)\r\n \r\nThis approach is what leaves the API keys vulnerable to be extracted by attackers via proxy interception(red line), just like you already noticed by using a proxy to intercept them.\r\n\r\nA better approach would be something like this:\r\n\r\n![No API Key in a mobile app](https://i.stack.imgur.com/v2OfU.png)\r\n\r\nWait, but I don&#39;t see any API key in the mobile app anymore:\r\n\r\n&gt; Am I missing something ?\r\n\r\nYes, a Mobile App Attestation solution.\r\n\r\nTo be in a position where you don&#39;t need to ship any secrets with your mobile app, then you need to resort to the Mobile App Attestation concept, and from [this article section](https://blog.approov.io/how-to-protect-against-certificate-pinning-bypassing#mobile-app-attestation) I will quote the relevant parts to explain it&#39;s role:\r\n\r\n&gt;The role of a Mobile App Attestation service is to authenticate **what** is sending the requests, thus only responding to requests coming from genuine mobile app instances and rejecting all other requests from unauthorized sources.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;In order to know **what** is sending the requests to the API server, a Mobile App Attestation service, at run-time, will identify with high confidence that your mobile app is present, has not been tampered/repackaged, is not running in a rooted device, has not been hooked into by an instrumentation framework(Frida, xPosed, Cydia, etc.), and is not the object of a [Man in the Middle Attack (MitM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack). This is achieved by running an SDK in the background that will communicate with a service running in the cloud to attest the integrity of the mobile app and device it is running on.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;On a successful attestation of the mobile app integrity, a short time lived [JWT token](https://jwt.io/introduction/) is issued and signed with a secret that only the API server and the Mobile App Attestation service in the cloud know. In the case that attestation fails the JWT token is signed with an incorrect secret. Since the secret used by the Mobile App Attestation service is not known by the mobile app, it is not possible to reverse engineer it at run-time even when the app has been tampered with, is running in a rooted device or communicating over a connection that is the target of a MitM attack.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;The mobile app must send the JWT token in the header of every API request. This allows the API server to only serve requests when it can verify that the JWT token was signed with the shared secret and that it has not expired. All other requests will be refused. In other words a valid JWT token tells the API server that **what** is making the request is the genuine mobile app uploaded to the Google or Apple store, while an invalid or missing JWT token means that **what** is making the request is not authorized to do so, because it may be a bot, a repackaged app or an attacker making a MitM attack.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;A great benefit of using a Mobile App Attestation service is its proactive and positive authentication model, which does not create false positives, and thus does not block legitimate users while it keeps the bad guys at bay.\r\n\r\nThe Mobile App Attestation releases your mobile app from having an embedded secret in its code, instead now it only needs to pass to the reverse proxy or backend the JWT token it receives from the mobile app attestation service. Now the reverse proxy or backend can verify the JWT token, and on successful validation they can accept requests with a very high confidence that they are originated from **what** they expect, a true and genuine instance of the mobile app, with the added benefit of not **exposing** the API keys to access your API server or any Third Party services.\r\n\r\n## GOING THE EXTRA MILE\r\n\r\nI cannot finish without recommending you the excellent work done by the OWASP foundation. \r\n\r\n### For Mobile Apps\r\n\r\n[OWASP - Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg):\r\n\r\n&gt; The Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG) is a comprehensive manual for mobile app security development, testing and reverse engineering. \r\n\r\n### For APIS\r\n\r\n[OWASP API Security Top 10](https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security)\r\n\r\n&gt; The OWASP API Security Project seeks to provide value to software developers and security assessors by underscoring the potential risks in insecure APIs, and illustrating how these risks may be mitigated. In order to facilitate this goal, the OWASP API Security Project will create and maintain a Top 10 API Security Risks document, as well as a documentation portal for best practices when creating or assessing APIs.\r\n","title":"How to secure an API REST for mobile app? (if sniffing requests gives you the &quot;key&quot;)","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>Am I wrong?\nIs this a stupid question?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No you are not wrong, and it's not a stupid question at all, because it's indeed easy to attack an API server of a mobile app, and you will be surprised to know how many senior developers are not aware how easy it can be done, and I have noticed that more often then not, this is due to their misconception about <strong>what</strong> vs <strong>who</strong> is accessing the API server.</p>\n<h2>The difference between <strong>what</strong> and <strong>who</strong> is accessing the API server.</h2>\n<p>This is discussed in more detail in <a href=\"https://blog.approov.io/why-does-your-mobile-app-need-an-api-key#api-who-vs-what\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this article</a> I wrote, where we can read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>what</strong> is the thing making the request to the API server.

The reason is, there is no definition about the stack trace in the ECMA Script definition (not even in  [ES9 / ES2019)][2]). So some engines implement their own idea of an stack trace and its representation.\r\n\r\nMany of them have implemented the `Error.prototype.stack` property which is a string representation of the stack trace. Since this is not defined you can not rely on the string format. Luckily the V8 engine is quite common (Google Chrome and NodeJS) which gives us a chance to at least try to.\r\n\r\nA good thing about the V8 (and the applications using it) is that the Stack trace has a common format:\r\n\r\n    /path/to/file/script.js:11\r\n            throw new Error(&quot;Some new Message&quot;, e);\r\n            ^\r\n\r\n    Error: Some new Message\r\n        at testOtherFnc (/path/to/file/script.js:69:15)\r\n        at Object.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/path/to/file/script.js:73:1)\r\n        at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:688:30)\r\n        at Object.Module._extensions..js (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:699:10)\r\n        at Module.load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:598:32)\r\n        at tryModuleLoad (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:537:12)\r\n        at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:529:3)\r\n        at Function.Module.runMain (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:741:12)\r\n        at startup (internal/bootstrap/node.js:285:19)\r\n        at bootstrapNodeJSCore (internal/bootstrap/node.js:739:3)\r\n\r\n**...and the stack trace is not parsed and styled in the console.**\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich gives us a good opportunity to chain them (or at least change the output generated of the error).\r\n\r\nA quite easy way to do this would be something like this:\r\n\r\n    let ff = v =&gt; JSON.stringify(v, undefined, 4);\r\n    const formatForOutput = v =&gt; {\r\n        try {\r\n            return ff(v).replace(/\\n/g, &#39;\\n    &#39;);\r\n        } catch (e) {\r\n            return &quot;&quot; + v;\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    const chainErrors = exporting.chainErrors = (e1, e2) =&gt; {\r\n        if (e1 instanceof Error)\r\n            e2.stack += &#39;\\nCaused by: &#39; + e1.stack;\r\n        else\r\n            e2.stack += &#39;\\nWas caused by throwing:\\n    &#39; + formatForOutput(e1);\r\n\r\n        return e2;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhich you could use like this:\r\n\r\n    function someErrorThrowingFunction() {\r\n        throw new Error(&quot;Some Message&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function testOtherFnc() {\r\n        try {\r\n            someErrorThrowingFunction();\r\n        } catch (e) {\r\n            throw chainErrors(e, new Error(&quot;Some new Message&quot;));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhich produces:\r\n\r\n    /path/to/file/script.js:11\r\n            throw new Error(&quot;Some new Message&quot;, e);\r\n            ^\r\n\r\n    Error: Some new Message\r\n        at testOtherFnc (/path/to/file/script.js:11:15)\r\n        at Object.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/path/to/file/script.js:15:1)\r\n        at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:688:30)\r\n        at Object.Module._extensions..js (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:699:10)\r\n        at Module.load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:598:32)\r\n        at tryModuleLoad (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:537:12)\r\n        at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:529:3)\r\n        at Function.Module.runMain (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:741:12)\r\n        at startup (internal/bootstrap/node.js:285:19)\r\n        at bootstrapNodeJSCore (internal/bootstrap/node.js:739:3)\r\n    Caused by: Error: Some Message\r\n        at someErrorThrowingFunction (/path/to/file/script.js:4:11)\r\n        at testOtherFnc (/path/to/file/script.js:9:9)\r\n        at Object.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/path/to/file/script.js:15:1)\r\n        at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:688:30)\r\n        at Object.Module._extensions..js (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:699:10)\r\n        at Module.load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:598:32)\r\n        at tryModuleLoad (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:537:12)\r\n        at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:529:3)\r\n        at Function.Module.runMain (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:741:12)\r\n        at startup (internal/bootstrap/node.js:285:19)\r\n\r\nWhich is pretty similar to the stack trace generated by Java.\r\nThere are three problems with this. \r\n\r\nThe first problem is the duplication of the call sites, which is solveable but complicated.\r\n\r\nThe second is that the output generated is engine dependent, this attempt works quite well for V8 but is not usable for Firefox for example, since Firefox not just uses another style but they also parse and style the error massage which prevents us from chaining it like this.\r\n\r\nThe third problem is usability.

If at all possible, you should do it that way.\r\n\r\nBut your question seems to indicate that you can’t, so…\r\n\r\nThe first problem is that URLs have a limited set of characters they are allowed to contain.  A URL is *not* allowed to contain a backslash character.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this line is incorrect:\r\n\r\n    URL jarURL = new URL(&quot;file:&quot; + &quot;C:\\\\Users\\\\Test\\\\Downloads\\\\javax.activation-1.2.0.jar&quot;);\r\n\r\nWhy didn’t it throw an exception?  Because java.net.URL is a very old class.  It was part of Java 1.0.  It didn’t do rigorous checking of syntax.\r\n\r\nWhy didn’t they fix it?  Because in object-oriented design, you *never* break existing code that utilizes public classes and public class members.  So, instead, Java added a new class, [java.net.URI](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URI.html), which *does* do rigorous syntax checking.  This code would throw an exception, as it should:\r\n\r\n    URI uri = new URI(&quot;file:&quot; + &quot;C:\\\\Users\\\\Test\\\\Downloads\\\\javax.activation-1.2.0.jar&quot;);\r\n\r\nThe proper way to convert a file name to a URL is:\r\n\r\n    Path path = Path.of(&quot;C:\\\\Users\\\\Test\\\\Downloads\\\\javax.activation-1.2.0.jar&quot;);\r\n    assert Files.isReadable(path) : &quot;File \\&quot;&quot; + path + &quot;\\&quot; does not exist!&quot;;\r\n\r\n    URL activationJarURL = path.toUri().toURL();\r\n\r\nThe second problem is that Java doesn’t use a thread’s context classloader.

If at all possible, you should do it that way.</p>\n<p>But your question seems to indicate that you can’t, so…</p>\n<p>The first problem is that URLs have a limited set of characters they are allowed to contain.  A URL is <em>not</em> allowed to contain a backslash character.</p>\n<p>Therefore, this line is incorrect:</p>\n<pre><code>URL jarURL = new URL(&quot;file:&quot; + &quot;C:\\\\Users\\\\Test\\\\Downloads\\\\javax.activation-1.2.0.jar&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Why didn’t it throw an exception?  Because java.net.URL is a very old class.  It was part of Java 1.0.  It didn’t do rigorous checking of syntax.</p>\n<p>Why didn’t they fix it?  Because in object-oriented design, you <em>never</em> break existing code that utilizes public classes and public class members.

From SourceForge it looks like the patch was last updated in 2012. \r\n\r\nIs there some way to skip Category labels in 1.0.16 or 1.0.17?

JFree Bar Chart","body":"<p>I have a bar chart with one 'series' (in jfree paralance) called 'Brutto' and many categories; one for each month since 2008. I've rotated the month labels UP-90 but they are all squished together and hard to read so I'd like to skip some of them (for example every other one or every third one but it doesn't really matter as long as it's neat and readable and preferably dynamic for future additions).</p>\n\n<p>I am using JfreeChart 1.0.16 and I thought I had discovered the answer when I came across Ray Lukas' patch on SourceForge and the related post on the jfree forum: <a href=\"http://www.jfree.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=15345&amp;start=15\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.jfree.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=15345&amp;start=15</a></p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately this patch/class doesn't appear to work with 1.0.16; I've tried the demo code as well as adapting the demo for my use case and while it doesn't throw any errors it also appears to do absolutely nothing to my chart. From SourceForge it looks like the patch was last updated in 2012. </p>\n\n<p>Is there some way to skip Category labels in 1.0.16 or 1.0.17? If not, is there a work around or a way to update Ray's patch to work with 1.0.16?</p>\n\n<p>I've paid for the JFree dev guide and demo source but haven't seen anything useful there - let me know if I missed something in there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>For code to play with you can use Ray's demo code with a dataset more similar to mine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class CategoryLabelDemo extends ApplicationFrame {\n\n/**\n * Creates a new demo instance.\n *\n * @param title  the frame title.\n */\npublic CategoryLabelDemo(String title) {\n    super(title);\n    DefaultCategoryDataset dataset = new DefaultCategoryDataset();\n    dataset.addValue(-0.0023, value, Jun 2008);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0039089907, value, Jul 2008);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0035218354, value, Aug 2008);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0092901141, value, Sep 2008);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0245642646, value, Okt 2008);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0032392894, value, Nov 2008);\ndataset.addValue(0.0024111542, value, Dez 2008);\ndataset.addValue(0.0062748379, value, Jan 2009);\ndataset.addValue(0.0107046352, value, Feb 2009);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0101799486, value, Mrz 2009);\ndataset.addValue(6.233119E-4, value, Apr 2009);\ndataset.addValue(0.0117317276, value, Mai 2009);\ndataset.addValue(0.0069779374, value, Jun 2009);\ndataset.addValue(0.0132477326, value, Jul 2009);\ndataset.addValue(0.0062355426, value, Aug 2009);\ndataset.addValue(0.0181909045, value, Sep 2009);\ndataset.addValue(0.0049082164, value, Okt 2009);\ndataset.addValue(0.0186578099, value, Nov 2009);\ndataset.addValue(0.0059455313, value, Dez 2009);\ndataset.addValue(8.5796E-4, value, Jan 2010);\ndataset.addValue(0.0048576055, value, Feb 2010);\ndataset.addValue(0.0230331754, value, Mrz 2010);\ndataset.addValue(0.0128787177, value, Apr 2010);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0101536773, value, Mai 2010);\ndataset.addValue(0.0017558451, value, Jun 2010);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0010147601, value, Jul 2010);\ndataset.addValue(0.0093268076, value, Aug 2010);\ndataset.addValue(0.0082342177, value, Sep 2010);\ndataset.addValue(0.0078039927, value, Okt 2010);\ndataset.addValue(7.203314E-4, value, Nov 2010);\ndataset.addValue(0.0071081519, value, Dez 2010);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0108996694, value, Jan 2011);\ndataset.addValue(0.0059615211, value, Feb 2011);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0045793302, value, Mrz 2011);\ndataset.addValue(0.0128991521, value, Apr 2011);\ndataset.addValue(0.0040074806, value, Mai 2011);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0117083555, value, Jun 2011);\ndataset.addValue(0.0096033028, value, Jul 2011);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0115565828, value, Aug 2011);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0178972929, value, Sep 2011);\ndataset.addValue(0.0091575092, value, Okt 2011);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0153357532, value, Nov 2011);\ndataset.addValue(0.0110588886, value, Dez 2011);\ndataset.addValue(0.0148573512, value, Jan 2012);\ndataset.addValue(0.0104185378, value, Feb 2012);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0038222222, value, Mrz 2012);\ndataset.addValue(0.0026768984, value, Apr 2012);\ndataset.addValue(-0.006763371, value, Mai 2012);\ndataset.addValue(8.063794E-4, value, Jun 2012);\ndataset.addValue(0.0189794091, value, Jul 2012);\ndataset.addValue(7.028642E-4, value, Aug 2012);\ndataset.addValue(0.0049165935, value, Sep 2012);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0038441377, value, Okt 2012);\ndataset.addValue(0.0055253464, value, Nov 2012);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0018316616, value, Dez 2012);\ndataset.addValue(0.0015728766, value, Jan 2013);\ndataset.addValue(0.0035770372, value, Feb 2013);\ndataset.addValue(0.0103451274, value, Mrz 2013);\ndataset.addValue(-7.743934E-4, value, Apr 2013);\ndataset.addValue(0.0051666236, value, Mai 2013);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0231303007, value, Jun 2013);\ndataset.addValue(0.0109620275, value, Jul 2013);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0020818876, value, Aug 2013);\ndataset.addValue(0.0067802503, value, Sep 2013);\ndataset.addValue(0.0087204283, value, Okt 2013);\ndataset.addValue(0.0053924506, value, Nov 2013);\ndataset.addValue(-0.0103865146, value, Dez 2013);\n    JFreeChart chart = createChart(dataset);\n    ChartPanel chartPanel = new ChartPanel(chart);\n    chartPanel.setPreferredSize(new java.awt.Dimension(500, 270));\n\n    setContentPane(chartPanel);\n\n}\n\n/**\n * Creates a chart.\n * \n * @param dataset  the dataset.\n * \n * @return A chart.\n */\nprivate static JFreeChart createChart(CategoryDataset dataset) {\n\n    JFreeChart chart = null;\n    try {\n        BarRenderer barRenderer = new BarRenderer();\n        CategoryAxis customCategoryAxis = new CategoryAxisSkipLabels();

I wanted the largest areas of the chart to have large contrast, and I was ok with some small areas to have colours similar to those from top 10, as it was obvious for the reader which one is which one by just observing the area.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1197724,"reputation":4402,"user_id":1169091,"accept_rate":9,"display_name":"nicomp"},"score":0,"creation_date":1672083524,"post_id":9701141,"comment_id":132218859,"body_markdown":"My generation thanks you.","body":"My generation thanks you."}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":66096,"reputation":3558,"user_id":194106,"accept_rate":89,"display_name":"Uri Cohen"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":41,"is_accepted":false,"score":41,"last_activity_date":1331724780,"creation_date":1331724780,"answer_id":9701141,"question_id":470690,"body_markdown":"For the sake of generations to come I add here the accepted answer in Python.\r\n\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    import colorsys\r\n\r\n    def _get_colors(num_colors):\r\n        colors=[]\r\n        for i in np.arange(0., 360., 360. / num_colors):\r\n            hue = i/360.\r\n            lightness = (50 + np.random.rand() * 10)/100.\r\n            saturation = (90 + np.random.rand() * 10)/100.\r\n            colors.append(colorsys.hls_to_rgb(hue, lightness, saturation))\r\n        return colors\r\n","title":"How to automatically generate N &quot;distinct&quot; colors?","body":"<p>For the sake of generations to come I add here the accepted answer in Python.</p>\n\n<pre><code>import numpy as np\nimport colorsys\n\ndef _get_colors(num_colors):\n    colors=[]\n    for i in np.arange(0., 360., 360. / num_colors):\n        hue = i/360.\n        lightness = (50 + np.random.rand() * 10)/100.\n        saturation = (90 + np.random.rand() * 10)/100.\n        colors.append(colorsys.hls_to_rgb(hue, lightness, saturation))\n    return colors\n</code></pre>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1727141,"reputation":1174,"user_id":1581558,"accept_rate":81,"display_name":"Gyfis"},"score":8,"creation_date":1475351394,"post_id":13781114,"comment_id":66913062,"body_markdown":"The amount of lambdas is too damn high.

The method is O(n^3) but that doesn&#39;t matter for small numbers or ones that can be cached. It can certainly be made more efficient but the results appear to be excellent.\r\n\r\nThe function allows for optional specification of brightness thresholds so as not to produce colors in which no component is brighter or darker than given amounts. IE you may not want values close to black or white.

Distances in YUV represent differences in human perception. I needed this functionality for MagicCube4D which implements 4-dimensional Rubik's cubes and an unlimited numbers of other 4D twisty puzzles having arbitrary numbers of faces. </p>\n\n<p>My solution starts by selecting random points in YUV and then iteratively breaking up the closest two points, and only converting to RGB when returning the result. The method is O(n^3) but that doesn't matter for small numbers or ones that can be cached. It can certainly be made more efficient but the results appear to be excellent.</p>\n\n<p>The function allows for optional specification of brightness thresholds so as not to produce colors in which no component is brighter or darker than given amounts. IE you may not want values close to black or white. This is useful when the resulting colors will be used as base colors that are later shaded via lighting, layering, transparency, etc. and must still appear different from their base colors.</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.awt.Color;\nimport java.util.Random;\n\n/**\n * Contains a method to generate N visually distinct colors and helper methods.\n * \n * @author Melinda Green\n */\npublic class ColorUtils {\n    private ColorUtils() {} // To disallow instantiation.\n    private final static float\n        U_OFF = .436f,\n        V_OFF = .615f;\n    private static final long RAND_SEED = 0;\n    private static Random rand = new Random(RAND_SEED);    \n\n    /*\n     * Returns an array of ncolors RGB triplets such that each is as unique from the rest as possible\n     * and each color has at least one component greater than minComponent and one less than maxComponent.\n     * Use min == 1 and max == 0 to include the full RGB color range.\n     * \n     * Warning: O N^2 algorithm blows up fast for more than 100 colors.\n     */\n    public static Color[] generateVisuallyDistinctColors(int ncolors, float minComponent, float maxComponent) {\n        rand.setSeed(RAND_SEED); // So that we get consistent results for each combination of inputs\n\n        float[][] yuv = new float[ncolors][3];\n\n        // initialize array with random colors\n        for(int got = 0; got &lt; ncolors;) {\n            System.arraycopy(randYUVinRGBRange(minComponent, maxComponent), 0, yuv[got++], 0, 3);\n        }\n        // continually break up the worst-fit color pair until we get tired of searching\n        for(int c = 0; c &lt; ncolors * 1000; c++) {\n            float worst = 8888;\n            int worstID = 0;\n            for(int i = 1; i &lt; yuv.length; i++) {\n                for(int j = 0; j &lt; i; j++) {\n                    float dist = sqrdist(yuv[i], yuv[j]);\n                    if(dist &lt; worst) {\n                        worst = dist;\n                        worstID = i;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            float[] best = randYUVBetterThan(worst, minComponent, maxComponent, yuv);\n            if(best == null)\n                break;\n            else\n                yuv[worstID] = best;\n        }\n\n        Color[] rgbs = new Color[yuv.length];\n        for(int i = 0; i &lt; yuv.length; i++) {\n            float[] rgb = new float[3];\n            yuv2rgb(yuv[i][0], yuv[i][1], yuv[i][2], rgb);\n            rgbs[i] = new Color(rgb[0], rgb[1], rgb[2]);\n            //System.out.println(rgb[i][0] + \"\\t\" + rgb[i][1] + \"\\t\" + rgb[i][2]);\n        }\n\n        return rgbs;\n    }\n\n    public static void hsv2rgb(float h, float s, float v, float[] rgb) {\n        // H is given on [0-&gt;6] or -1.

CANCEL /       OK</p>\n<p>Without clicking on anything, launch the app – the volume is at 100%</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that the very fact that this warning was displayed, allows the app to set the volume to 100%</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 3</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Restart the device, launch the app – volume is at 20%</p>\n<p>Play the first track.</p>\n<p>When the track ends, and the second track is started, the volume goes\nto 100%</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that setting the volume to 100% can be done at a later stage?</p>\n<p>I realise that I haven’t included the whole project here.\nAlso, initially I had included the above Java code just in one place – on the main activity’s OnCreate().\nI then kept adding in more and more places, trying to see if it would ever take effect.</p>\n<p>If any one has any ideas on what I might be doing wrong / or not doing, or has any questions – all feedback welcome thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","spring-mvc","dispatcher"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1173073,"reputation":3068,"user_id":1149785,"accept_rate":87,"display_name":"user"},"score":0,"creation_date":1431076116,"post_id":30119810,"comment_id":48349904,"body_markdown":"Are you sure that you start your app with such name?
