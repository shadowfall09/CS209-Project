Srikanth&#39;s second [link][1] was particularly helpful.\r\n\r\nReason for the error\r\n---\r\nJAI requires a vendor name for some of its deep internals, particularly the javax.imageio.spi.IIOServiceProvider which gets used by many (all?) of the image readers for their low-level IO. It&#39;s not picky what the string is, but it can&#39;t be null.\r\n\r\nRather than hard-code the vendor name, the ImageReaderSpi class gets the vendor name from sun.media.imageioimpl.common.PackageUtil.getVendor(). This in turn _reads it from the jar&#39;s MANIFEST.MF_. Normally you link against the standard jai-imageio packagage, so Sun&#39;s vendor info gets read.

I am minimally assuming the following:\r\n\r\n 1. Include the [bean-validation-api][1] JAR in your classpath. This gets you the annotation.\r\n 2. Include a Bean Validation implementation JAR (e.g., the reference implementation, [hibernate-validator][2]) in your classpath. This enables the validation framework.\r\n 3. Your request mapping could be of one the following forms:\r\n\r\n---\r\n    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)\r\n    public String dologin(@Valid @ModelAttribute(&quot;userForm&quot;) User user, final BindingResult bindingResult) throws Exception\r\n\r\n---\r\n    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)\r\n    public String dologin(@Validated @ModelAttribute(&quot;userForm&quot;) User user, final BindingResult bindingResult) throws Exception\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nor, if using [validation groups][3]:\r\n\r\n---\r\n    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)\r\n    public String dologin(@Validated({ User.Login.class }) @ModelAttribute(&quot;userForm&quot;) User user, final BindingResult bindingResult) throws Exception\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n  4. Your annotation in the User class should be inline with message property keys:\r\n\r\n---\r\n    @NotBlank(message = &quot;{firstName.required}&quot;)\r\n    @Size(min = 2, max = 24, message = &quot;{firstName.size}&quot;)\r\n    @Pattern(regexp = &quot;^[’&#39; \\\\.\\\\-\\\\p{L}\\\\p{M}]*$&quot;, message = &quot;{firstName.format}&quot;)\r\n    private String firstName;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nor, if using [validation groups][3]:\r\n\r\n---\r\n    public interface Login extends Default {}\r\n\r\n    @NotBlank(message = &quot;{firstName.required}&quot;, groups = {Login.class})\r\n    @Size(min = 2, max = 24, message = &quot;{firstName.size}&quot;, groups = {Login.class})\r\n    @Pattern(regexp = &quot;^[’&#39; \\\\.\\\\-\\\\p{L}\\\\p{M}]*$&quot;, message = &quot;{firstName.format}&quot;, groups = {Login.class})\r\n    private String firstName;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n  5. Your message properties should be in `src/main/resources`:\r\n\r\n---\r\n    firstName.required=First name is required.\r\n    firstName.size=First name must be between {min} and {max} characters long.\r\n    firstName.format=First name may contain only letters, apostrophes, spaces and hyphens.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMake sure your [Bean Validation specification][4] version matches your implementation version. [Bean Validation API 2.0][1] was released in August 2017. The Bean Validation 2.0 Reference Implementation is [Hibernate Validation Engine 6.0][2].\r\n\r\nThe validation errors will be added to the `BindingResult` if that is present in the method parameters. Alternatively, you can use `Errors` in place of `BindingResult` - the API is essentially the same. Both of these work equivalently in my above implementation.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I leave the parameter out of my controller method, I see (from logging) that the validation is triggered and the appropriate errors are raised and the mapping of my message keys to their properties succeed, but my Server Error page is rendered instead of my expected view. For additional information on the requirement of this parameter, see this related question on the [BindingResult/Errors parameter][5].\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n    Aug 31, 2017 2:21:56 PM com.test.spring.controller.ErrorController handleException\r\n    SEVERE: Server Error\r\n    org.springframework.validation.BindException: org.springframework.validation.BeanPropertyBindingResult: 2 errors\r\n    Field error in object &#39;userForm&#39; on field &#39;firstName&#39;: rejected value []; codes [Size.userForm.firstName,Size.firstName,Size.java.lang.String,Size]; arguments [org.springframework.context.support.DefaultMessageSourceResolvable: codes [userForm.firstName,firstName]; arguments []; default message [firstName],24,2]; default message [First name must be between 2 and 24 characters long.]\r\n    Field error in object &#39;userForm&#39; on field &#39;firstName&#39;: rejected value []; codes [NotBlank.userForm.firstName,NotBlank.firstName,NotBlank.java.lang.String,NotBlank]; arguments [org.springframework.context.support.DefaultMessageSourceResolvable: codes [userForm.firstName,firstName]; arguments []; default message [firstName]]; default message [First name is required.]\r\n    \tat org.springframework.web.method.annotation.ModelAttributeMethodProcessor.resolveArgument(ModelAttributeMethodProcessor.java:117)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI see very consistent behavior in all of the above combinations.\r\n\r\nOne difference I note is that you are using `@ControllerAdvice` in your example. Most of my controllers use the [`@Controller`][6] annotation (local controller errors), not [`@ControllerAdvice`][7] (used for global errors, such as for rendering HTTP 404 or 500 error pages). See this related question/answer for the use of [`@ControllerAdvice`][8].\r\n\r\nIn the above error log, you see that `ErrorController` is the one reporting the validation errors if I leave out the `BindingResult`/`Errors` parameter, and indeed that is my controller class that uses `@ControllerAdvice` annotation instead of `@Controller`. By using `@ControllerAdvice` on your login controller you may be interfering with normal error handling.\r\n\r\nSince you are using the [Hibernate-specific][9] [`@Validated`][3] group validation annotation instead of the [JSR-303/349/380][4] specification [`@Valid`][10] annotation, there may be some differences between the implementation you used (I&#39;m guessing version 5, which conformed to API 1.1).
