If the file is small enough, you could just store the indexes (offset) in memory without needing a separate file for it.</p>\n<p>The offsets can be calculated by using the RandomAccessFile</p>\n<pre><code>RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(&quot;myFile.txt&quot;,&quot;r&quot;); \n//above 'r' means open in read only mode\nArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; arrayList = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();\nString cur_line = &quot;&quot;;\nwhile((cur_line=raf.readLine())!=null)\n{\n    arrayList.add(raf.getFilePointer());\n}\n//Print the 32 line\n//Seeks the file to the particular location from where our '32' line starts\nraf.seek(raf.seek(arrayList.get(31));\nSystem.out.println(raf.readLine());\nraf.close();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also visit the Java docs on <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/RandomAccessFile.html#mode\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RandomAccessFile</a> for more information:</p>\n<p><strong>Complexity</strong>: This is O(n) as it reads the entire file once. Please be aware for the memory requirements. If it's too big to be in memory, then make a temporary file that stores the offsets instead of ArrayList as shown above.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: If all you want in '32' line, you just have to call the <code>readLine()</code> also available through other classes '32' times.

See links: [HttpClient Overview][1] and [Apache HttpComponents][2] - This is one of the most reliable and popular Http clients\r\n 2. OK Http Client. See links [OkHttpClient][3], [OkHttp Maven repository][4]\r\n 3.

There are several well known 3d party Http clients out there. Basically with each one you will need to replicate the same Http requests that you sent with your postman. For each request from postman (you are talking about 2 API end-points here: Login URL and some post method for exchange of the info using the token you received in from your login call) you can see the headers that you sent and you will need to send the same headers with your Http clients of your choice. Here are some recommended Http clients:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Apache Http Client.

Take his advice to heart.\r\n\r\nOracle has a helpful tutorial, [Creating a GUI With Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/index.html).  Skip the Learning Swing with the NetBeans IDE section.  \r\n\r\nI revised your GUI.  Here&#39;s a test result.\r\n\r\n[![Web Response][1]][1]\r\n\r\n# Explanation\r\n\r\nWhen I create a Swing GUI, I use the [model-view-controller][2] (MVC) pattern.  This pattern allows me to separate my concerns and focus on one part of the application at a time.\r\n\r\nBy making use of classes and methods I can further separate my concerns and focus on a smaller part of the application.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I did was create an application model.  An application model consists of one or more plain Java getter/setter classes.\r\n\r\n## Model\r\n\r\nA `JList` can accept any `Object`, so I created a `WebResponse` class that holds a web address and a boolean that tells me whether or not a response happened.\r\n\r\nI created a `WebResponseModel` class to hold a `DefaultListModel`.  I used a `DefaultListModel` because I was using a `JList`.\r\n\r\n## View\r\n\r\nAll Swing applications must start with a call to the `SwingUtilities` `invokeLater` method.  This method ensures that the Swing components are created and executed on the [Event Dispatch Thread](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/dispatch.html).\r\n\r\nI separated the creation of the `JFrame` from the creation of the `JPanel` and `JScrollPane`.  I have difficulty understanding code that&#39;s all jumbled up in one method.\r\n\r\nThe `JFrame` has a default `BorderLayout`, which I used.  I managed the closing of the `JFrame` myself so I could stop the Swing `Timer`.\r\n\r\nThe entry `JPanel` uses a `FlowLayout`.\r\n\r\nI separated the `ListCellRenderer` code into its own class.\r\n\r\n## Controller\r\n\r\nI used a Swing `Timer` to control the testing of the web addresses, rather than a utility `Timer`.

Take his advice to heart.</p>\n<p>Oracle has a helpful tutorial, <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Creating a GUI With Swing</a>.  Skip the Learning Swing with the NetBeans IDE section.</p>\n<p>I revised your GUI.  Here's a test result.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ycLPZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ycLPZ.png\" alt=\"Web Response\" /></a></p>\n<h1>Explanation</h1>\n<p>When I create a Swing GUI, I use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">model-view-controller</a> (MVC) pattern.  This pattern allows me to separate my concerns and focus on one part of the application at a time.</p>\n<p>By making use of classes and methods I can further separate my concerns and focus on a smaller part of the application.</p>\n<p>The first thing I did was create an application model.  An application model consists of one or more plain Java getter/setter classes.</p>\n<h2>Model</h2>\n<p>A <code>JList</code> can accept any <code>Object</code>, so I created a <code>WebResponse</code> class that holds a web address and a boolean that tells me whether or not a response happened.</p>\n<p>I created a <code>WebResponseModel</code> class to hold a <code>DefaultListModel</code>.  I used a <code>DefaultListModel</code> because I was using a <code>JList</code>.</p>\n<h2>View</h2>\n<p>All Swing applications must start with a call to the <code>SwingUtilities</code> <code>invokeLater</code> method.  This method ensures that the Swing components are created and executed on the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/dispatch.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Event Dispatch Thread</a>.</p>\n<p>I separated the creation of the <code>JFrame</code> from the creation of the <code>JPanel</code> and <code>JScrollPane</code>.  I have difficulty understanding code that's all jumbled up in one method.</p>\n<p>The <code>JFrame</code> has a default <code>BorderLayout</code>, which I used.  I managed the closing of the <code>JFrame</code> myself so I could stop the Swing <code>Timer</code>.</p>\n<p>The entry <code>JPanel</code> uses a <code>FlowLayout</code>.</p>\n<p>I separated the <code>ListCellRenderer</code> code into its own class.</p>\n<h2>Controller</h2>\n<p>I used a Swing <code>Timer</code> to control the testing of the web addresses, rather than a utility <code>Timer</code>.  The <code>ActionListener</code> of the Swing <code>Timer</code> uses a method defined in the <code>WebResponse</code> model class.</p>\n<p>The &quot;Add&quot;  <code>JButton</code> <code>ActionListener</code> is a lambda because all it does is add the web address to the <code>DefaultListModel</code>.</p>\n<h1>Code</h1>\n<p>There are no static fields.

The redirect URI points to localhost:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp://localhost:11120/login/oauth2/code/\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in my production environment, the code is containerised into `Docker` images, which are deployed to a set of `AWS` `EC2` instances sitting behind a load balancer and the Azure AD instance is an official production one registered for my organisation. The redirect URI references the load balancer (note the lack of a trailing forward slash):\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://my-load-balancer:11120/login/oauth2/code\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my production deployment, browser users are first redirected to the Microsoft login screen as expected, and they are successfully able to authenticate themselves. But when the application then attempts to obtain a token, I see a repeating redirection loop in the logs, as pasted below. Note that the logs have been sanitized and the tokens replaced with `0.ARXXXXX` for brevity. I have labelled the initial request plus the first and second attempts to authenticate, after that the same pattern is seen in a loop.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    Original request:\r\n    2022-12-06 15:58:59,437 DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.FilterChainProxy [https-jsse-nio-11120-exec-10] Securing GET /content/documents/myapp?test_no=I1111115432BBBBBBB&amp;entry_number=415895J\r\n    \r\n    2022-12-06 15:58:59,446 DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.access.intercept.FilterSecurityInterceptor [https-jsse-nio-11120-exec-10] Failed to authorize filter invocation [GET /content/documents\r\n    /myapp?test_no=I1111115432BBBBBBB&amp;entry_number=415895J] with attributes [authenticated]\r\n    \r\n    2022-12-06 15:58:59,461 DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.HttpSessionRequestCache [https-jsse-nio-11120-exec-10] Saved request https://my-load-balancer:11120/content/\r\n    documents/myapp?test_no=I1111115432BBBBBBB&amp;entry_number=415895J to session\r\n    \r\n    First attempt to authenticate:\r\n    2022-12-06 15:58:59,470 DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.DefaultRedirectStrategy [https-jsse-nio-11120-exec-10] Redirecting to https://my-load-balancer:11120/oauth2/authorization/azure\r\n    \r\n    2022-12-06 15:58:59,537 DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.FilterChainProxy [https-jsse-nio-11120-exec-9] Securing GET /oauth2/authorization/azure\r\n    \r\n    2022-12-06 15:58:59,558 DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.DefaultRedirectStrategy [https-jsse-nio-11120-exec-9] Redirecting to https://login.microsoftonline.com/ac52f73c-fd1a-4a9a-8e7a-4a248f31\r\n    39e1/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?response_type=code&amp;client_id=YYYYYYY&amp;scope=openid%20profile%20offline_access&amp;state=0jyV5HiOjxBLTG4cIs1koydlLFEPCZx_4RWuNg3wQpw%3D&amp;redirect_uri\r\n    =https://my-load-balancer:11120/login/oauth2/code&amp;nonce=N-Tc2RIad5dFccOHTx79ifPhgs4UYoEnnJIJk0rApl8\r\n    \r\n    2022-12-06 15:59:00,356 DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.FilterChainProxy [https-jsse-nio-11120-exec-10] Securing GET /login/oauth2/code?code=0.ARXXXXX\r\n    \r\n    2022-12-06 15:59:00,357 DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.access.intercept.FilterSecurityInterceptor [https-jsse-nio-11120-exec-10] Failed to authorize filter invocation [GET /login/oauth2/code\r\n    ?code=0.ARXXXXX] with attributes [authenticated]\r\n    \r\n    2022-12-06 15:59:00,358 DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.HttpSessionRequestCache [https-jsse-nio-11120-exec-10] Saved request https://my-load-balancer:11120/login/oa\r\n    uth2/code?code=0.ARXXXXX to session\r\n    \r\n    Second attempt to authenticate:\r\n    2022-12-06 15:59:00,358 DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.DefaultRedirectStrategy [https-jsse-nio-11120-exec-10] Redirecting to https://my-load-balancer:11120/oauth2/authorization/azure\r\n    \r\n    2022-12-06 15:59:00,391 DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.FilterChainProxy [https-jsse-nio-11120-exec-1] Securing GET /oauth2/authorization/azure\r\n    \r\n    2022-12-06 15:59:00,415 DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.DefaultRedirectStrategy [https-jsse-nio-11120-exec-1] Redirecting to https://login.microsoftonline.com/ac52f73c-fd1a-4a9a-8e7a-4a248f31\r\n    39e1/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?response_type=code&amp;client_id=YYYYYYY&amp;scope=openid%20profile%20offline_access&amp;state=N6S7RwKvgVQjwB1oAzcdvBF0rcCVbMkemLVV4KjfaKU%3D&amp;redirect_uri\r\n    =https://my-load-balancer:11120/login/oauth2/code&amp;nonce=_Bg814QoGQJv7fbzslGq2oh_MePQLPBHTp8j2wdkY0w\r\n    \r\n    2022-12-06 15:59:00,693 DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.FilterChainProxy [https-jsse-nio-11120-exec-3] Securing GET /login/oauth2/code?code=0.ARXXXXX\r\n    \r\n    2022-12-06 15:59:00,694 DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.access.intercept.FilterSecurityInterceptor [https-jsse-nio-11120-exec-3] Failed to authorize filter invocation [GET /login/oauth2/code?\r\n    code=0.ARXXXXX] with attributes [authenticated]\r\n    \r\n    2022-12-06 15:59:00,695 DEBUG org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.HttpSessionRequestCache [https-jsse-nio-11120-exec-3] Saved request https://my-load-balancer:11120/login/oau\r\n    th2/code?code=0.ARXXXXX to session\r\n    \r\n    Further attempts to authenticate follow in a loop until &#39;too many redirects&#39; error is seen in browser.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a first attempt to fix this issue, I added the security exceptions seen in the code example above to exempt those patterns from security, but this made no difference.\r\n\r\nI then thought that perhaps the Docker container could not &#39;see&#39; login.microsoftonline.com in order to authenticate. However, I can clearly see it in the logs and I do not see any connection exceptions or similar that I would expect to see if this were the issue.\r\n\r\nNow, I am thinking that the issue may well be due to the fact that the redirect URI points to a load balancer rather than localhost. Regarding this, I was advised to use the following config settings, but it had no effect:\r\n\r\n```\r\nserver.forward-headers-strategy=NATIVE\r\nserver.tomcat.redirect-context-root=false\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am now thinking that I should try setting the redirect URI to localhost rather than the load balancer and to include a trailing slash in the redirect URI. I will try this, but as I am working in a tied down production environment, it will take a few days to effect.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I would be very grateful for any suggestions or ideas and I thank you for reading my post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"Too many redirects: SSO implementation in Spring Boot using OAuth2 against Azure AD","body":"<p>In my <code>Java 11</code>, <code>Spring Boot 2.7.4</code>, <code>Maven</code> application, I am using <code>Spring Security</code>, specifically <code>AadWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter</code>, in order to authenticate my users via Azure AD Integration following a tutorial.

I&#39;ve tried to fix it but I&#39;m unable to figure out a solution. I&#39;m learning to code and i need a hint.\r\n\r\nThis Java code implements a function that sorts an input string alphabetically without using arrays. The function is called sortWords and it takes three arguments: phrase, which is the string to be sorted; splitBy, which is the character or string of characters that will be used to split the string into individual words; and order, which is a character that determines whether the output order should be ascending (&#39;&lt;&#39;) or descending (&#39;&gt;&#39;).\r\n\r\nsortWords uses several helper functions to accomplish its task. The countWords function counts the number of words in a given string, using the given character or string of characters as a delimiter. The getWord function retrieves a specific word from a given string, using the given character or string of characters as a delimiter. And the replaceWord function replaces a specific word in a given string with another given word, using the given character or string of characters as a delimiter.\r\n\r\nThe main logic of sortWords is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Count the number of words in the given string using countWords.\r\n2. Iterate over all the words in the string, from the first to the last.\r\n3. For each word, search for the smallest word that comes before it in the string and has not been processed yet.\r\n4. If a smaller word is found, replace it with the original word using replaceWord, and save the original word for later use.\r\n5. Repeat this process until all words in the string have been processed.\r\n6. If a descending order (&#39;&gt;&#39;) has been specified, reverse the order of the words in the string using an auxiliary string and getWord.\r\n7. Return the sorted string.\r\n\r\nExpected result:  &#39;arbol,bedel,casa,diploma,excursion,factura,guea,xilofono&#39;.\r\nSince &#39;f&#39; comes before &#39;g&#39; in the alphabet.\r\n\r\nObserved result: &#39;arbol,bedel,casa,diploma,excursion,guea,factura,xilofono&#39;.\r\nI think it fails because factura is the first word in the input string.\r\n\r\n``` lang-java\r\n    static Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n    public static void main(String[] args){\r\n        /* sort alphabetically this string without using arrays*/\r\n        String phrase;\r\n        phrase = &quot;factura,casa,arbol,xilofono,bedel,diploma,excursion,guea&quot;;\r\n        System.out.println(sortWords(phrase, &quot;,&quot;, &#39;&lt;&#39;));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static String getWord(String phrase, String splitBy, int number){\r\n        String word;\r\n        Scanner splitter;\r\n        int count;\r\n        splitter = new Scanner(phrase);\r\n        splitter.useDelimiter(splitBy);\r\n        word = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        count = 1;\r\n        while (count &lt;= number){\r\n            word = splitter.next();\r\n            count++;\r\n        }\r\n        return word;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static int countWords(String phrase, String splitBy){\r\n        int count;\r\n        int position;\r\n        count = 0;\r\n        position = 0;\r\n        while(position != -1){\r\n            if (count == 0){\r\n                position = phrase.indexOf(splitBy);\r\n            } else {\r\n                position = phrase.indexOf(splitBy, position + 1);\r\n            }\r\n            if (position != -1){\r\n                count++;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return count + 1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static String sortWords(String phrase, String splitBy, char order){\r\n        int numberOfWords;\r\n        numberOfWords = countWords(phrase, splitBy);\r\n        for(int count = 1 ; count &lt;= numberOfWords; count++){\r\n            String wordToCheck;\r\n            String wordToSwitchWith;\r\n            int switchWithNumber;\r\n            wordToCheck = getWord(phrase, splitBy, count);\r\n            wordToSwitchWith = wordToCheck;\r\n            switchWithNumber = count;\r\n            for(int checkVS = count -1 ; checkVS &gt;= 1; checkVS--){\r\n                String wordToCompareWith;\r\n                wordToCompareWith = getWord(phrase, splitBy, checkVS);\r\n                if(wordToCheck.compareTo(wordToCompareWith) &lt; 0 ){\r\n                    wordToSwitchWith =  wordToCompareWith;\r\n                    switchWithNumber = checkVS;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            phrase = replaceWord(phrase, splitBy, count, wordToSwitchWith);\r\n            phrase = replaceWord(phrase, splitBy, switchWithNumber, wordToCheck);\r\n        }\r\n        if (order == &#39;&gt;&#39;){\r\n            String aux;\r\n            aux = &quot;&quot;;\r\n            for(int count = numberOfWords ; count &gt;= 1; count--){\r\n                aux += getWord(phrase, splitBy, count);\r\n                if(count != 1){\r\n                    aux += splitBy;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            phrase = aux;\r\n        }\r\n        return phrase;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static String replaceWord(String phrase, String splitBy, int position, String replacement){\r\n        String output;\r\n        int numberOfWords;\r\n        output=&quot;&quot;;\r\n        numberOfWords = countWords(phrase, splitBy);\r\n        for(int count = 1 ; count &lt;= numberOfWords; count++){\r\n            if(count != position){\r\n                output += getWord(phrase, splitBy, count);\r\n            } else {\r\n                output += replacement;\r\n            }\r\n            if(count != numberOfWords){\r\n                output += splitBy;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return output;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","title":"This Java code alphabetically sorts a string without using arrays.

It then sets the first element of a temporary array to be this letter and calls the findword function which takes the location of the letter in the array and checks each direction for the next letter. It does this until the array matches the target string or all of the directions return false. I don't think there's anything wrong with what I did but I'm getting errors so apparently I have made an error. Any insight would be much appreciated!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","exception"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":11683,"reputation":1438219,"user_id":22656,"accept_rate":86,"display_name":"Jon Skeet"},"score":4,"creation_date":1402677979,"post_id":24210164,"comment_id":37381593,"body_markdown":"What makes you think you need to explicitly print out the message?
