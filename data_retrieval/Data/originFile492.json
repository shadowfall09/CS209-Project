I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be able to follow it.\r\n\r\nThe short answer, however, is that it depends on whether or not that constant is part of the specification of the System Under Test (SUT).\r\n\r\nImagine, as an illustrative example, that you have to TDD a little *Hello World* API.\r\n\r\nYou might write a few test cases like this:\r\n\r\n    [Theory]\r\n    [InlineData(&quot;Mary&quot;)]\r\n    [InlineData(&quot;Sue&quot;)]\r\n    public void ExactEnglishSpec(string name)\r\n    {\r\n        var sut = new Greeter();\r\n\r\n        var actual = sut.Greet(name);\r\n\r\n        Assert.StartsWith(&quot;Hello, &quot;, actual);\r\n        Assert.EndsWith(name + &quot;.&quot;, actual);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis might drive an implementation like this:\r\n\r\n    public sealed class Greeter\r\n    {\r\n        private const string englishTemplate = &quot;Hello, {0}.&quot;;\r\n    \r\n        public string Greet(string name)\r\n        {\r\n            return string.Format(englishTemplate, name);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAs in the OP, this implementation contains a `private const string`. What happens if that `englishTemplate` changes?\r\n\r\nObviously, the tests fail.\r\n\r\nAs they should, since you wrote them that way.\r\n\r\nTests specify the behaviour of the software, and if they assert that a string should be exactly a particular value, then that is part of the specification, and it&#39;s a breaking change if it changes.\r\n\r\nThis may or may not be what you want.\r\n\r\nIt depends on what you&#39;re doing. If you&#39;re implementing a formal specification that demands that exact template string, then that *should* be part of the contract, and it *should* be a breaking change if someone changes the template. This would also be true if it&#39;s part of an API where you&#39;ve agreed with callers that the string will always be based on that template.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this may not be what you want. If you&#39;re implementing an (object-oriented) API that encapsulates behaviour, and you expect that the template might change in the future, write a more robust test:\r\n\r\n    [Theory]\r\n    [InlineData(&quot;Rose&quot;)]\r\n    [InlineData(&quot;Mary&quot;)]\r\n    public void RobustEnglishBehaviour(string name)\r\n    {\r\n        var sut = new Greeter();\r\n\r\n        var actual = sut.Greet(name);\r\n\r\n        Assert.Contains(name, actual);\r\n        Assert.NotEqual(name, actual);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe first assertion here verifies that the `name` is to be found somewhere in `actual`. The second assertion prevents the implementation from simply echoing back the name.\r\n\r\nNow, if you change the template, this robust test still passes, while the first example would break.\r\n\r\nBy now, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re asking: *But how can I verify that the return value isn&#39;t just some nonsense?*\r\n\r\nIn a sense, you can&#39;t, because you&#39;ve made the decision that the actual value is no longer part of the contract. Imagine that, instead of an English greeting, you&#39;re asked to internationalise the API. Will you, as the developer, be able to verify that greetings in Romanian, Chinese, Thai, Korean, etc. are correct?\r\n\r\nProbably not. Those strings are going to be opaque to you, hopefully instead supplied by professional translators.\r\n\r\nHow do you test against something like that?\r\n\r\nNaively, one might attempt something like this:\r\n\r\n    [Theory]\r\n    [InlineData(&quot;Hans&quot;)]\r\n    [InlineData(&quot;Christian&quot;)]\r\n    public void ExactDanishSpec(string name)\r\n    {\r\n        var sut = new Greeter();\r\n        sut.Culture = &quot;da-DK&quot;;\r\n\r\n        var actual = sut.Greet(name);\r\n\r\n        Assert.StartsWith(&quot;Hej &quot;, actual);\r\n        Assert.EndsWith(name + &quot;.&quot;, actual);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis might drive an implementation like this:\r\n\r\n    public sealed class Greeter\r\n    {\r\n        private const string englishTemplate = &quot;Hello, {0}.&quot;;\r\n        private const string danishTemplate = &quot;Hej {0}.&quot;;\r\n    \r\n        public string? Culture { get; set; }\r\n    \r\n        public string Greet(string name)\r\n        {\r\n            if (Culture == &quot;da-DK&quot;)\r\n                return string.Format(danishTemplate, name);\r\n            else\r\n                return string.Format(englishTemplate, name);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAgain, this is *an exact specification.* I&#39;ll remind you that this example is just a placeholder for a &#39;real&#39; problem. If the exact string is part of the specification, then writing the test as shown above seems appropriate, but that also means that if you change the strings, the tests will break. And that&#39;s by design.\r\n\r\nIf you instead want to write a more robust test, you might do something like this:\r\n\r\n    [Theory]\r\n    [InlineData(&quot;Charlotte&quot;)]\r\n    [InlineData(&quot;Martin&quot;)]\r\n    public void EnglishIsDifferentFromDanish(string name)\r\n    {\r\n        var sut = new Greeter();\r\n        var unexpected = sut.Greet(name);\r\n        sut.Culture = &quot;da-DK&quot;;\r\n\r\n        var actual = sut.Greet(name);\r\n\r\n        Assert.Contains(name, actual);\r\n        Assert.NotEqual(name, actual);\r\n        Assert.NotEqual(unexpected, actual);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThese assertions again verify that the name is included in the response, and not just echoed back. Furthermore, the test asserts that the Danish greeting isn&#39;t the same as the English greeting.\r\n\r\nThis test is *more* robust than the exact specification, but isn&#39;t absolutely guaranteed never to fail. If, in the future, translators decide that the English greeting and the Danish greeting should use effectively equal templates, the test would fail.\r\n\r\nComing back to the OP. How about exposing the templates as public constants?\r\n\r\nSure, you could do that if the exact value is *not* part of the specification:\r\n\r\n    public const string EnglishTemplate = &quot;Hello, {0}.&quot;;\r\n    public const string DanishTemplate = &quot;Hej {0}.&quot;;\r\n\r\nThis would enable you to write a test like this:\r\n\r\n    [Theory]\r\n    [InlineData(&quot;Thelma&quot;)]\r\n    [InlineData(&quot;Louise&quot;)]\r\n    public void UseEnglishTemplate(string name)\r\n    {\r\n        var sut = new Greeter();\r\n        var actual = sut.Greet(name);\r\n        Assert.Equal(string.Format(Greeter.EnglishTemplate, name), actual);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nDoes that, however, provide any value? It essentially just repeats the implementation code.\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t repeat yourself.\r\n\r\nStill, just to drive home the point: Such a test would be robust to changes of the template strings. The test would pass even if you edit the string. Is that appropriate?\r\n\r\nThat depends on whether or not the exact string value is part of the public contract for the SUT.\r\n\r\nThis line of reasoning applies not only to strings, but also to constant numbers.\r\n\r\nIf the constant is part of the contract, write your tests in such a way that they fail if the constant changes. If the constant is an implementation detail, write robust tests that pass when the value changes.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tdd","title":"change visibility of a private java constant to test it","body":"<p>Since this question is tagged <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tdd\">tdd</a>, I'm going to pretend that the OP didn't include</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>when I want to make the test for this class</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After all, TDD means <em>test-driven development</em>; i.e. write the test <em>before</em> the implementation.</p>\n<p>Additionally, since this issue is a problem in several programming languages, and not just Java, I'm going to respond with some C# code. I'm sure you'll be able to follow it.</p>\n<p>The short answer, however, is that it depends on whether or not that constant is part of the specification of the System Under Test (SUT).</p>\n<p>Imagine, as an illustrative example, that you have to TDD a little <em>Hello World</em> API.</p>\n<p>You might write a few test cases like this:</p>\n<pre><code>[Theory]\n[InlineData(&quot;Mary&quot;)]\n[InlineData(&quot;Sue&quot;)]\npublic void ExactEnglishSpec(string name)\n{\n    var sut = new Greeter();\n\n    var actual = sut.Greet(name);\n\n    Assert.StartsWith(&quot;Hello, &quot;, actual);\n    Assert.EndsWith(name + &quot;.&quot;, actual);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This might drive an implementation like this:</p>\n<pre><code>public sealed class Greeter\n{\n    private const string englishTemplate = &quot;Hello, {0}.&quot;;\n\n    public string Greet(string name)\n    {\n        return string.Format(englishTemplate, name);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As in the OP, this implementation contains a <code>private const string</code>. What happens if that <code>englishTemplate</code> changes?</p>\n<p>Obviously, the tests fail.</p>\n<p>As they should, since you wrote them that way.</p>\n<p>Tests specify the behaviour of the software, and if they assert that a string should be exactly a particular value, then that is part of the specification, and it's a breaking change if it changes.</p>\n<p>This may or may not be what you want.</p>\n<p>It depends on what you're doing. If you're implementing a formal specification that demands that exact template string, then that <em>should</em> be part of the contract, and it <em>should</em> be a breaking change if someone changes the template. This would also be true if it's part of an API where you've agreed with callers that the string will always be based on that template.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, this may not be what you want. If you're implementing an (object-oriented) API that encapsulates behaviour, and you expect that the template might change in the future, write a more robust test:</p>\n<pre><code>[Theory]\n[InlineData(&quot;Rose&quot;)]\n[InlineData(&quot;Mary&quot;)]\npublic void RobustEnglishBehaviour(string name)\n{\n    var sut = new Greeter();\n\n    var actual = sut.Greet(name);\n\n    Assert.Contains(name, actual);\n    Assert.NotEqual(name, actual);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first assertion here verifies that the <code>name</code> is to be found somewhere in <code>actual</code>. The second assertion prevents the implementation from simply echoing back the name.</p>\n<p>Now, if you change the template, this robust test still passes, while the first example would break.</p>\n<p>By now, I'm sure you're asking: <em>But how can I verify that the return value isn't just some nonsense?</em></p>\n<p>In a sense, you can't, because you've made the decision that the actual value is no longer part of the contract. Imagine that, instead of an English greeting, you're asked to internationalise the API. Will you, as the developer, be able to verify that greetings in Romanian, Chinese, Thai, Korean, etc. are correct?</p>\n<p>Probably not.

But if I want to loop through all pivot filters in my table I only see one of 20.</p>\n<pre><code>   public void createKostenFiles() {\n\n        try {\n            FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(&quot;C:\\\\Users\\\\bglaus\\\\Documents\\\\RFC_2023.01_Kosten_.xlsx&quot;);\n            Workbook w = new XSSFWorkbook();\n\n            w = new XSSFWorkbook(fis);\n\n            for (Kostenstelle k : kostenstellen) {\n                Workbook workbook = w;\n                XSSFSheet s = (XSSFSheet) workbook.getSheet(&quot;BI Import&quot;);\n                XSSFSheet s2 = (XSSFSheet) workbook.getSheet(&quot;Last FC&quot;);\n                XSSFSheet s3 = (XSSFSheet) workbook.getSheet(&quot;BI Gebuchte Fixkosten&quot;);\n                XSSFPivotTable pvt = s.getPivotTables().get(0);\n                for (CTPivotFilter ct : pvt.getCTPivotTableDefinition().getFilters().getFilterList()) {\n                    System.out.println(&quot;All: &quot; + ct.toString());\n                }\n            }\n\n        } catch (IOException ex) {\n            Logger.getLogger(Model.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);\n        }\n    }\n       \n</code></pre>\n<p>So my output on the console looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>All: &lt;xml-fragment fld=&quot;1&quot; type=&quot;valueEqual&quot; id=&quot;9196&quot; stringValue1=&quot;9196 - Kletter Shop 6a plus&quot; xmlns:mc=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006&quot; xmlns:xr=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/spreadsheetml/2014/revision&quot; xmlns:main=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/spreadsheetml/2006/main&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;main:autoFilter ref=&quot;A1&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;main:filterColumn colId=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;main:customFilters&gt;\n        &lt;main:customFilter operator=&quot;lessThanOrEqual&quot; val=&quot;3&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;/main:customFilters&gt;\n    &lt;/main:filterColumn&gt;\n  &lt;/main:autoFilter&gt;\n&lt;/xml-fragment&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And I get this same output for every cost center what makes sense but why do I only get this one filter on the line?</p>\n<pre><code>System.out.println(&quot;All: &quot; + ct.toString());\n</code></pre>\n<p>The pivot table in my excel sheet looks like this:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UY8pj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">my pivotfilters</a></p>\n<p>I thought first it only shows me the selected filters but thats not the issue, and I'm also wondering why it is the last filter.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","quarkus","mutiny"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":15318924,"reputation":143,"user_id":11052037,"display_name":"Schallabajzer"},"score":0,"creation_date":1681891425,"post_id":76051411,"comment_id":134128369,"body_markdown":"Wouldn&#39;t this way all the items would have the same delay value?

While most of the answers are quite acceptable, it would be really useful if it can be done in a proper resuable way.\r\n\r\nOne of the challenge I encountered is the need to have the single-double click differentiation on multiple nodes at multiple places.

The obvious drawback is that even a single click caught with `setOnMouseSingleClicked` will be delayed with the `singleClickDelayMillis` (exposed variable which should be set accordingly to the OS, as mentioned by Kleopatra).\r\n 2. Another noticeable fact, is that I extended `Button`, and not `Node` where it should be : The Class where the onMouseClicked(...) is implemented.\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n 3. As a last comment, I decided to add a new EventHandler rather than using the existing `setOnMousePressed`, `setOnMouseReleased` or `setOnMouseClicked` so that the developer can still fully implement these convenience `EventHandler`s. For example in order to have immediate response from a click on the button without waiting for the `singleClickDelayMillis`. But this means that if you implement both, the `setOnMouseClicked` will be fired even on a double click... beware.\r\n\r\nHere comes the code :\r\n\r\n    \r\n    import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;\r\n    \r\n    import javafx.application.Application;\r\n    import javafx.application.Platform;\r\n    import javafx.scene.Scene;\r\n    import javafx.scene.control.Button;\r\n    import javafx.scene.control.Label;\r\n    import javafx.scene.input.MouseEvent;\r\n    import javafx.scene.layout.VBox;\r\n    import javafx.stage.Stage;\r\n    import javafx.beans.property.ObjectProperty;\r\n    import javafx.event.EventHandler;\r\n    import javafx.beans.property.SimpleObjectProperty;\r\n    \r\n    public class DblClickCatchedWithoutSingleClick extends Application {\r\n\r\n\tpublic class ButtonWithDblClick extends Button {\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate long\t\tsingleClickDelayMillis\t= 250;\r\n\t\tprivate ClickRunner\tlatestClickRunner\t\t= null;\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate ObjectProperty&lt;EventHandler&lt;MouseEvent&gt;&gt;\tonMouseSingleClickedProperty\t= new SimpleObjectProperty&lt;&gt;();\r\n\t\tprivate ObjectProperty&lt;EventHandler&lt;MouseEvent&gt;&gt;\tonMouseDoubleClickedProperty\t= new SimpleObjectProperty&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n\t\t// CONSTRUCTORS\r\n\t\tpublic ButtonWithDblClick() {\r\n\t\t\tsuper();\r\n\t\t\taddClickedEventHandler();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic ButtonWithDblClick(String text) {\r\n\t\t\tsuper(text);\r\n\t\t\taddClickedEventHandler();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic ButtonWithDblClick(String text, Node graphic) {\r\n\t\t\tsuper(text, graphic);\r\n\t\t\taddClickedEventHandler();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate class ClickRunner implements Runnable {\r\n\r\n\t\t\tprivate final Runnable\tonClick;\r\n\t\t\tprivate boolean\t\t\taborted\t= false;\r\n\r\n\t\t\tpublic ClickRunner(Runnable onClick) {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.onClick = onClick;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\tpublic void abort() {\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.aborted = true;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t@Override\r\n\t\t\tpublic void run() {\r\n\t\t\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThread.sleep(singleClickDelayMillis);\r\n\t\t\t\t} catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\tif (!aborted) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPlatform.runLater(onClick::run);\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate void addClickedEventHandler() {\r\n\t\t\t//Handling the mouse clicked event (not using &#39;onMouseClicked&#39; so it can still be used by developer).\r\n\t\t\tEventHandler&lt;MouseEvent&gt; eventHandler = me -&gt; {\r\n\t\t\t\tswitch (me.getButton()) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcase PRIMARY:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (me.getClickCount() == 1) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlatestClickRunner = new ClickRunner(() -&gt; {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;ButtonWithDblClick : SINGLE Click fired&quot;);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonMouseSingleClickedProperty.get().handle(me);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCompletableFuture.runAsync(latestClickRunner);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (me.getClickCount() == 2) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (latestClickRunner != null) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlatestClickRunner.abort();\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;ButtonWithDblClick : DOUBLE Click fired&quot;);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonMouseDoubleClickedProperty.get().handle(me);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbreak;\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcase SECONDARY:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// Right-click operation.

everything seems ok but receive 404, check this answer:\r\n\r\n***As you know:**&lt;br&gt;*\r\nIn the Spring MVC you can return view as a ``String`` or ``ModelAndView`` object.\r\n\r\n***IMPORTANT NOTE:***\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nIn both cases you have to pay attention to **relative/absolute path**:&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n 1. If you declare ``/`` in the beginning of the view name, you are using **absolute path**.&lt;br&gt;\r\n  Namely it does not matter **class level** ``@RequestMapping`` and directly introduce itself as the **final view name**.\r\n 2. If you **do not** declare ``/`` in the beginning of the view name, you are using **relative path** (relative to the class path) and therefore it **appends** to the **class level** ``@RequestMapping`` to construct **final view name**.\r\n\r\nSo, you have to consider the above notes when use the Spring MVC.\r\n\r\n**Example:**&lt;br&gt;\r\n1. create two HTML file ``test1.html`` and ``test2.html`` in the ``static`` folder of spring (boot) structure:&lt;br&gt;\r\nPlease note that the **class level** ``@RequestMapping`` behaves as a **folder** path in the case of **relative** path.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n```\r\n--- resources\r\n    --- static\r\n        --- classLevelPath     //behaves as a folder when we use relative path scenario in view names   \r\n            --- test2.html      //this will be used for relative path [case (2)]\r\n        --- test1.html          //this will be used for absolute path [case (1)]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n2. create a controller class like as the below.

I have this Java code</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>String expr = &quot;490 + 34 + 8 * 42 /45 -cos(90)/sin(90)&quot;;\n\nList&lt;String&gt; tokens = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\nfor (int i = 0, j = 0, len = expr.length(); i &lt; len; i += j) {\n    String s = expr.chars()\n                   .skip(i)\n                   .filter(x -&gt; !Character.isWhitespace(x))\n                   .takeWhile(Character::isDigit)\n                   .takeWhile(Character::isLetter)\n                   .mapToObj(Character::toString)\n                   .reduce(&quot;&quot;, (acc, v) -&gt; acc.concat(v));\n    j += s.length();\n    tokens.add(s);\n}\nSystem.out.println(tokens);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The goal is to get the following result when printing value of [variable] <code>tokens</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>[490,+,34,+,8,*,42,/,45,-,cos,(,90,),/,sin,(,90,)]\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you run this code you'll get an infinite loop.\nThe problem is that <code>.takeWhile(Character::isDigit)</code> will return a stream consisting of &quot;4,9,0&quot; and then <code>.takeWhile(Character::isLetter)</code> will operate on it resulting in an empty stream and then <code>.reduce(&quot;&quot;, (acc, v) -&gt; acc.concat(v))</code> will return an empty string so <code>j</code> will be always 0.</p>\n<p>To achieve the expected result, <code>.takeWhile(Character::isLetter)</code> should be executed if and only if <code>.takeWhile(Character::isDigit)</code> returns an empty stream.<br />\n<strong>Example</strong><br />\nOn the first iteration the result of <code>.takeWhile(Character::isDigit)</code> is &quot;490&quot; so it should jump directly to <code>.mapToObj(Character::toString)</code> and the code should proceed normally.\nOn the second iteration, <code>.skip(i)</code> would skip &quot;490&quot; (i.e. the first 3 chars). <code>.takeWhile(Character::isDigit)</code> will result in an empty string and in this case <code>.takeWhile(Character::isLetter)</code> should operate on the result of\n<code>filter(x -&gt; !Character.isWhitespace(x))</code> so it would return &quot;+&quot; (just assume it's a letter) and continue processing the rest of the expression. This will go on until we parse the entire string.</p>\n<p>From my research, I have found that this is not really possible and the examples I have found are very complicated, which is not surprising, and don't solve my problem.
