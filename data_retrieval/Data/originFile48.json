If anyone has a more permanent fix, please let me (us) know.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":315203,"reputation":1249,"user_id":630833,"display_name":"jayeffkay"},"score":1,"creation_date":1682203592,"post_id":74673405,"comment_id":134178946,"body_markdown":"Humbly downvoted this, since solution is deprecated.","body":"Humbly downvoted this, since solution is deprecated."}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":9957379,"reputation":119,"user_id":7367757,"display_name":"SarathEXP "},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":6,"up_vote_count":13,"is_accepted":false,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1670136319,"creation_date":1670136319,"answer_id":74673405,"question_id":74634321,"body_markdown":"adding `android.defaults.buildfeatures.buildconfig=true` to your `gradle.properties` would fix this.","title":"Fixing the &quot;Build Type contains custom BuildConfig fields, but the feature is disabled&quot; error w/ buildConfigField","body":"<p>adding <code>android.defaults.buildfeatures.buildconfig=true</code> to your <code>gradle.properties</code> would fix this.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":5900723,"reputation":2918,"user_id":5187459,"accept_rate":15,"display_name":"Dazzle"},"score":6,"creation_date":1691265124,"post_id":74692390,"comment_id":135469588,"body_markdown":"for each module?

The second time and every other time after has no gap.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","servlets","ant","javac"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":183645,"reputation":3141,"user_id":419132,"accept_rate":95,"display_name":"wespiserA"},"score":0,"creation_date":1302549623,"post_id":5626317,"comment_id":6411173,"body_markdown":"please add some code, this question seems vague","body":"please add some code, this question seems vague"},{"owner":{"account_id":14531,"reputation":118870,"user_id":29995,"accept_rate":77,"display_name":"Rob Hruska"},"score":0,"creation_date":1302549746,"post_id":5626317,"comment_id":6411207,"body_markdown":"[Related](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5625589/javac-erroring-out-when-compiling-servlet-libraries)","body":"<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5625589/javac-erroring-out-when-compiling-servlet-libraries\">Related</a>"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":220897,"reputation":18271,"user_id":478573,"accept_rate":87,"display_name":"Genadinik"},"score":0,"creation_date":1302549794,"post_id":5626353,"comment_id":6411217,"body_markdown":"Here is the ant task: \t  &lt;target name=&quot;compile&quot; depends=&quot;prepare&quot; description=&quot;compile the source&quot; &gt;\n\t  \t&lt;echo&gt;=== COMPILE === SRCDIR: ${src}/com/udfr/src/java &lt;/echo&gt;\n\t    &lt;!-- Compile the java code from ${src} into ${build} --&gt;\n\t    &lt;javac srcdir=&quot;${src}/com/udfr/src/java&quot; destdir=&quot;${dist}/WEB-INF/classes&quot;/&gt;\n\t  &lt;/target&gt;","body":"Here is the ant task: \t  &lt;target name=&quot;compile&quot; depends=&quot;prepare&quot; description=&quot;compile the source&quot; &gt; \t  \t&lt;echo&gt;=== COMPILE === SRCDIR: ${src}/com/udfr/src/java &lt;/echo&gt; \t    &lt;!-- Compile the java code from ${src} into ${build} --&gt; \t    &lt;javac srcdir=&quot;${src}/com/udfr/src/java&quot; destdir=&quot;${dist}/WEB-INF/classes&quot;/&gt; \t  &lt;/target&gt;"},{"owner":{"account_id":11683,"reputation":1438219,"user_id":22656,"accept_rate":86,"display_name":"Jon Skeet"},"score":0,"creation_date":1302551144,"post_id":5626353,"comment_id":6411564,"body_markdown":"@Genadinik: Basically, you&#39;re not specifying a classpath *at all*.","body":"@Genadinik: Basically, you&#39;re not specifying a classpath <i>at all</i>."}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":11683,"reputation":1438219,"user_id":22656,"accept_rate":86,"display_name":"Jon Skeet"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1302549620,"creation_date":1302549620,"answer_id":5626353,"question_id":5626317,"body_markdown":"It&#39;s a common occurrence if you don&#39;t specify the servlet libraries properly in the classpath for the `javac` task...

A subclass must implement all my methods in order to implement me.

But they can also leave some of the methods unimplemented so the subclass can implement them. If you leave an interface method unimplemented, there is not need to declare it abstract, it is already in the contract.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n      \r\n\r\n      public abstract class myAbstractClass2 implement myInterface\r\n      {\r\n          @Override\r\n          public void methodA()\r\n          {\r\n              // this fulfills part of the contract with myInterface.\r\n              // my subclasses will not need to implement this unless they want to override\r\n              // my implementation.\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          //My subclasses must implement this to fulfill their contract with me\r\n          public abstract void methodD();\r\n      }\r\n\r\nSo in essence, an abstract class doesn&#39;t have as strict a contract with it&#39;s superclass because it can delegate its methods to its subclasses.\r\n\r\n**Regular Class**: (I use regular to mean non-interface, and non-abstract).

That&#39;s because you can&#39;t call a method on a null.\r\n\r\nYou should always check if your parameters are `null` before using them. Even if you think that they should never be `null` - because hackers can try to send stuff to your servlet without the control of your form.\r\n\r\nHere is what happens, step by step.\r\n\r\n 1. You display `index.jsp`. You click the button.\r\n 2. MainController runs. Since there is a `button` parameter that came from `index.jsp`, everything is OK, and it reaches the code at the end that forwards it into the `meeting_Id.jsp` which is now displayed on your browser.\r\n 3. You now click the button and send the form in the `meeting_Id.jsp` back to `MainController`.\r\n 4. Now, in this invocation, there is no parameter `button`. Therefore you get the NullPointerException.\r\n\r\nYou are working in an MVC environment. Every form is sent to the same controller, `MainContoller`, and `MainController` is supposed to be smart enough to know which form sent it the request, and handle it accordingly. But yours assumes only `index.jsp` is calling it. But it doesn&#39;t work like this. When you click the `next` button on `meeting_Id.jspa`, you are creating a **new request**, which goes to the same `MainController` servlet, and causes the error.\r\n\r\nYou should make sure your forms send some sort of ID that tells `MainController` which form is using it at the moment, and then the controller can send the request to be processed by the appropriate model.
