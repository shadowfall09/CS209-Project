(On the lower level it’s the other way round; the argument is not put into a new array when it is already an array.)\r\n\r\nIn other words, there is no difference between\r\n\r\n```java\r\nmethod.invoke(obj, new Object[]{si});\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```java\r\nmethod.invoke(obj, si);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you cast the array to `Object`, it will be treated like the first argument, as intended:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Example1 {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Throwable {\r\n        SomeInterface si = new SomeInterface() {};\r\n        Object obj = new SomeClass&lt;SomeInterface&gt;(){};\r\n        \r\n        // Knowing the type of obj\r\n        ((SomeClass&lt;SomeInterface&gt;)obj).add(si);\r\n\r\n        // Dont know the type of obj, but knowing the method name/signature\r\n        Class&lt;?&gt; clazz = obj.getClass();\r\n        Method method = clazz.getMethod(&quot;add&quot;, Object[].class);\r\n\r\n        method.invoke(obj, (Object)new Object[] { si });\r\n\r\n        // correct varargs handling works out-of-the-box with java.lang.invoke\r\n\r\n        MethodHandle mh = MethodHandles.lookup().findVirtual(clazz, &quot;add&quot;,\r\n                              MethodType.methodType(void.class, Object[].class));\r\n\r\n        mh.invoke(obj, si);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs an addendum, I include an example of the `java.lang.invoke` package, which does not have this problem, because `MethodHandle`’s `invoke` method is not a *varargs* method but *signature polymorphic* which means , it receives the arguments as passed, without any boxing.

The cost is pretty much constant and it is known at the point of writing the code.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":11531106,"reputation":41,"user_id":8474641,"display_name":"Antony Glim"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1674203972,"creation_date":1674203972,"answer_id":75181544,"question_id":653469,"body_markdown":"I set the logger settings to INFO level, and ran the following test:\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void loggerTest() {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;START &quot; + LocalDateTime.now());\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;TRACE: &quot; + LocalDateTime.now());\r\n        log.trace(&quot;{}&quot;, sleepAndReturnString(5000L, &quot;TRACE PRINT&quot;));\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;DEBUG: &quot; + LocalDateTime.now());\r\n        log.debug(&quot;{}&quot;, sleepAndReturnString(5000L, &quot;DEBUG PRINT&quot;));\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;INFO: &quot; + LocalDateTime.now());\r\n        log.info(&quot;{}&quot;, sleepAndReturnString(5000L, &quot;INFO PRINT&quot;));\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;WARN: &quot; + LocalDateTime.now());\r\n        log.warn(&quot;{}&quot;, sleepAndReturnString(5000L, &quot;WARN PRINT&quot;));\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;ERROR: &quot; + LocalDateTime.now());\r\n        log.error(&quot;{}&quot;, sleepAndReturnString(5000L, &quot;ERROR PRINT&quot;));\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;END &quot; + LocalDateTime.now());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static String sleepAndReturnString(long millis, String message) {\r\n        try {\r\n            Thread.sleep(millis);\r\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n            log.error(&quot;&quot;, e);\r\n        }\r\n        return message;\r\n    }\r\nlogback.xml file:\r\n\r\n    &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;property name=&quot;MY__PATTERN&quot;\r\n              value=&quot;%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} | %highlight(%-5level) | %message%n%rEx&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;appender name=&quot;CONSOLE&quot; class=&quot;ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;encoder class=&quot;ch.qos.logback.classic.encoder.PatternLayoutEncoder&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;outputPatternAsHeader&gt;true&lt;/outputPatternAsHeader&gt;\r\n            &lt;pattern&gt;${MY__PATTERN}&lt;/pattern&gt;\r\n        &lt;/encoder&gt;\r\n    &lt;/appender&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;root level=&quot;info&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;appender-ref ref=&quot;CONSOLE&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/root&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;/configuration&gt;\r\nHere is what was printed in the console:\r\n\r\n    START 2023-01-20T11:17:57.255\r\n    TRACE: 2023-01-20T11:17:57.255\r\n    DEBUG: 2023-01-20T11:18:02.256\r\n    INFO: 2023-01-20T11:18:07.262\r\n    2023-01-20 11:18:12.267 | INFO  | INFO PRINT\r\n    WARN: 2023-01-20T11:18:12.283\r\n    2023-01-20 11:18:17.285 | WARN  | WARN PRINT\r\n    ERROR: 2023-01-20T11:18:17.285\r\n    2023-01-20 11:18:22.287 | ERROR | ERROR PRINT\r\n    END 2023-01-20T11:18:22.287\r\n\r\nAs we can see, each time the thread fell asleep for 5 seconds, although the TRACE and DEBUG messages were not printed to the console.

My requirement is to retrieve the 10 **latest** (most recent) records from the Coverage table where the status is `Active`, and then to retrieve the Policy records for **those** 10 records simultaneously. These records will then be written to text files, one for each of the two tables. Then some fields in them will be updated and the updated records will be written to new text files.\r\n\r\nHere, for the coverage records, I use `order by updateDate desc` to sort the results in descending order, and in SQL Developer, instead of `top (10)` I have to put `where rownum &lt;= 10`. Therefore the read method implementing the first SQL query is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\npublic List&lt;Coverage&gt; readCoverRecords() {\r\n  EntityManager em = transactionManager.getEntityManager();\r\n  String coverQuery = &quot;From Coverage where status = &#39;Active&#39; and rownum &lt;= 10 order by updateDate&quot;;\r\n  TypedQuery&lt;Coverage&gt; tq = em.createQuery(coverQuery, Coverage.class);\r\n  return tq.getResultList();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich is easy enough. But the issue arises when I try to retrieve the Policy records for these ten Coverage records, which are linked by their account number. That is, if I were retrieving records from both tables, I would have used `Coverage.accountNumber = Policy.accountNumber` in the WHERE clause.

Moreover, in any case, this does not guarantee that the Policy records retrieved will be for the same account numbers as the Coverage records, since the updateDate of some records may have changed in the meantime.

Keeping the first element of every sublist works as expected because every sublist's begin index is shifted <code>N</code> elements to the right, according to the source list.</p>\n\n<p>This is also efficient, because the <code>List.sublist()</code> method returns a <em>view</em> of the original list, meaning that it doesn't create a new <code>List</code> for each iteration.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> After a while, I've learnt that it's much better to take either one of @sprinter's approachs, since <code>subList()</code> creates a wrapper around the original list. This means that the second list of the stream would be a wrapper of the first list, the third list of the stream would be a wrapper of the second list (which is already a wrapper!), and so on...</p>\n\n<p>While this might work for small to medium-sized lists, it should be noted that for a very large source list, many wrappers would be created.

Instead, use a new stack for every element, like so(with `GameBoard` renamed `gameboard`, per java naming conventions):\r\n```java\r\n    public Stack&lt;Integer&gt;[][] gameboard = new Stack[3][3];\r\n    public Stack&lt;Integer&gt;[][] FillBoard() {\r\n        //fill board with squares\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\r\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\r\n                Stack&lt;Integer&gt; square = new Stack&lt;&gt;();\r\n                square.push(0);\r\n                gameboard[i][j] = square;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        gameboard[1][1].push(1);\r\n        return gameboard;\r\n    }\r\n```","title":"Java Pushing an element into a single stack of a 2d array of stacks","body":"<p>This is because you are setting every stack in <code>Gameboard</code> to the same stack , <code>Square</code>.
