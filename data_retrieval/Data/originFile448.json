The server receives the request but does not have time to respond and throws:</p>\n\n<pre><code>INFO: Request from ex@ex.com\nMay 22, 2017 12:28:58 AM io.grpc.internal.SerializingExecutor run\nSEVERE: Exception while executing runnable io.grpc.internal.ServerImpl$JumpToApplicationThreadServerStreamListener$2@4be43082\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: call is closed\n    at com.google.common.base.Preconditions.checkState(Preconditions.java:174)\n    at io.grpc.internal.ServerCallImpl.sendHeaders(ServerCallImpl.java:103)\n    at io.grpc.stub.ServerCalls$ServerCallStreamObserverImpl.onNext(ServerCalls.java:282)\n    at ServiceImp.login(ServiceImp.java:20)\n    at tourism.RemoteServiceGrpc$MethodHandlers.invoke(RemoteServiceGrpc.java:187)\n    at io.grpc.stub.ServerCalls$1$1.onHalfClose(ServerCalls.java:148)\n    at io.grpc.internal.ServerCallImpl$ServerStreamListenerImpl.halfClosed(ServerCallImpl.java:262)\n    at io.grpc.internal.ServerImpl$JumpToApplicationThreadServerStreamListener$2.runInContext(ServerImpl.java:572)\n    at io.grpc.internal.ContextRunnable.run(ContextRunnable.java:52)\n    at io.grpc.internal.SerializingExecutor.run(SerializingExecutor.java:117)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Java server:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import io.grpc.Server;\nimport io.grpc.ServerBuilder;\nimport io.grpc.stub.StreamObserver;\nimport tourism.RemoteServiceGrpc;\nimport tourism.Service;\n\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.logging.Level;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\n/**\n * Created by Andu on 21/05/2017.\n */\npublic class ServerGrpc {\n    Logger logger= Logger.getLogger(ServerGrpc.class.getName());\n    private final Server server;\n    private final int port;\n\n    public ServerGrpc(int p){\n        port=p;\n        server= ServerBuilder.forPort(port).addService(new ServiceImp()).build();\n    }\n\n    public void start() throws IOException {\n        server.start();\n        logger.info(\"Server started, listening on \" + port);\n        Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                // Use stderr here since the logger may has been reset by its JVM shutdown hook.\n                System.err.println(\"*** shutting down gRPC server since JVM is shutting down\");\n                ServerGrpc.this.stop();\n                System.err.println(\"*** server shut down\");\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    public void stop() {\n        if (server != null) {\n            server.shutdown();\n        }\n    }\n\n    void blockUntilShutdown() throws InterruptedException {\n        if (server != null) {\n            server.awaitTermination();\n        }\n    }\n\n    private class ServiceImp extends RemoteServiceGrpc.RemoteServiceImplBase {\n        Logger log=Logger.getLogger(ServiceImp.class.getName());\n\n        @Override\n        public void login(Service.LoginUserDTO request, StreamObserver&lt;Service.Response&gt;

The\n  haveged implementation seeds your system's random source (usually\n  /dev/random) using differences in your processor's time stamp counter\n  (TSC) after executing a loop repeatedly</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>How to install haveged</h2>\n\n<p>Follow the steps in this article. <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-additional-entropy-for-cloud-servers-using-haveged\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-additional-entropy-for-cloud-servers-using-haveged</a></p>\n\n<p>I have posted it <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/40603084/6785908\">here</a></p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":288696,"reputation":91230,"user_id":589259,"accept_rate":82,"display_name":"Maarten Bodewes"},"score":1,"creation_date":1545321313,"post_id":40885767,"comment_id":94591222,"body_markdown":"I&#39;d only *allow* `getInstanceStrong()` for long term keys, such as those for TLS certificates.

You can write a simple but practically very adequate (that is, *pragmatic*) detector as follows:\r\n\r\n(note: this is a copy of my comment here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/28111150/773113)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you are not going to be just writing a method which determines whether a class is immutable; instead, you will need to write an immutability detector class, because it is going to have to maintain some state.  The state of the detector will be the detected immutability of all classes which it has examined so far. This is not only useful for performance, but it is actually necessary because a class may contain a circular reference, which would cause a simplistic immutability detector to fall into infinite recursion.\r\n\r\nThe immutability of a class has four possible values: `Unknown`, `Mutable`, `Immutable`, and `Calculating`. You will probably want to have a map which associates each class that you have encountered so far to an immutability value.  Of course, `Unknown` does not actually need to be implemented, since it will be the implied state of any class which is not yet in the map.\r\n\r\nSo, when you begin examining a class, you associate it with a `Calculating` value in the map, and when you are done, you replace `Calculating` with either `Immutable` or `Mutable`.\r\n\r\nFor each class, you only need to check the field members, not the code.  The idea of checking bytecode is rather misguided.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you should **not** check whether a class is final; The finality of a class does not affect its immutability.  Instead, a method which expects an immutable parameter should first of all invoke the immutability detector to assert the immutability of the class of the actual object that was passed. This test can be omitted if the type of the parameter is a final class, so finality is good for performance, but strictly speaking not necessary.  Also, as you will see further down, a field whose type is of a non-final class will cause the declaring class to be considered as mutable, but still, that&#39;s a problem of the declaring class, not the problem of the non-final immutable member class. It is perfectly fine to have a tall hierarchy of immutable classes, in which all the non-leaf nodes must of course be non-final.\r\n\r\nYou should **not** check whether a field is private;  it is perfectly fine for a class to have a public field, and the visibility of the field does not affect the immutability of the declaring class in any way, shape, or form.  You only need to check whether the field is final and its type is immutable.\r\n\r\nWhen examining a class, what you want to do first of all is to recurse to determine the immutability of its `super` class.  If the super is mutable, then the descendant is by definition mutable too.\r\n\r\nThen, you only need to check the *declared* fields of the class, not *all* fields.\r\n\r\nIf a field is non-final, then your class is mutable.\r\n\r\nIf a field is final, but the type of the field is mutable, then your class is mutable. (Arrays are by definition mutable.)\r\n\r\nIf a field is final, and the type of the field is `Calculating`, then ignore it and proceed to the next field.  If all fields are either immutable or `Calculating`, then your class is immutable.\r\n\r\nIf the type of the field is an interface, or an abstract class, or a non-final class, then it is to be considered as mutable, since you have absolutely no control over what the actual implementation may do. This might seem like an insurmountable problem, because it means that wrapping a modifiable collection inside an `UnmodifiableCollection` will still fail the immutability test, but it is actually fine, and it can be handled with the following workaround.\r\n\r\nSome classes may contain non-final fields and still be *effectively immutable*.  An example of this is the `String` class.  Other classes which fall into this category are classes which contain non-final members purely for performance monitoring purposes (invocation counters, etc.), classes which implement *popsicle immutability* (look it up), and classes which contain members that are interfaces which are known to not cause any side effects. Also, if a class contains bona fide mutable fields but promises not to take them into account when computing hashCode() and equals(), then the class is of course unsafe when it comes to multi-threading, but it can still be considered as immutable for the purpose of using it as a key in a map. So, all these cases can be handled in one of two ways:\r\n\r\n1. Manually adding classes (and interfaces) to your immutability detector.  If you know that a certain class is effectively immutable despite the fact that the immutability test for it fails, you can manually add an entry to your detector which associates it with `Immutable`.  This way, the detector will never attempt to check whether it is immutable, it will always just say &#39;yes, it is.&#39;\r\n\r\n2. Introducing an `@ImmutabilityOverride` annotation.  Your immutability detector can check for the presence of this annotation on a field, and if present, it may treat the field as immutable despite the fact that the field may be non-final or its type may be mutable. The detector may also check for the presence of this annotation on the class, thus treating the class as immutable without even bothering to check its fields.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps future generations.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr/&gt;\r\n\r\n***EDIT in 2023***\r\n\r\nI ended up writing a library called ***Bathyscaphe*** that implements all of the above. Although indeed a lot more simple than MutabilityDetector, it ended up being far more complicated than I imagined, so I would strongly recommend that you use this library instead of attempting to implement the above by yourself.\r\n\r\nBathyscaphe can be found here: https://github.com/mikenakis/Bathyscaphe \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, static analysis tools such as MutabilityDetector (see Grundlefleck&#39;s answer) can be useful at certain times and under certain scenarios, but they do not (and cannot) provide a complete solution to the problem at all times. A complete solution requires runtime checking as I explain on my blog here: https://blog.michael.gr/2022/05/bathyscaphe.html, and that&#39;s why I have written Bathyscaphe.\r\n\r\nTo address the concern expressed by Martin Probst in his answer to this question, Bathyscaphe will also help you check for thread-safety, although this branch of checks relies heavily on annotations that you add to your code, so naturally, Bathyscaphe will only give correct answers if the annotations are correct. But it is still better than coding in the dark.","title":"How do I identify immutable objects in Java","body":"<p>I appreciate and admire the amount of work Grundlefleck has put into his mutability detector, but I think it is a bit of an overkill.

Your immutability detector can check for the presence of this annotation on a field, and if present, it may treat the field as immutable despite the fact that the field may be non-final or its type may be mutable. The detector may also check for the presence of this annotation on the class, thus treating the class as immutable without even bothering to check its fields.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope this helps future generations.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em><strong>EDIT in 2023</strong></em></p>\n<p>I ended up writing a library called <em><strong>Bathyscaphe</strong></em> that implements all of the above. Although indeed a lot more simple than MutabilityDetector, it ended up being far more complicated than I imagined, so I would strongly recommend that you use this library instead of attempting to implement the above by yourself.</p>\n<p>Bathyscaphe can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/mikenakis/Bathyscaphe\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/mikenakis/Bathyscaphe</a></p>\n<p>In my opinion, static analysis tools such as MutabilityDetector (see Grundlefleck's answer) can be useful at certain times and under certain scenarios, but they do not (and cannot) provide a complete solution to the problem at all times. A complete solution requires runtime checking as I explain on my blog here: <a href=\"https://blog.michael.gr/2022/05/bathyscaphe.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://blog.michael.gr/2022/05/bathyscaphe.html</a>, and that's why I have written Bathyscaphe.</p>\n<p>To address the concern expressed by Martin Probst in his answer to this question, Bathyscaphe will also help you check for thread-safety, although this branch of checks relies heavily on annotations that you add to your code, so naturally, Bathyscaphe will only give correct answers if the annotations are correct. But it is still better than coding in the dark.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":8175,"reputation":24189,"user_id":14570,"accept_rate":81,"display_name":"mcherm"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28129,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":48,"accepted_answer_id":203571,"answer_count":14,"score":47,"last_activity_date":1683639265,"creation_date":1224035700,"question_id":203475,"body_markdown":"In my code, I am creating a collection of objects which will be accessed by various threads in a fashion that is only safe if the objects are immutable.

The state of the detector will be the detected immutability of all classes which it has examined so far. This is not only useful for performance, but it is actually necessary because a class may contain a circular reference, which would cause a simplistic immutability detector to fall into infinite recursion.\r\n\r\nThe immutability of a class has four possible values: `Unknown`, `Mutable`, `Immutable`, and `Calculating`. You will probably want to have a map which associates each class that you have encountered so far to an immutability value.  Of course, `Unknown` does not actually need to be implemented, since it will be the implied state of any class which is not yet in the map.\r\n\r\nSo, when you begin examining a class, you associate it with a `Calculating` value in the map, and when you are done, you replace `Calculating` with either `Immutable` or `Mutable`.\r\n\r\nFor each class, you only need to check the field members, not the code.  The idea of checking bytecode is rather misguided.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you should **not** check whether a class is final; The finality of a class does not affect its immutability.  Instead, a method which expects an immutable parameter should first of all invoke the immutability detector to assert the immutability of the class of the actual object that was passed. This test can be omitted if the type of the parameter is a final class, so finality is good for performance, but strictly speaking not necessary.  Also, as you will see further down, a field whose type is of a non-final class will cause the declaring class to be considered as mutable, but still, that&#39;s a problem of the declaring class, not the problem of the non-final immutable member class. It is perfectly fine to have a tall hierarchy of immutable classes, in which all the non-leaf nodes must of course be non-final.\r\n\r\nYou should **not** check whether a field is private;  it is perfectly fine for a class to have a public field, and the visibility of the field does not affect the immutability of the declaring class in any way, shape, or form.  You only need to check whether the field is final and its type is immutable.\r\n\r\nWhen examining a class, what you want to do first of all is to recurse to determine the immutability of its `super` class.  If the super is mutable, then the descendant is by definition mutable too.\r\n\r\nThen, you only need to check the *declared* fields of the class, not *all* fields.\r\n\r\nIf a field is non-final, then your class is mutable.\r\n\r\nIf a field is final, but the type of the field is mutable, then your class is mutable. (Arrays are by definition mutable.)\r\n\r\nIf a field is final, and the type of the field is `Calculating`, then ignore it and proceed to the next field.  If all fields are either immutable or `Calculating`, then your class is immutable.\r\n\r\nIf the type of the field is an interface, or an abstract class, or a non-final class, then it is to be considered as mutable, since you have absolutely no control over what the actual implementation may do. This might seem like an insurmountable problem, because it means that wrapping a modifiable collection inside an `UnmodifiableCollection` will still fail the immutability test, but it is actually fine, and it can be handled with the following workaround.\r\n\r\nSome classes may contain non-final fields and still be *effectively immutable*.  An example of this is the `String` class.  Other classes which fall into this category are classes which contain non-final members purely for performance monitoring purposes (invocation counters, etc.), classes which implement *popsicle immutability* (look it up), and classes which contain members that are interfaces which are known to not cause any side effects. Also, if a class contains bona fide mutable fields but promises not to take them into account when computing hashCode() and equals(), then the class is of course unsafe when it comes to multi-threading, but it can still be considered as immutable for the purpose of using it as a key in a map. So, all these cases can be handled in one of two ways:\r\n\r\n1. Manually adding classes (and interfaces) to your immutability detector.  If you know that a certain class is effectively immutable despite the fact that the immutability test for it fails, you can manually add an entry to your detector which associates it with `Immutable`.  This way, the detector will never attempt to check whether it is immutable, it will always just say &#39;yes, it is.&#39;\r\n\r\n2. Introducing an `@ImmutabilityOverride` annotation.  Your immutability detector can check for the presence of this annotation on a field, and if present, it may treat the field as immutable despite the fact that the field may be non-final or its type may be mutable. The detector may also check for the presence of this annotation on the class, thus treating the class as immutable without even bothering to check its fields.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps future generations.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr/&gt;\r\n\r\n***EDIT in 2023***\r\n\r\nI ended up writing a library that implements all of the above.\r\n\r\nYou can find it here: https://github.com/mikenakis/Bathyscaphe \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, static analysis tools such as MutabilityDetector (see Grundlefleck&#39;s answer) can be useful at certain times and under certain scenarios, but they do not (and cannot) provide a complete solution to the problem at all times.

Divide your design into different sections, and use LinearLayout for each section and within each section, and include elements belonging to that section.\r\n\r\n```lang-xml\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n&lt;LinearLayout\r\n    android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n    android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n    xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;\r\n    android:orientation=&quot;horizontal&quot;\r\n    &gt;\r\n    &lt;LinearLayout\r\n        android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n        android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n        android:layout_weight=&quot;.25&quot;\r\n        android:orientation=&quot;vertical&quot;\r\n        &gt;\r\n        &lt;TextView\r\n            android:id=&quot;@+id/title&quot;\r\n            android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n            android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n            android:textColor=&quot;#E35B5B&quot;\r\n            android:fontFamily=&quot;Cabin-Regular&quot;\r\n            android:textSize=&quot;14dp&quot;\r\n            android:layout_weight=&quot;0.33&quot;\r\n            android:singleLine=&quot;true&quot;\r\n            android:ellipsize=&quot;end&quot;\r\n            android:gravity=&quot;center|left&quot;\r\n            android:paddingLeft=&quot;10dp&quot;\r\n            android:text=&quot;Google&quot;\r\n            /&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;TextView\r\n            android:id=&quot;@+id/desc&quot;\r\n            android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n            android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n            android:textColor=&quot;#2D2D2D&quot;\r\n            android:fontFamily=&quot;Cabin-Regular&quot;\r\n            android:textSize=&quot;16dp&quot;\r\n            android:layout_weight=&quot;0.33&quot;\r\n            android:singleLine=&quot;true&quot;\r\n            android:ellipsize=&quot;end&quot;\r\n            android:gravity=&quot;center|left&quot;\r\n            android:paddingLeft=&quot;10dp&quot;\r\n            android:text=&quot;Google is a Search engine&quot;\r\n            /&gt;\r\n        &lt;TextView\r\n            android:id=&quot;@+id/url_view&quot;\r\n            android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n            android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n            android:layout_below=&quot;@+id/title&quot;\r\n            android:textColor=&quot;#BDBDBD&quot;\r\n            android:textSize=&quot;10dp&quot;\r\n            android:layout_weight=&quot;0.33&quot;\r\n            android:singleLine=&quot;true&quot;\r\n            android:ellipsize=&quot;end&quot;\r\n            android:gravity=&quot;center|left&quot;\r\n            android:paddingLeft=&quot;10dp&quot;\r\n            android:text=&quot;http://www.google.com&quot;\r\n            /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/LinearLayout&gt;\r\n    &lt;LinearLayout\r\n        android:layout_width=&quot;110dp&quot;\r\n        android:layout_height=&quot;110dp&quot;\r\n\r\n        &gt;\r\n        &lt;ImageView\r\n            android:id=&quot;@+id/icon&quot;\r\n            android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n            android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n\r\n            /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/LinearLayout&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n","title":"How to align title, description and URL in an equal space","body":"<p>Here is the code.

(You would need to cast the `EntityManager` to `Session`.)\r\n\r\nBut even this is not necessary. Relational databases are meant to serve many different clients in a distributed system at the same time.

The database uses types for which JPA/Hibernate do not have a matching builtin type (example: ltree), so my idea is to use a UserType.\r\n\r\nI have created an LTreeType.java class implementing the UserType interface.
