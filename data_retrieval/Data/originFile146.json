(I also tried the same modifying the action up event too, same result)</p>\n<p>Here is the buttonContainer onTouch:</p>\n<pre><code>private void setupButtonTouchListeners() {\n        mButtonsContainer.setOnTouchListener(new View.OnTouchListener() {\n            @Override\n            public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {\n                boolean buttonActionPerformed = false;\n                int action = event.getActionMasked();\n                int pointerIndex = event.getActionIndex(); // Index of the pointer that triggered the event\n                int pointerId = event.getPointerId(pointerIndex); // Get the pointer ID\n                switch (action) {\n                    case MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN:\n                    case MotionEvent.ACTION_POINTER_DOWN:\n                        // Handle button pressed event\n                        for (CustomButton button : mButtons) {\n                            if (button.isWithinButtonBounds(event, pointerIndex)) {\n                                if (button.setPressed(true, pointerId)) {\n                                    buttonActionPerformed = true;\n                                }\n                            }\n                        }\n                        break;\n                    case MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE:\n                        for (int i = 0; i &lt; event.getPointerCount(); i++) {\n                            int currentPointerId = event.getPointerId(i);\n                            for (CustomButton button : mButtons) {\n                                if (button.isWithinButtonBounds(event, i)) {\n                                    if (button.setPressed(true, currentPointerId)) {\n                                        buttonActionPerformed = true;\n                                    }\n                                } else {\n                                    if (joystickMode) {\n                                        if (button.setPressed(false, currentPointerId)) {\n                                            Log.i(&quot;APPLOG&quot;, &quot;ACTION UP EVENT action preformed&quot;);\n                                            buttonActionPerformed = true;\n                                        }\n                                    }\n                                }\n                            }\n                        }\n                        break;\n                    case MotionEvent.ACTION_UP:\n                    case MotionEvent.ACTION_POINTER_UP:\n                    case MotionEvent.ACTION_CANCEL:\n                        for (CustomButton button : mButtons) {\n                            if (button.setPressed(false, pointerId)) {\n                                //Log.i(&quot;APPLOG&quot;, &quot;ACTION UP EVENT action preformed&quot;);\n                                buttonActionPerformed = true;\n                            }\n                        }\n                        if (!buttonActionPerformed) {\n                            Log.i(&quot;APPLOG&quot;, &quot;Up press no action on pointer: &quot; + event.getPointerId(pointerIndex));\n                        }\n                        break;\n                }\n\n                if (buttonActionPerformed) {\n                    //Log.i(&quot;APPLOG&quot;, &quot;ACTION preformed&quot;);\n                    return true; // Consume the touch event\n                } else {\n                    //Log.i(&quot;APPLOG&quot;, &quot;No action at all&quot;);\n                    return false; // Let the touch propagate to the WebView\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>button.setPressed</code> method just returns whether an action was preformed on a button.

If it does not obtain the lock after waiting for 5 seconds, another set of logic will be executed.</p>\n<p>This set of code has almost no errors, because lock.unlock() is only executed if lock.tryLock(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS) returns true.</p>\n<p>However, for certain business peak hours, the above exceptions sometimes occur. The specific performance is that many tasks report errors: java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException: attempt to unlock, not locked by current thread by node id: SameId thread id: DifferentThreadId.The above error reports occur in a centralized manner. Many threads release the same lock within a few seconds.</p>\n<p>Is this caused by network?

There is no difference in calling `LogManager#readConfiguration(InputStream)` or setting the `java.util.logging.config.file` property and calling `LogManager#readConfiguration()`.\r\n\r\nNow see the next output, when I run the same code with the VM property `-Djava.util.logging.config.file=/tmp/logging.properties` :\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-java --&gt;\r\n\r\n    --- start\r\n    2012-11-09 10:03:44.0838 SEVERE  [test.A#main()] - SEVERE 1\r\n    2012-11-09 10:03:44.0843 FINEST  [test.A#main()] - FINEST 1\r\n    --- end\r\n\r\nAs you can see, both the SEVERE and the FINEST levels are logged and they are logged in a different format.

Also, just as in the example above, calling `LogManager#readConfiguration(InputStream)` doesn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nSo what is the problem? According to the [javadoc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/logging/LogManager.html) setting the java.util.logging.config.file property at runtime should work.

Whenever I am trying to reread the configuration, logging is disabled at all.</p>\n\n<p>See the following code snippet:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>package test;\n\nimport java.io.FileInputStream;\nimport java.util.logging.Level;\nimport java.util.logging.LogManager;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\npublic class A {\n  private static final Logger LOGGER= Logger.getLogger(A.class.getName());\n\n  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n    System.out.println(\"--- start\");\n    LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, \"SEVERE 1\");\n    LOGGER.log(Level.FINEST, \"FINEST 1\");\n    LogManager.getLogManager().readConfiguration();\n    LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, \"SEVERE 2\");\n    LOGGER.log(Level.FINEST, \"FINEST 2\");\n    LogManager.getLogManager().readConfiguration(new FileInputStream(\"/tmp/logging.properties\"));\n    LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, \"SEVERE 3\");\n    LOGGER.log(Level.FINEST, \"FINEST 3\");\n    System.out.println(\"--- end\");\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is the output if I run the class without any VM argument:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>--- start\n09.11.2012 09:59:25 test.A main\nSCHWERWIEGEND: SEVERE 1\n09.11.2012 09:59:25 test.A main\nSCHWERWIEGEND: SEVERE 2\n--- end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, only the SEVERE levels are logged, as this is the default of the JREs logging.properties. Calling <code>LogManager#readConfiguration()</code> doesn't change anything. But when trying to read the configuration from my logging.properties, absolutely nothing is logged. There is no difference in calling <code>LogManager#readConfiguration(InputStream)</code> or setting the <code>java.util.logging.config.file</code> property and calling <code>LogManager#readConfiguration()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now see the next output, when I run the same code with the VM property <code>-Djava.util.logging.config.file=/tmp/logging.properties</code> :\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>--- start\n2012-11-09 10:03:44.0838 SEVERE  [test.A#main()] - SEVERE 1\n2012-11-09 10:03:44.0843 FINEST  [test.A#main()] - FINEST 1\n--- end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, both the SEVERE and the FINEST levels are logged and they are logged in a different format. Both is specified in my custom <code>logging.properties</code>.\nBut logging stops here after calling <code>LogManager#readConfiguration()</code>! This is different from the example above and I don't understand it. Also, just as in the example above, calling <code>LogManager#readConfiguration(InputStream)</code> doesn't work.</p>\n\n<p>So what is the problem? According to the <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/logging/LogManager.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">javadoc</a> setting the java.util.logging.config.file property at runtime should work.

The project is currently running on version 2.2.11.RELEASE. However, I encountered a roadblock when I realized that there is no Azure Service Bus library support for this version. Azure Service Bus support begins from version 2.5.0 and above.
