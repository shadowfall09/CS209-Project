So forking and tagging the GitHub repository should work as a workaround, right?"}],"owner":{"account_id":3736112,"reputation":988,"user_id":3107019,"display_name":"JackPGreen"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":476,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1646612373,"creation_date":1646414341,"question_id":71354978,"body_markdown":"I have a large Eclipse RCP application with lots of transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nCurrently, these are manually copied into the classpath but that&#39;s a significant administrative overhead I&#39;d like to avoid, and would instead like to use Maven, as [discussed here][1].\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve created [a simple RCP application][2].\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve created a `target-platform.target`, which imports the RCP dependencies and my Maven dependency:\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

It&#39;s hard to predict the number though, because the [JIT compilation policy](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35614237/3448419) is quite complex, involving many factors.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s consider a simplified example:\r\n```\r\npublic class Test {\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        // Uncomment the following line to see the difference\r\n        // args.hashCode();\r\n\r\n        int exceptionCount = 0;\r\n        while (true) {\r\n            try {\r\n                ((Object) null).hashCode();\r\n            } catch (Exception e) {\r\n                exceptionCount++;\r\n                if (e.getStackTrace().length == 0) {\r\n                    System.out.println(exceptionCount);\r\n                    break;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt prints a number close to 115000, like in your test. The variance is explained by the fact that JIT compilation runs in the background, i.e. while a method is being compiled, it continues execution in the interpreter or at a lower tier.\r\n\r\nTo eliminate this variance, let&#39;s run it with background compilation disabled: `-Xbatch`.  \r\nNow the output becomes stable: **106496**. Why so?\r\n\r\n1. `Test.main` starts running in the interpreter. Every 1024 loop iterations (2&lt;sup&gt;Tier0BackedgeNotifyFreqLog&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; = 1024) the interpreter invokes JIT compilation policy to see if a method needs to be compiled.\r\n2. As soon as the number of iterations exceeds 60000 (`-XX:Tier3BackEdgeThreshold`), the method is compiled at tier 3 (C1 with profiling). Given 1024 step, this happens after 1024*59 = 60416 iterations.\r\n3. A method compiled at tier 3 invokes JIT policy much less often than the interpreter - more precisely, once in 8192 iterations (2&lt;sup&gt;Tier3BackedgeNotifyFreqLog&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;).\r\n4. After 40000 more loop iterations (`-XX:Tier4BackEdgeThreshold`), the method becomes eligible for recompilation at tier 4. In our case, this happens exactly after 8192*5 = 40960 iterations.\r\n5. Initially, C2-compiled method doesn&#39;t include a fast path for throwing `NullPointerException`. The first invocation of a method on `null` object results in the uncommon trap, and the execution falls back to the interpreter.\r\n6. Like in (1), the interpreter invokes the compilation policy again after 1024 loop iterations.\r\n7. Compilation policy recognizes the method as hot and installs previously compiled C2 version, which immediately results in a new uncommon trap due to NPE.\r\n8. Steps (5)-(7) are then repeated 4 times (`-XX:PerBytecodeTrapLimit`). After exceeding the limit, on the 5th attempt, the method is finally recompiled with a fast path for NPE. This &quot;fast&quot; NPE no longer has a stack trace.\r\n\r\nThe total number of loop iterations throughout the above life cycle is\r\n```\r\n60416 + 40960 + 5*1024 = 106496\r\n```\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, if I uncomment `args.hashCode()` call, the number of iterations will drop to **40961**. Why?\r\n\r\nEven though the line looks unrelated, it affects the constant pool resolution. Both `args.hashCode()` and `((Object) null).hashCode()` refer to the same `CONSTANT_Methodref_info` in the constant pool. The first successful method invocation resolves this constant pool entry.\r\n\r\nIf a Methodref is unresolved and receiver is `null`, HotSpot JVM throws `NullPointerException` right during resolution of `invoke` instruction:\r\n\r\n[![unresolved.png][1]][1]\r\n\r\nBut in the case of a resolved Methodref, JVM throws `NullPointerException` from a different place in the code. This another path records the fact of a thrown exception in the `MethodData` structure:\r\n\r\n[![resolved.png][2]][2]\r\n\r\n`MethodData` is a JVM structure that holds method&#39;s runtime profile to be used for JIT compilation. The presense of the profile makes JVM compile the method directly at tier 4 (because there is no need to collect profile at tier 3, if it was already collected in the interpreter).\r\n\r\nIn this case, when a number of loop iterations reaches 40000 (`-XX:Tier4BackEdgeThreshold`), the method is scheduled for compilation at tier 4. But since the feedback step is 1024 (2&lt;sup&gt;Tier0BackedgeNotifyFreqLog&lt;/sup&gt;), the actual number of iterations before JIT compilation is 40*1024 = 40960.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nGetting back to your original example. When `ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(2) == 0` is true, `hashCode()` is successfully resolved and executed. Subsequent NPEs are thrown from `invokevirtual` implementation, and as a side effect, JVM creates `MethodData` for the `main` method. When the number of loop iterations exceeds 40000 (half of them resulting in a normal call, and half in a thrown exception), the method gets compiled by C2 with `OmitStackTraceInFastThrow` optimization. Hence a little more than 20000 exceptions before the optimization.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, `ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt() == 0` is almost never true. Therefore `hashCode()` call never succeeds: NPE is thrown while resolving the constant pool entry, and the entry remains unresolved. That&#39;s why the method is first compiled by C1 (after 60K iterations), then recompiled by C2 (after 40K more iterations). So the method throws more than 100K exceptions in total before `OmitStackTraceInFastThrow` optimization takes place.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/yW4Xa.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/cGGMU.png","title":"How is the count of method executions that triggers the omitted exception stack frames calculated in JDK 8?","body":"<p>It's indeed interesting why a small change causes such a big difference, however, the answer is not simple at all.</p>\n<p>First off, a Java method may run in the interpreter or get JIT compiled.

This &quot;fast&quot; NPE no longer has a stack trace.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The total number of loop iterations throughout the above life cycle is</p>\n<pre><code>60416 + 40960 + 5*1024 = 106496\n</code></pre>\n<p>Surprisingly, if I uncomment <code>args.hashCode()</code> call, the number of iterations will drop to <strong>40961</strong>. Why?</p>\n<p>Even though the line looks unrelated, it affects the constant pool resolution. Both <code>args.hashCode()</code> and <code>((Object) null).hashCode()</code> refer to the same <code>CONSTANT_Methodref_info</code> in the constant pool. The first successful method invocation resolves this constant pool entry.</p>\n<p>If a Methodref is unresolved and receiver is <code>null</code>, HotSpot JVM throws <code>NullPointerException</code> right during resolution of <code>invoke</code> instruction:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yW4Xa.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yW4Xa.png\" alt=\"unresolved.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>But in the case of a resolved Methodref, JVM throws <code>NullPointerException</code> from a different place in the code. This another path records the fact of a thrown exception in the <code>MethodData</code> structure:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cGGMU.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cGGMU.png\" alt=\"resolved.png\" /></a></p>\n<p><code>MethodData</code> is a JVM structure that holds method's runtime profile to be used for JIT compilation. The presense of the profile makes JVM compile the method directly at tier 4 (because there is no need to collect profile at tier 3, if it was already collected in the interpreter).</p>\n<p>In this case, when a number of loop iterations reaches 40000 (<code>-XX:Tier4BackEdgeThreshold</code>), the method is scheduled for compilation at tier 4. But since the feedback step is 1024 (2<sup>Tier0BackedgeNotifyFreqLog</sup>), the actual number of iterations before JIT compilation is 40*1024 = 40960.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Getting back to your original example. When <code>ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(2) == 0</code> is true, <code>hashCode()</code> is successfully resolved and executed. Subsequent NPEs are thrown from <code>invokevirtual</code> implementation, and as a side effect, JVM creates <code>MethodData</code> for the <code>main</code> method. When the number of loop iterations exceeds 40000 (half of them resulting in a normal call, and half in a thrown exception), the method gets compiled by C2 with <code>OmitStackTraceInFastThrow</code> optimization. Hence a little more than 20000 exceptions before the optimization.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, <code>ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt() == 0</code> is almost never true. Therefore <code>hashCode()</code> call never succeeds: NPE is thrown while resolving the constant pool entry, and the entry remains unresolved. That's why the method is first compiled by C1 (after 60K iterations), then recompiled by C2 (after 40K more iterations). So the method throws more than 100K exceptions in total before <code>OmitStackTraceInFastThrow</code> optimization takes place.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":7909307,"reputation":409,"user_id":5973816,"display_name":"Poison"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":246,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":71375155,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1646610905,"creation_date":1646200297,"question_id":71318011,"body_markdown":"JDK

Both represent a moment in UTC, always in UTC. (Despite `Date::toString` lying to you, in applying the JVM’s current default time zone.)\r\n\r\n    Instant instant = Instant.now() ;  // Capture current moment in UTC.\r\n\r\nAdjust into a time zone.\r\n\r\n    ZoneId z = ZoneId.of( &quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot; ) ;\r\n    ZonedDateTime zdt = instant.atZone( z ) ;\r\n\r\nAdjust into another time zone. \r\n\r\n    ZoneId zKolkata = ZoneId.of( &quot;Asia/Kolkata&quot; ) ;  // Contemporary time in India. \r\n    ZonedDateTime zdtKolkata = instant.atZone( zKolkata ) ;\r\n\r\nAll three objects (`instant`, `zdt`, &amp; `zdtKolkata`) represent **the very same simultaneous moment**, the same point on the timeline. Only the wall-clock time is different. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Strings\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen generating strings representing date-time values, I recommend always including the offset/zone information unless the context is absolutely crystal-clear. I have seen much confusion in the business world caused by reports where the time frame was ambiguous. \r\n\r\nBut if you insist, either define your own formatting pattern with `DateTimeFormatter` class, or use the given formatter [`ISO_LOCAL_DATE_TIME`][1] and replace the `T` in the middle with a SPACE.\r\n\r\n    DateTimeFormatter f = DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_DATE_TIME ;\r\n    String output = zdt.format( f ) ;\r\n\r\n&gt;2013-01-17 21:01:55\r\n\r\n# Unzoned date-time\r\n\r\nPart of the problem is the ambiguity of your string `2013-01-17 21:01:55`. That string lacks any indicator of time zone or offset-from-UTC. Such a value is *not* a moment, is *not* a point on the timeline. For example, 9 PM in India comes several hours sooner than 9 PM in Qu&#233;bec. Without a zone or offset, that string represents only *potential* moments along a range of about 26-27 hours, the range of time zones around the globe.\r\n\r\nThe legacy classes had no such class to represent this kind of value. In the modern classes, we have `LocalDateTime` for this purpose, a non-moment, date and time-of-day without zone/offset.\r\n\r\nThe *java.time* classes use ISO 8601 standard formats by default when parsing/generating strings. Your input nearly complies. We need only replace the &lt;span style=&#39;text-transform: small-caps;&#39;&gt;SPACE&lt;/span&gt; in the middle with a `T`. \r\n\r\n    LocalDateTime ldt = LocalDateTime.parse( &quot;2013-01-17 21:01:55&quot;.replace( &quot;&quot; , &quot;T&quot; ) ) ;\r\n\r\nIf you know for a fact that the intent behind that string was to represent a moment in a particular time zone, apply a `ZoneId` to get a `ZonedDateTime`. For example, if you are certain it represents a moment on most of the west coast of North America, use `America/Los_Angeles`. \r\n\r\n    ZoneId z = ZoneId.of( &quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot; ) ;\r\n    ZonedDateTime zdt = ldt.atZone( z ) ; \r\n\r\nTo adjust from that zone to UTC, extract a `Instant` object. The [`Instant`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html) class represents a moment on the timeline in [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) with a resolution of [nanoseconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosecond) (up to nine (9) digits of a decimal fraction). \r\n\r\n    Instant instant = zdt.toInstant() ;  // Adjust from some zone to UTC.

I will provide something that I think could work at the end though.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing I noticed is that your long series of conditionals involves a lot of brackets and you may have missed one as you nested many of them into each other. I did a thorough check and really, the only one I did not see was the one that should end the boolean method after `return isTrueDate;` so I thought I should mention it just in case. To be clear, you probably have it, but make sure you have a bracket that closes the method. Also in the future, make sure to put the whole code snippet for clarity. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nNow the second thing I see is the way you got the validation. I do not know exactly what you mean when you say `validation = v.checkDate(ticketDate);` in the first code snippet because I do not know what v is, although I will assume it is the main class. In this case, while I am not sure, it looks like you are trying to run your method and assign the boolean value of whether the date is a real date to the value of validation. This makes sense, but what I think you should change is how you used `isTrueDate` to verify by asking if the value is not `isTrueDate`. I think it might solve an issue if you simply put an invalid response on `validation` being false and vice versa for `validation` being true. Here&#39;s an example:\r\n\r\n        validation = v.checkDate(ticketDate);\r\n        if (validation == true) {\r\n          //Something here if you want.\r\n          //However you may not need this space.\r\n        } else {\r\n          System.out.println(&quot;invalid&quot;)\r\n        }\r\n\r\nHowever, with this, there are really two approaches that I can think of: the one that preserves security and the one that ensures your code is working.\r\nSo the code above is better at preserving security b/c it accounts for anything that may not make the validation false in the else statement in addition to it being false because your code worked properly. For example, if your series of conditionals has a flaw in it, b/c you initialized validation as being false, if something goes wrong, its likely to just invalidate the ticket, which could be semi-useful in a security sense to avoid some vulnerabilities. However, you can do that later. The first thing you need to make sure of is that your code works properly, so I would also recommend that when you declare validate at the top of your first code snippet, to not initialize it.\r\n\r\nLike this:\r\n\r\n    boolean validation;\r\n\r\nInstead of this:\r\n\r\n    boolean validation = false;\r\n\r\nThis ensures that your series of conditionals is responsible for the value of `validation` rather than the conditions simply not working and the value being false by default.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to another thing that I believe would also cause problems in your code. \r\nIt refers to this section from your first code snippet:\r\n\r\n        boolean isTrueDate = true;\r\n        System.out.println();\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Transaction Id: &quot; + random_int);\r\n        int transactionId = random_int;\r\n\r\nSo two things: \r\n - The easy one refers to the bottom two lines. It&#39;s not a mistake causing you errors, but I would suggest switching the order of the bottom two lines to assign `transactionId` to the value of `random_int` and then printing:\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Transaction Id: &quot; + transactionId);\r\n\r\n - Now the second one is the real problem. In the code above you are assigning true to `isTrueDate`.\r\nThis is a problem because you are later using `isTrueDate` in that series of conditionals in that other boolean method called `checkDate()`\r\nThis will mess up your code. Here is how:\r\n\r\n - So first the `isTrueDate` you used inside your method, `checkDate()` is kept local to that method because you declared it inside there. If you did not do this, you likely would have gotten a separate error because you declared a boolean `isTrueDate` in two separate places. You declared it at the top in that first code snippet, and you declared it in that method. Normally, this would cause an error because you have already declared it once and changing the value would only require you to assign `isTrueDate` to something else with an equal sign rather than declaring it again. To really show you what I mean, look at this example:\r\n\r\nIncorrect:\r\n\r\n    boolean isTrueDate = true;\r\n    //Other actions\r\n    //I want to change the value of isTrueDate\r\n    boolean isTrueDate = false;\r\n\r\nCorrect:\r\n\r\n    boolean isTrueDate = true;\r\n    //Other actions\r\n    //I want to change the value of isTrueDate\r\n    isTrueDate = false;\r\n\r\nWhat you did (doesn&#39;t return error but messes up your code):\r\nI put it in a different order to better show the problem.\r\n   \r\n    public static boolean checkDate(String ticketDate) {\r\n        boolean isTrueDate = true; //first declaration\r\n\r\n    //Lots of conditions\r\n    }\r\n    static void someMethod() {\r\n\r\n    //This method may not be exactly how you did it, \r\n    //but you did not show me that.\r\n\r\n        boolean isTrueDate = true; //usually invalid second declaration. \r\n        //However, it still works b/c they are in different methods and\r\n        // thus kept separate from each other. This still messes up your\r\n        // code though\r\n\r\n        //more code\r\n        validation = v.checkDate(ticketDate);\r\n        if (!isTrueDate) {\r\n          System.out.println(&quot;Invalid&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n          //Doesn&#39;t work b/c the value of isTrueDate you initialized\r\n          // in someMethod() is the one that this if else statement checks \r\n          // instead of the one that you used in checkDate()\r\n          //That means, isTrueDate will always be true.\r\n\r\n        //To solve this, you must first use validation to present the\r\n        // invalid message as discussed above, but furthermore, you should\r\n        // delete the initialization of isTrueDate in the method that is\r\n        // not checkDate() because you don&#39;t need it there. \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nSorry, that&#39;s a lot to explain, and there may be more to fix, but I have one more correction for now: I looked through the conditionals that you used to account for all the ways a date could be correct or incorrect and I think its pretty good for the most part, but I can offer one thing that will save you some lines. \r\nEvery time you check if a date is within the max number of days for that month, you then put a separate `else if` condition that accounts for the other of the two possibilities. Here&#39;s an example from your code:\r\n\r\n    if (day &lt;= 31) {\r\n        isTrueDate = true;\r\n    } else if (day &gt;= 31) {\r\n        isTrueDate = false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis does help to show exactly what is happening, but I would still advise deleting this `else if` part and replacing it with one big `else {}` part at the end because it would say the same thing as all of these other separate `else if` blocks, just much more concisely. Here is what that would look like:\r\n\r\n    \r\n    //This new list of conditions will work such that it finds every true\r\n    // possibility and denies everything else.\r\n\r\n    if (month &lt; 12) //Changed to fit new strategy\r\n    {\r\n        if (month == 1 || month == 3 || month == 5 || month == 7 || month == 8 || month == 10 || month == 12)\r\n        {\r\n            if (day &lt;= 31)\r\n            {\r\n                isTrueDate = true;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        } else if (month == 4 || month == 6 || month == 9 || month == 11) \r\n        {\r\n            if (day &lt;= 30)\r\n            {\r\n                isTrueDate = true;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        } else if (month == 2) // February check\r\n        {\r\n            if (year % 4 == 0) // Leap year check for February\r\n            {\r\n                if (day &lt;= 29)\r\n                {\r\n                    isTrueDate = true;\r\n                }\r\n            } else if (year % 4 != 0)\r\n            {\r\n                if (day &lt;= 28)\r\n                {\r\n                    isTrueDate = true;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    } else { // All the times it was false\r\n            isTrueDate = false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return isTrueDate;\r\n\r\nSo there you have it. As thorough as I could because in truth, this is my first answered question and I wanted to do it right. I hope it helps in some way.

Closes the method\r\n\r\nPeace &lt;3","title":"My validation with true/false statements is not working properly","body":"<p>I am new to this site too, but I can try to give you a response that may help.\nThis is going to be a long one, as I have a lot of potential issues to solve. I will provide something that I think could work at the end though.</p>\n<p>The first thing I noticed is that your long series of conditionals involves a lot of brackets and you may have missed one as you nested many of them into each other. I did a thorough check and really, the only one I did not see was the one that should end the boolean method after <code>return isTrueDate;</code> so I thought I should mention it just in case. To be clear, you probably have it, but make sure you have a bracket that closes the method. Also in the future, make sure to put the whole code snippet for clarity. Thanks in advance.</p>\n<p>Now the second thing I see is the way you got the validation. I do not know exactly what you mean when you say <code>validation = v.checkDate(ticketDate);</code> in the first code snippet because I do not know what v is, although I will assume it is the main class. In this case, while I am not sure, it looks like you are trying to run your method and assign the boolean value of whether the date is a real date to the value of validation. This makes sense, but what I think you should change is how you used <code>isTrueDate</code> to verify by asking if the value is not <code>isTrueDate</code>. I think it might solve an issue if you simply put an invalid response on <code>validation</code> being false and vice versa for <code>validation</code> being true. Here's an example:</p>\n<pre><code>    validation = v.checkDate(ticketDate);\n    if (validation == true) {\n      //Something here if you want.\n      //However you may not need this space.\n    } else {\n      System.out.println(&quot;invalid&quot;)\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, with this, there are really two approaches that I can think of: the one that preserves security and the one that ensures your code is working.\nSo the code above is better at preserving security b/c it accounts for anything that may not make the validation false in the else statement in addition to it being false because your code worked properly. For example, if your series of conditionals has a flaw in it, b/c you initialized validation as being false, if something goes wrong, its likely to just invalidate the ticket, which could be semi-useful in a security sense to avoid some vulnerabilities. However, you can do that later. The first thing you need to make sure of is that your code works properly, so I would also recommend that when you declare validate at the top of your first code snippet, to not initialize it.</p>\n<p>Like this:</p>\n<pre><code>boolean validation;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Instead of this:</p>\n<pre><code>boolean validation = false;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This ensures that your series of conditionals is responsible for the value of <code>validation</code> rather than the conditions simply not working and the value being false by default.</p>\n<p>This brings me to another thing that I believe would also cause problems in your code.\nIt refers to this section from your first code snippet:</p>\n<pre><code>    boolean isTrueDate = true;\n    System.out.println();\n\n    System.out.println(&quot;Transaction Id: &quot; + random_int);\n    int transactionId = random_int;\n</code></pre>\n<p>So two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The easy one refers to the bottom two lines. It's not a mistake causing you errors, but I would suggest switching the order of the bottom two lines to assign <code>transactionId</code> to the value of <code>random_int</code> and then printing:</p>\n<p>System.out.println(&quot;Transaction Id: &quot; + transactionId);</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Now the second one is the real problem. In the code above you are assigning true to <code>isTrueDate</code>.\nThis is a problem because you are later using <code>isTrueDate</code> in that series of conditionals in that other boolean method called <code>checkDate()</code>\nThis will mess up your code. Here is how:</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>So first the <code>isTrueDate</code> you used inside your method, <code>checkDate()</code> is kept local to that method because you declared it inside there. If you did not do this, you likely would have gotten a separate error because you declared a boolean <code>isTrueDate</code> in two separate places. You declared it at the top in that first code snippet, and you declared it in that method. Normally, this would cause an error because you have already declared it once and changing the value would only require you to assign <code>isTrueDate</code> to something else with an equal sign rather than declaring it again. To really show you what I mean, look at this example:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Incorrect:</p>\n<pre><code>boolean isTrueDate = true;\n//Other actions\n//I want to change the value of isTrueDate\nboolean isTrueDate = false;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Correct:</p>\n<pre><code>boolean isTrueDate = true;\n//Other actions\n//I want to change the value of isTrueDate\nisTrueDate = false;\n</code></pre>\n<p>What you did (doesn't return error but messes up your code):\nI put it in a different order to better show the problem.</p>\n<pre><code>public static boolean checkDate(String ticketDate) {\n    boolean isTrueDate = true; //first declaration\n\n//Lots of conditions\n}\nstatic void someMethod() {\n\n//This method may not be exactly how you did it, \n//but you did not show me that.\n\n    boolean isTrueDate = true; //usually invalid second declaration. \n    //However, it still works b/c they are in different methods and\n    // thus kept separate from each other.

Im not here for &#39;not learning&#39; I do want to learn and understand where im failing, sometimes the answer gives me more insight than the questions by doing reverse."},{"owner":{"account_id":47283,"reputation":703817,"user_id":139985,"accept_rate":69,"display_name":"Stephen C"},"score":0,"creation_date":1646574393,"post_id":71370637,"comment_id":126152360,"body_markdown":"Do you understand what `this` is?
