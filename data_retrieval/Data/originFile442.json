This way, an item would be an `Order`.\r\n\r\nOption2: Another way to do that is by using the [driving query pattern](https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/docs/current/reference/html/common-patterns.html#drivingQueryBasedItemReaders). The idea is to make your reader return `Order`s, and use a processor to enrich orders with their details. This works for small/medium data sets, but performs poorly for large data sets (because of the additional query per item). This is related to the algorithm itself, not to Spring Batch per se.\r\n\r\nYou would prefer option 1 in which the database does the join in an efficient way and gives you back order items pre-filled with their details.\r\n\r\n***EDIT: Add sample for the driving query pattern***\r\n\r\nThe following sample shows the idea of the driving query pattern. The reader returns items of type `Person`. The processor enriches person items with their addresses. Look how the reader fetches only the id and name of the person, but not the address. You can adapt it to `Order` and `OrderDetails` in your case.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/*\r\n * Copyright 2022 the original author or authors.\r\n *\r\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;);\r\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n *\r\n *       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n *\r\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an &quot;AS IS&quot;

is not a good encapsulation of an item in the chunk-oriented processing model of Spring Batch.</p>\n<p>Option 1: You can change your query to join order and orderDetails and return items of type <code>Order</code>. This way, an item would be an <code>Order</code>.</p>\n<p>Option2: Another way to do that is by using the <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/docs/current/reference/html/common-patterns.html#drivingQueryBasedItemReaders\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">driving query pattern</a>. The idea is to make your reader return <code>Order</code>s, and use a processor to enrich orders with their details. This works for small/medium data sets, but performs poorly for large data sets (because of the additional query per item). This is related to the algorithm itself, not to Spring Batch per se.</p>\n<p>You would prefer option 1 in which the database does the join in an efficient way and gives you back order items pre-filled with their details.</p>\n<p><em><strong>EDIT: Add sample for the driving query pattern</strong></em></p>\n<p>The following sample shows the idea of the driving query pattern. The reader returns items of type <code>Person</code>. The processor enriches person items with their addresses. Look how the reader fetches only the id and name of the person, but not the address. You can adapt it to <code>Order</code> and <code>OrderDetails</code> in your case.</p>\n<pre><code>/*\n * Copyright 2022 the original author or authors.\n *\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;);\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an &quot;AS IS&quot;

and if the authentication is successful the application must redirect the user to the registration page which is has a url ```/accounts/register```. I am also using MySQL database and the spring-security dependency is also added to my ```pomo.xml```. The user registration is working fine therefore I didn&#39;t provided the controller which is regitering the user.\r\n\r\nAfter editind my home controller to submit the app is still not authenticating, instead it is returning the same login url with an error parameter ```http://localhost:8080/login?error```.","title":"How to implement user authentication in spring-boot 3.0.6 using spring MVC","body":"<p>I am currently working on a SpringBoot application for user registration and authentication.
