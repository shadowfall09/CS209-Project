Here is some information you can take advantage of:\r\n - Java uses Unicode for characters\r\n - In Unicode, the letters of the alphabet &#39;A&#39; to &#39;Z&#39; are consecutive.[1]\r\n - In Java, characters are an integer type.\r\n\r\nSo, in Java, characters can be treated as numbers. You can do arithmetic on them. The character &#39;A&#39; has a decimal value of 65. The character &#39;B&#39;  is 66, and so on. [2]\r\n\r\nSo, you can eliminate the bunch of `if` statements, and use one `for` loop by using this statement:\r\n\r\n     int column = columnInput - &#39;A&#39;;\r\n\r\nHowever, I changed `columnInput` from a `String` to a `char`.  The corresponding call gets changed to this:\r\n\r\n    putNumber(board, &#39;B&#39;));\r\n\r\nIn Java, a character between single quote marks represents a `char` literal. When between double quote marks, as in `&quot;B&quot;`, it&#39;s a character `String` literal.  \r\n\r\nIf you need to leave it a character `String`, use a line like this:\r\n    \r\n     int column = columnInput.charAt(0) - &#39;A&#39;;\r\n\r\nBack to the bugs:\r\n\r\nNext, your code isn&#39;t actually looking for the first zero.

Inside the `for` loop, you want to check if you have found a `0`.\r\n\r\nOnce you find a `0` and change it to a `1`, you want to exit the `for` loop.

A thread can be interrupted at _any_ time safely.\r\n\r\nTo quote from the [`Thread.interrupt()` javadocs][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt; * If this thread is blocked in an invocation of the wait(), wait(long), or wait(long, int) methods of the Object class, or of the join(), join(long), join(long, int), sleep(long), or sleep(long, int), methods of this class, then its interrupt status will be cleared and it will receive an InterruptedException.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; * If this thread is blocked in an I/O operation upon an interruptible channel then the channel will be closed, the thread&#39;s interrupt status will be set, and the thread will receive a java.nio.channels.ClosedByInterruptException.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; * If this thread is blocked in a java.nio.channels.Selector then the thread&#39;s interrupt status will be set and it will return immediately from the selection operation, possibly with a non-zero value, just as if the selector&#39;s wakeup method were invoked.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; * If none of the previous conditions hold then this thread&#39;s interrupt status will be set.\r\n\r\nIt is important to add that if the thread&#39;s interrupt bit has been set and _then_ `wait()` (and others) is called, then the `wait()` will throw `InterruptedException` immediately.\r\n\r\nSo you can&#39;t catch `InterruptedExeption` everywhere since only certain methods throw it.  If you want to see if a thread has been interrupted (again has the interrupt bit set) then the right thing to do is to test for it directly with the `Thread.getCurrentThread().isInterrupted()`.

By passing <code>JTextField</code> reference a <code>DocumentListener</code> is added which will do the work of checking what word is typed and whether to display suggestions or not and if so what suggestions to display. When a word is typed the <code>DocumentListener</code> will fire<code>wordTyped(String wordTyped)</code> method with the current word being typed or (at least how much ever of the word has been typed), in <code>wordTyped(..)</code> the word will be checked against those in the <code>AutoSuggestor</code>s classes  <em>dictionary</em> which is a basic <code>ArrayList</code> of <code>String</code> this can be set on the fly as seen in the below example:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JzN4H.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>(For now you will have to use mouse and click the word you want to be auto completed, or use <kbd>DOWN</kbd> to transverse suggestions and the <em>textfield</em> and <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to select suggestion when traversing using <em>down</em> key.

That&#39;s why we have stop signs and traffic lights. (Alternatively, there are things like traffic circles, but even those have some overhead - you really can&#39;t just go through them at full speed as if they weren&#39;t there).\r\n\r\nThere are lots of ways of doing asynchronous and parallel operations other than using that type of synchronization:\r\n\r\n  - Non-blocking I/O. The argument here is that, when you&#39;re interacting with a server or slow I/O device or something, most of the time is spent waiting for a response from the device or server, so you really don&#39;t need multiple threads to handle that - you just need to allow the original thread to do other work while it&#39;s waiting for a response. My usual analogy here is: suppose you go out to eat with a group of 10 people. When the waiter comes to take orders, the first person he asks to order isn&#39;t ready yet.

That's why we have stop signs and traffic lights. (Alternatively, there are things like traffic circles, but even those have some overhead - you really can't just go through them at full speed as if they weren't there).</p>\n\n<p>There are lots of ways of doing asynchronous and parallel operations other than using that type of synchronization:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Non-blocking I/O. The argument here is that, when you're interacting with a server or slow I/O device or something, most of the time is spent waiting for a response from the device or server, so you really don't need multiple threads to handle that - you just need to allow the original thread to do other work while it's waiting for a response. My usual analogy here is: suppose you go out to eat with a group of 10 people. When the waiter comes to take orders, the first person he asks to order isn't ready yet. The sensible thing to do, of course, is for the waiter to take other people's orders first, and then to come back to the first guy.

It's generally a better path to start from local using SAM or Serverless, however with some effort you might also be able to retrofit your Lambda functions into that local tooling.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":6194051,"reputation":51,"user_id":4825933,"accept_rate":86,"display_name":"F&#233;lix Mensah"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":623,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":74719374,"answer_count":1,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1670428128,"creation_date":1669997859,"question_id":74658665,"body_markdown":"Our development team has created several AWS Lambdas Functions written in Java that are currently running on the cloud.\r\n\r\nI have imported them locally on my computers.\r\n\r\nThey are all Maven projects.\r\n\r\nI have already installed both the JDK and Maven.\r\n\r\nI do not know what is the next step for launching them locally.\r\n\r\nIs there any client that I should install before?","title":"How to launch an AWS Lambda Function locally on my computer?","body":"<p>Our development team has created several AWS Lambdas Functions written in Java that are currently running on the cloud.</p>\n<p>I have imported them locally on my computers.</p>\n<p>They are all Maven projects.</p>\n<p>I have already installed both the JDK and Maven.</p>\n<p>I do not know what is the next step for launching them locally.</p>\n<p>Is there any client that I should install before?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","eclipse","git","github","jgit"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4243,"reputation":1301938,"user_id":6309,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"VonC"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1379167330,"creation_date":1379152123,"answer_id":18800464,"question_id":18800062,"body_markdown":"The Eclipse git plugin isn&#39;t responsible for the build.\r\n\r\nBut you can customize your Java builder and add a pre-build event which will modify one of your java files with the right version string in it.\r\n\r\n- See &quot;[Pre-Build events in Eclipse][1]&quot; for adding that pre-build step,\r\n- and use a task like &quot;[jgit-buildnumber][2]&quot;:  a Git &quot;build number&quot; plugin for Maven and Ant based on JGit.
