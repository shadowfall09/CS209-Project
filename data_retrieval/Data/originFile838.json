If the result of a calculation is too large, the result &quot;wraps around&quot;. Sometimes, it  is desirable to detect an overflow. To support that, the Java [`Math` API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html#multiplyExact(int,int)) has a number of  `~Exact` methods. These throw an `ArithmeticException` when an overflow occurs. \r\n\r\n\r\nSo, the idea here is to calculate integer factorials, beginning at one, and incrementing until an overflow is caught, using `try ... catch`.\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that this could be done without using `try ... catch` by testing for a result in which the result of the multiplication is less than the previous result. Since the sequence of results is strictly increasing, finding a smaller value in the result sequence would indicate a wraparound occurred. However,  this isn&#39;t reliable: A calculation could wraparound and still produce an incorrect result greater than the previous result. \r\n\r\nThe largest factorial that can be computed in Java using `long` is \r\n20! = 2432902008176640000.  That&#39;s 20! = 2,432,902,008,176,640,000. One can test that by changing all `int` to `long` in the above code. \r\n\r\nComment: Although Java doesn&#39;t allow `unsigned` integer types to be declared, unsigned integer calculations are possible. Support for unsigned calculations includes calculations in which the result wraps around, and unsigned methods, such as `toUnsignedString`. However, that seems to be irrelevant to this discussion, since the calculation of 13! would overflow an `unsigned int` and the calculation of 21! would overflow an `unsigned long`. \r\n\r\nComment: The O/P used recursion to calculate factorials. I used iteration. While I am a fan of recursion, I prefer to use iteration when an iterative solution  is easy to find and implement. Recursion can use more overhead than iteration.\r\n\r\nComment: Optimizing compilers will sometimes change code using recursion to using iteration.

These throw an <code>ArithmeticException</code> when an overflow occurs.</p>\n<p>So, the idea here is to calculate integer factorials, beginning at one, and incrementing until an overflow is caught, using <code>try ... catch</code>.</p>\n<p>It is conceivable that this could be done without using <code>try ... catch</code> by testing for a result in which the result of the multiplication is less than the previous result. Since the sequence of results is strictly increasing, finding a smaller value in the result sequence would indicate a wraparound occurred. However,  this isn't reliable: A calculation could wraparound and still produce an incorrect result greater than the previous result.</p>\n<p>The largest factorial that can be computed in Java using <code>long</code> is\n20! = 2432902008176640000.  That's 20! = 2,432,902,008,176,640,000. One can test that by changing all <code>int</code> to <code>long</code> in the above code.</p>\n<p>Comment: Although Java doesn't allow <code>unsigned</code> integer types to be declared, unsigned integer calculations are possible. Support for unsigned calculations includes calculations in which the result wraps around, and unsigned methods, such as <code>toUnsignedString</code>. However, that seems to be irrelevant to this discussion, since the calculation of 13! would overflow an <code>unsigned int</code> and the calculation of 21! would overflow an <code>unsigned long</code>.</p>\n<p>Comment: The O/P used recursion to calculate factorials. I used iteration. While I am a fan of recursion, I prefer to use iteration when an iterative solution  is easy to find and implement. Recursion can use more overhead than iteration.</p>\n<p>Comment: Optimizing compilers will sometimes change code using recursion to using iteration. That may have been the case in the O/P's code.</p>\n<p>Output, using <code>long</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>0! = 1\n1! = 1\n2! = 2\n3! = 6\n4! = 24\n5! = 120\n6! = 720\n7! = 5040\n8! = 40320\n9! = 362880\n10! = 3628800\n11! = 39916800\n12! = 479001600\n13! = 6227020800\n14! = 87178291200\n15! = 1307674368000\n16! = 20922789888000\n17! = 355687428096000\n18! = 6402373705728000\n19! = 121645100408832000\n20! = 2432902008176640000\n21! = -2\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":22824810,"reputation":9,"user_id":16974223,"display_name":"Big Moustache guy"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":527,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1670079041,"creation_date":1669860743,"question_id":74636232,"body_markdown":"What is the greatest factorial we can calculate using an int in Java 19?\r\n\r\nI have found the calculation is correct up to *Factorial(12)* using an int to stock the result.\r\n\r\nHere is the recursive code I use:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static int Factorial(int n) {\r\n    if (n &gt;= 13) {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Trop grand&quot;);\r\n        return -1;\r\n    }\r\n    if (n == 0) {\r\n        return 1;\r\n    } else {\r\n        return n * Factorial(n - 1);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you find the same result?\r\n\r\nSubsidiary question: how would you implement the function with a long variable?\r\n\r\nI tried everything, expected nothing and nothing special happened.

In OOP it's similar, abstraction is a concept where you show only relevant data and conceal unnecessary details of an object from the user.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":25179364,"reputation":29,"user_id":19021050,"display_name":"MBen"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1670075241,"creation_date":1670075241,"answer_id":74667327,"question_id":64520515,"body_markdown":"[Purifying] is not means [Abstraction], Purifying is the important rule of Inheritance Pillar&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n[Hiding] is not means [Abstraction], Hiding is the important rule of Encapsulation Pillar &lt;br&gt;\r\n--------&lt;br&gt;\r\n—&gt; Hiding or Purifying or Covering or Encapsulating Never = Abstraction &lt;—\r\n-----\r\nThe First Definition is the Correct Answer:\r\nAbstraction is the progress of modeling real-world objects in the programming language.&lt;br&gt;\r\n—&lt;&lt; Abstraction = Classes = Blueprints = Modelling some Objects&gt;&gt; —&lt;br&gt;\r\nAbstraction is the first Step Rule &amp; Pillar of OOP Pillars…&lt;br&gt;\r\n--------&lt;br&gt;\r\nwich means [Classes and Interfaces] …&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n[Abstraction] is not more than a [Modelling] …&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n**in general:**\r\n\r\n    A home Construction Engineer cannot start Constructing any home without a Blueprint !!\r\n\r\nAbstraction =&gt;&gt; ( `it’s the first Step into OOP` ) and ( `the Pillar of All Pillars` )\r\n\r\nwithout Abstraction there is no Classes no Interfaces no Abstract Classes and Automatically no Objects..&lt;br&gt;\r\n----------&lt;br&gt; \r\n=&gt; (no Classes[Abstraction] no Objects[REAL THINGS] !!)","title":"What is the correct definition of &#39;abstract&#39; in OOP?","body":"<p>[Purifying] is not means [Abstraction], Purifying is the important rule of Inheritance Pillar<br></p>\n<h2>[Hiding] is not means [Abstraction], Hiding is the important rule of Encapsulation Pillar <br>\n--------<br>\n—&gt; Hiding or Purifying or Covering or Encapsulating Never = Abstraction &lt;—</h2>\n<p>The First Definition is the Correct Answer:\nAbstraction is the progress of modeling real-world objects in the programming language.<br>\n—&lt;&lt; Abstraction = Classes = Blueprints = Modelling some Objects&gt;&gt; —<br>\nAbstraction is the first Step Rule &amp; Pillar of OOP Pillars…<br>\n--------<br>\nwich means [Classes and Interfaces] …<br></p>\n<p>[Abstraction] is not more than a [Modelling] …<br></p>\n<p><strong>in general:</strong></p>\n<pre><code>A home Construction Engineer cannot start Constructing any home without a Blueprint !!\n</code></pre>\n<p>Abstraction =&gt;&gt; ( <code>it’s the first Step into OOP</code> ) and ( <code>the Pillar of All Pillars</code> )</p>\n<p>without Abstraction there is no Classes no Interfaces no Abstract Classes and Automatically no Objects..<br>\n----------<br>\n=&gt; (no Classes[Abstraction] no Objects[REAL THINGS] !!)</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":19817696,"reputation":49,"user_id":14514967,"display_name":"namnv"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":622,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":64520570,"answer_count":4,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1670075241,"creation_date":1603602042,"question_id":64520515,"body_markdown":"I am trying to understand the definition of &#39;abstraction&#39; in OOP.\r\n\r\nI have come across a few main definitions.\r\nAre they all valid?\r\nIs one of them wrong?\r\nI&#39;m confused.\r\n\r\n**Definition 1**:  \r\n**Abstraction is the progress of modeling real-world objects into programming language**  \r\nAbstraction is not about interfaces or abstract classes.  \r\nAbstraction is the progress of modeling real-world objects in the programming language.   \r\nHence interfaces and abstract classes are just two techniques used in this progress.   \r\nIn an Object-Oriented Programming language like Java, everything is an abstraction: *interface, class, field, method, variable, etc.*  \r\n\r\nAbstraction is the fundamental concept on which other concepts rely: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism\r\n\r\n**Definition 2**:\r\nAbstraction is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages.

Mark it as <code>@Repository</code> and just autowire it to your service classes (or use constructor injection and just use like a variable)\nLike:</p>\n<pre><code>@Service\npublic class PlayerRepositoryDB {\n\nprivate IPlayerRepository playerRepository;\n\npublic PlayerRepositoryDB (IPlayerRepository playerRepository){ //CONSTRUCTOR\nthis.playerRepository = playerRepository;...\n</code></pre>\n<p>3- DB repository classes are implementing <code>IPlayerRepository</code> but it must be marked as <code>@Repository</code> and It should extend either <code>CrudRepository</code> or <code>JpaRepository</code> (which extends CrudRepository already).</p>\n<p>Like:</p>\n<pre><code>    @Repository\n    public interface IPlayerRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Player, Long&gt; {\n//Here are the methods;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, the <code>Long</code> is the type of primary key of <code>Player</code> class.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":529143,"reputation":136619,"user_id":1766831,"display_name":"Rick James"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1669658261,"creation_date":1669658261,"answer_id":74604685,"question_id":74535293,"body_markdown":"Hibernate XML:\r\n\r\n       &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.connection.CharSet&quot;&gt;utf8mb4&lt;/property&gt;\r\n       &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.connection.characterEncoding&quot;&gt;UTF-8&lt;/property&gt;\r\n       &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.connection.useUnicode&quot;&gt;true&lt;/property&gt;\r\n\r\nConnection url:\r\n\r\n    db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db_name?useUnicode=true&amp;character_set_server=utf8mb4\r\n\r\nAs a side note I would like to make one clarification that UTF-8 is the character encoding while utf8mb4 is a character set that MySQL supports.

And for any collection, you would usually only know what you are removing if you iterate through the collection.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3887004,"reputation":46525,"user_id":3218114,"accept_rate":84,"display_name":"Braj"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1399831438,"creation_date":1399831005,"answer_id":23596028,"question_id":23595749,"body_markdown":"Simply try using `HashSet#toArray()` method\r\n\r\n    HashSet&lt;Integer&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;Integer&gt;();\r\n    set.add(1);\r\n\r\n    if (set.size() == 1) { // make sure that there is only one element in set\r\n        Integer value = set.toArray(new Integer[1])[0];\r\n        System.out.println(value);//output 1\r\n    }","title":"If only one element in a hashset, how can I get it out?","body":"<p>Simply try using <code>HashSet#toArray()</code> method</p>\n\n<pre><code>HashSet&lt;Integer&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;Integer&gt;();\nset.add(1);\n\nif (set.size() == 1) { // make sure that there is only one element in set\n    Integer value = set.toArray(new Integer[1])[0];\n    System.out.println(value);//output 1\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1744260,"reputation":14886,"user_id":1594823,"accept_rate":64,"display_name":"Saikat"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1670049950,"creation_date":1670049950,"answer_id":74664561,"question_id":23595749,"body_markdown":"Solution Using Java Stream\r\n==========================\r\n\r\nIf you want to use [Java Stream][1] any of the following options will give you the desired result:\r\n\r\nOption 1\r\n--------\r\nJust return the only element from the stream:\r\n\r\n`set.stream().findFirst().get()`\r\n\r\nOption 2\r\n--------\r\nOr use `Stream.reduce`; since adding the only element to zero has no effect \r\n\r\n(*a little too much IMHO :)*)\r\n\r\n`set.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum)`\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can test it [here][2].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html\r\n  [2]: https://www.jdoodle.com/iembed/v0/AxG","title":"If only one element in a hashset, how can I get it out?","body":"<h1>Solution Using Java Stream</h1>\n<p>If you want to use <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Java Stream</a> any of the following options will give you the desired result:</p>\n<h2>Option 1</h2>\n<p>Just return the only element from the stream:</p>\n<p><code>set.stream().findFirst().get()</code></p>\n<h2>Option 2</h2>\n<p>Or use <code>Stream.reduce</code>; since adding the only element to zero has no effect</p>\n<p>(<em>a little too much IMHO :)</em>)</p>\n<p><code>set.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum)</code></p>\n<p>You can test it <a href=\"https://www.jdoodle.com/iembed/v0/AxG\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":3443561,"reputation":245,"user_id":2884871,"accept_rate":83,"display_name":"cow12331"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":11836,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":8,"accepted_answer_id":23596028,"answer_count":5,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1670050488,"creation_date":1399829359,"question_id":23595749,"body_markdown":"I have a `set` like below:\r\n\r\n    HashSet&lt;Integer&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;Integer&gt;();\r\n    set.add(1);\r\n\r\nHow can I get the `1` out?
