This allows you to use the `compareTo` method for comparing items in the tree.\r\n\r\nIn the `GBinTree` class, the add method uses `item.compareTo(bn.item)` instead of the `&lt;` operator for comparison. This ensures that the comparison is done using the compareTo method of the generic type `T`.\r\n\r\nThe `toString` method in the `GBinTree` class now checks for `root == null` before performing traversal.

Try it - go write a class, stick `implements Serializable` on it, _do not_ add that `serialVersionUID`, and compile it with vanilla javac. You will find that [A] that compiles fine, and [B] no warnings are generated either.\r\n\r\nVarious linter tools (tools that add additional code cleanliness checks) incorrectly whine about having to add that field. There are times when that field is required, but on net you usually should not add it.\r\n\r\n## What is that field even for?\r\n\r\nThe only time the field even comes up, is if you are attempting to serialize with version A of a class, and then deserialize it back when version B is on the classpath. (B being not the same as A, and in fact, so different that there are different signatures in them).\r\n\r\n__This is extremely tricky__ - what _does_ it mean when the Person class which used to have `String name` now has a `PersonName name` instead, because name is now split into initials, partner name, nickname, and so on? You can&#39;t just add some `serialVersionUID` and pray the java serialization mechanism just knows what to do.\r\n\r\nBecause of that, the serialization mechanism by default will flat out refuse to deserialize into a class that has been changed (it changed a signature: a field or method was added/removed, or an existing method/field was renamed, or a field&#39;s erased type has been changed, or a method gained/lost parameters, or one of its parameters&#39; erased type has been changed).\r\n\r\n__This is correct__ - almost always you can&#39;t &#39;just&#39; deserialize into a changed version like that and almost always you need manual attention (use the `readObject` and such mechanisms to take control of the serialization mechanism).\r\n\r\nSetting `serialVersionUID` is the mechanism to indicate to the java deserialization mechanism: Actually, just deserialize into this new version; leave any newly introduced field as `null / 0 / &#39;\\0&#39; / false` - and ignore any values for old fields that no longer exist in the new version.\r\n\r\n## There is no need for the field\r\n\r\nAll classes have a serialVersionUID, whether you have that field or not. Classes with an explicit sVU field have that as sVU, other classes have their calculated sVU. You can trivially see these with the `serialver` tool that is sitting right next to your `java` and `javac` executables.\r\n\r\n## The proper way to do it\r\n\r\n__If__ (highly unlikely!) you need to serialize/deserialize between 2 different versions, __and__ (even more unlikely!) you can &#39;get away&#39; with having the deserializer simply try its best, then __write some test code that confirms this__ (after all, your app would be broken if that fails), which means you must still have the old version of the class.

Try it - go write a class, stick <code>implements Serializable</code> on it, <em>do not</em> add that <code>serialVersionUID</code>, and compile it with vanilla javac. You will find that [A] that compiles fine, and [B] no warnings are generated either.</p>\n<p>Various linter tools (tools that add additional code cleanliness checks) incorrectly whine about having to add that field. There are times when that field is required, but on net you usually should not add it.</p>\n<h2>What is that field even for?</h2>\n<p>The only time the field even comes up, is if you are attempting to serialize with version A of a class, and then deserialize it back when version B is on the classpath. (B being not the same as A, and in fact, so different that there are different signatures in them).</p>\n<p><strong>This is extremely tricky</strong> - what <em>does</em> it mean when the Person class which used to have <code>String name</code> now has a <code>PersonName name</code> instead, because name is now split into initials, partner name, nickname, and so on? You can't just add some <code>serialVersionUID</code> and pray the java serialization mechanism just knows what to do.</p>\n<p>Because of that, the serialization mechanism by default will flat out refuse to deserialize into a class that has been changed (it changed a signature: a field or method was added/removed, or an existing method/field was renamed, or a field's erased type has been changed, or a method gained/lost parameters, or one of its parameters' erased type has been changed).</p>\n<p><strong>This is correct</strong> - almost always you can't 'just' deserialize into a changed version like that and almost always you need manual attention (use the <code>readObject</code> and such mechanisms to take control of the serialization mechanism).</p>\n<p>Setting <code>serialVersionUID</code> is the mechanism to indicate to the java deserialization mechanism: Actually, just deserialize into this new version; leave any newly introduced field as <code>null / 0 / '\\0' / false</code> - and ignore any values for old fields that no longer exist in the new version.</p>\n<h2>There is no need for the field</h2>\n<p>All classes have a serialVersionUID, whether you have that field or not. Classes with an explicit sVU field have that as sVU, other classes have their calculated sVU. You can trivially see these with the <code>serialver</code> tool that is sitting right next to your <code>java</code> and <code>javac</code> executables.</p>\n<h2>The proper way to do it</h2>\n<p><strong>If</strong> (highly unlikely!) you need to serialize/deserialize between 2 different versions, <strong>and</strong> (even more unlikely!) you can 'get away' with having the deserializer simply try its best, then <strong>write some test code that confirms this</strong> (after all, your app would be broken if that fails), which means you must still have the old version of the class. So, just <code>serialver</code> it, and stick that serial version into your new version.</p>\n<p><strong>That is the one and only circumstance a class should EVER have a <code>serialVersionUID</code> field</strong>.</p>\n<h2>More problems on the horizon</h2>\n<p>Java's baked in serialization mechanism is not particularly nice.

That is, we allocate a fixed block of memory and reference it as though it&#39;s a tree. We can do that because the binary heap is a very special type of tree. In concept this is not much different than how we implement a two-dimensional array.\r\n\r\nConsider a two-dimensional array declared as `a[3,4]`. Most languages allocate that as a single block of memory--a linear array--of size 12. But we address it as though it&#39;s a two-dimensional structure. The compiler converts our 2D addressing to one-dimensional array indices (assuming row-major ordering), like this:\r\n\r\n     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\r\n    | Row 1 | Row 2 |  Row 3\r\n\r\nIn our two-dimensional view it looks like this:\r\n\r\n     1  2  3  4\r\n     5  6  7  8\r\n     9 10 11 12\r\n\r\nSo `a[2,3]` resolves to index 7.\r\n\r\nWhat does that have to to with heaps?\r\n-\r\n\r\nBecause a binary heap is a complete binary tree in which all levels except possibly the last are full, and the last is left-filled (i.e. all empty space is on the right side of the last level), we can overlay a tree structure on the array in much the same way we overlay the two-dimensional array.\r\n\r\nWe know that the first element of the array is the root of the heap. We know that the next two array elements are children of the root. The next four elements are those children&#39;s children, and so on. So in a binary heap with 15 nodes we have:\r\n\r\n - Index 1 - root node\r\n - Indices 2 and 3 - Children of root node\r\n - Indices 4,5,6,7 - Children of root&#39;s children\r\n   (4 and 5 are children of the node at index 2. 6 and 7 are children of the node at index 3).\r\n - Indices 8 through 15 - Children of nodes at indices 4-7.\r\n\r\nThat leads to a view of the array that looks like this:\r\n\r\n    1\r\n    2 3\r\n    4 5 6 7\r\n    8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\r\n\r\nOr, viewed as a tree:\r\n\r\n                1\r\n          2           3\r\n       4     5     6     7\r\n      8 9  10 11 12 13 14 15\r\n\r\nThe binary heap is still a tree. We&#39;re just using our knowledge of the special nature of a binary heap to implement it more efficiently than we can implement other types of trees.\r\n\r\nYes, we are using a linear data structure to implement a non-linear data structure. But that&#39;s true of *all* the data structures we use. Early processors (think 8086 and before) viewed memory as essentially one big array. Software would essentially split that up into different areas for operating system, program code, processor stack, process heap, etc. And within the process heap (again, one big linear data structure), programs would allocate and deallocate individual blocks to build non-linear data structures. Even today&#39;s systems, with memory virtualization and address translation, things work much the same way: your program allocates large blocks of linear memory and manages them, parceling out small pieces for non-linear data structures.\r\n\r\nAnd then there&#39;s the linked list: a linear data structure that&#39;s implemented in terms of a non-linear data structure. Again, the *model* is a list--a linear data structure. The *implementation* is not linear at all.\r\n\r\nAnd then consider implementing a linked list in an array. Each element of the array contains the node data and an index to the next item in the list. Traversed in order, the list nodes might be at array indices 1,7,5,4,6,2,3. Whether that&#39;s a linear or non-linear data structure depends on how you&#39;re looking at the problem. Or perhaps which part of the implementation you&#39;re looking at. Again, the model of the list is linear. And the implementation is in a linear data structure (the array). But the first node in the list is at the beginning of the array, the second node is at the end, and the nodes in the middle are in essentially random order.

However, when I change the <code>TextArea</code> <code>analysis</code> with</p>\n<pre><code>gridPane.add(analysis,2,1,4,1);\nanalysis.setPrefRowCount(4);\n</code></pre>\n<p>the <code>TextArea</code> <code>paliVerse</code> also spans over rows, even though the <code>PrefRowCount</code> is 2:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fx1hG.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fx1hG.png\" alt=\"current\" /></a></p>\n<p>How can I change this so that it looks like:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uPi1r.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uPi1r.png\" alt=\"desired\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is the relevant code:</p>\n<pre><code>package com.example.projektver180523;\n\nimport java.sql.*;\n\nimport javafx.application.Application;\nimport javafx.geometry.Insets;\nimport javafx.scene.Scene;\nimport javafx.scene.control.*;\nimport javafx.scene.layout.*;\nimport javafx.stage.Stage;\n\npublic class HelloApplication extends Application {\n    private ComboBox&lt;Integer&gt; comboBox;\n    private TextArea paliVerse;\n    private TextArea paliVerseGER;\n    private TextArea analysis;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        launch(args);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void start(Stage stage) throws SQLException {\n\n        // Erstelle die ComboBox\n        comboBox = new ComboBox&lt;&gt;();\n\n        // Fülle die ComboBox automatisch\n        fillComboBox();\n\n        // Erstelle die TextAreas\n        paliVerse = new TextArea();\n        paliVerseGER = new TextArea();\n        analysis = new TextArea();\n\n        // Textfeld ist unveränderlich\n        paliVerse.setEditable(false);\n        paliVerseGER.setEditable(false);\n        analysis.setEditable(false);\n\n        // 2 columns preferred\n        paliVerse.setPrefColumnCount(2);\n        paliVerseGER.setPrefColumnCount(2);\n\n//        // 2 rows preferred for paliVerse and German translation textArea\n        paliVerse.setPrefRowCount(2);\n        paliVerseGER.setPrefRowCount(2);\n        analysis.setPrefRowCount(4);\n\n        GridPane.setConstraints(comboBox, 0, 1);\n        GridPane gridPane = new GridPane();\n\n        // Abstand nach innen setzen\n        gridPane.setPadding(new Insets(10));\n\n        // horizontaler Abstand zwischen Kindern\n        gridPane.setHgap(10);\n\n        // vertikaler Abstand zwischen Kindern\n        gridPane.setVgap(10);\n\n        // Spalte 0 ist 150 weit\n        gridPane.getColumnConstraints().add(new ColumnConstraints(230));\n\n        // Spalte 0 ist 480 weit\n        gridPane.getColumnConstraints().add(new ColumnConstraints(600));\n\n        gridPane.add(new Label(&quot;Vers Nummer:&quot;), 0, 0);\n        gridPane.add(comboBox, 1, 0);\n        gridPane.add(new Label(&quot;Palitext:&quot;), 0, 1);\n        gridPane.add(paliVerse, 1, 1);\n        gridPane.add(new Label(&quot;Übersetzung Deutsch:&quot;), 0, 2);\n        gridPane.add(paliVerseGER, 1, 2);\n        gridPane.add(new Label(&quot;Analyse:&quot;), 2, 0);\n        gridPane.add(analysis, 2, 1, 4, 1);\n        Scene scene = new Scene(gridPane, 1200, 400);\n\n        // Verknüpfe CSS-Datei\n        scene.getStylesheets().add(&quot;styles.css&quot;);\n\n        // Zeige das Hauptfenster an\n        stage.setTitle(&quot;Dhammapada Reader&quot;);\n        stage.setScene(scene);\n        stage.show();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","mongodb","spring-boot"],"owner":{"account_id":14248830,"reputation":1,"user_id":10292986,"display_name":"aasu dhillon"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1685117313,"creation_date":1685110419,"question_id":76341666,"body_markdown":"Scenario: From “psorder” collection fetching ‘worNumber’ list along with conditions (Sub Query) and pass that list, with in the same collection and exclude those ‘worNumber’.\r\n\r\nQuery: \r\n\r\n```\r\ndb.getCollection(‘psorder’).find({\r\n    “personName”:{$exists:false},\r\n    “worNumber”:{\r\n    $nin: db.getCollection(‘psorder’).distinct(“worNumber”,{“statusId”:“new”,\r\n    “personName”:{$exists:true},\r\n    “personName”: { $ne: “robert” }})\r\n    }\r\n    }).limit(1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow to achieve this in aggregation and Java code.
