One of the many benefits of Spring is the ability to extend the current APIs to customize or alter the behavior, for example, caching.\r\n\r\nIn [Spring&#39;s Cache Abstraction][4], the 2 primary interfaces of the SPI are the [`Cache`][5] and [`CacheManager`][6] interfaces in the `org.springframework.cache` package ([Javadoc][7]).\r\n\r\nBy way of example, and to present 1 possible solution to this problem (off the top of my head) let&#39;s assume you are using Redis for caching. As you no doubt already know, without Spring Boot, your application configuration to enable caching would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Conifguration\r\n@EnableCaching\r\nclass CachingConfiguration {\r\n\r\n  @Bean\r\n  RedisCacheManager cacheManager() {\r\n    // ...\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, you would need to 1) `EnableCaching` and 2) declare a `CacheManager` bean (named &quot;cacheManager&quot;) for the caching provider you want to use. Again, in this example we are using Redis.\r\n\r\nNow, we are going to introduce a 2nd configuration:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Configuration\r\n@Profile(&quot;read-only-microservice&quot;)\r\nclass ReadOnlyCachingConfiguration {\r\n\r\n  @Bean\r\n  BeanPostProcessor readOnlyCachingBeanPostProcessor() {\r\n\r\n    return new BeanPostProcessor() {\r\n\r\n      @Override\r\n      public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) {\r\n\r\n        return bean instanceof CacheManager\r\n          ? new ReadOnlyCacheManager((CacheManager) bean)\r\n          : bean;\r\n      } \r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt; NOTE: If your application is using multiple caching providers (e.g. Redis and Hazelcast), then the `instanceof` check may need to be altered here depending on your requirements.\r\n\r\nNotice 2 things here.\r\n\r\nFirst, notice the use of the Spring `@Profile` annotation. If your microservice is essentially the same application codebase deployed twice with slight configuration differences, then the first microservice can be configured to write to the cache when this profile is disabled (or rather not enabled). However, in the second deployment, you can enable this profile (e.g. as a JVM System property `-Dspring.profiles.active=read-only-microservice`) to disable the microservice from being able to write to the cache.\r\n\r\nBut, how do you prevent the second deployment of the microservice from writing to the cache?\r\n\r\nWell, the second thing to notice here is the &quot;wrapping&quot; (decorating) of the `CacheManager` bean (for example, the `RedisCacheManager`), with the `ReadOnlyCacheManager`.\r\n\r\nThe `ReadOnlyCacheManager` still implements the `CacheManager` interface, but it essentially wraps and decorates an existing `CacheManager`, such as the `RedisCacheManager`.\r\n\r\nThe sole purpose of the `CacheManager` is to find/lookup and serve `Cache` objects by &quot;name&quot; when caching operations, such as `@Cacheable` annotated application service methods are called.\r\n\r\nSo, our implementation would be:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass ReadOnlyCacheManager {\r\n\r\n\r\n  private final CacheManager source;\r\n\r\n  ReadOnlyCacheManager(@NonNull CacheManager cacheManager) {\r\n    Assert.notNull(cacheManager, &quot;CacheManager is required&quot;);\r\n    this.source = cacheManager;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public Cache getCache(String name) {\r\n\r\n    Cache cache = this.source.getCache(name);\r\n\r\n    return cache != null\r\n      ? new ReadOnlyCache(cache);\r\n      : null;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public Collection&lt;String&gt; getCacheNames() {\r\n    return this.source.getCacheNames();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPretty straight forward.\r\n\r\nNow, you only need to implement the `ReadOnlyCache` implementation that 1) implements the Spring `Cache` interface, 2) wraps the existing `Cache` implementation (e.g. `RedisCache`) and then 3) delegates to the source `Cache` object for the cache operations, except for the write operations (e.g. `put(key, value)`).\r\n\r\nFor example (partial implementation):\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass ReadOnlyCache {\r\n\r\n  private final Cache source;\r\n\r\n  ReadOnlyCache(@NonNull Cache cache) {\r\n    Assert.notNull(cache, &quot;Cache is required&quot;);\r\n    this.source = cache;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public &lt;T&gt; T get(Object key, Class&lt;T&gt; type) {\r\n    return this.source.get(key, type);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void put(Object key, Object value) {\r\n    // Do Nothing; the Cache is read-only!\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou would override each cache operation appropriately.\r\n\r\nYou could possible solve this problem other ways as well, such as by injecting your own AOP Aspect into the caching infrastructure. However, you must be careful to order the Aspects correctly.\r\n\r\nI prefer the approach I demonstrated above because 1) AOP is a form of &quot;decoration&quot; (or the [Decorator pattern][8]) and 2) this approach is very reliable and will even work with Spring Boot&#39;s auto-configuration of caching. With Spring Boot, you do not need to explicitly declare a `CacheManager` bean when you have a caching provider, such as Redis, or 1 of the other [supported caching providers][9] on the classpath and you have enabled caching (i.e. `@EnableCaching`).\r\n\r\nIf your microservice applications are different (e.g. 2 separate codebases) then you might not need the Profile I demonstrated above.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope this gives you more ideas on how you can customize the framework to your needs.\r\n\r\nI did not explicitly write a test or create an example this time (in my [repository][10], and specifically [here][11]) since I felt this was pretty straight forward. However, I have demonstrated this approach before in other cases. You might find this repository insightful, especially [here][12]. The `AbstractCacheDelegate` and `AbstractCacheManagerDelegate` help in the process of implementing Spring&#39;s `Cache` and `CacheManager` interfaces.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/integration.html#cache-annotations\r\n  [2]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/integration.html#cache-jsr-107\r\n  [3]: https://javadoc.io/static/javax.cache/cache-api/1.1.1/javax/cache/annotation/package-summary.html\r\n  [4]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/integration.html#cache\r\n  [5]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/Cache.html\r\n  [6]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/CacheManager.html\r\n  [7]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/package-summary.html\r\n  [8]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern\r\n  [9]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/io.html#io.caching.provider\r\n  [10]: https://github.com/jxblum/stackoverflow-questions-answers\r\n  [11]: https://github.com/jxblum/stackoverflow-questions-answers/tree/master/spring-cache\r\n  [12]: https://github.com/jxblum/stackoverflow-questions-answers/tree/master/spring-cache/src/main/java/io/stackoverflow/questions/answers/spring/cache","title":"Spring @Cacheable - is it possible to make reads from the cache without making writes to it?","body":"<p>By default, NO.</p>\n<p>There is/are no <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/integration.html#cache-annotations\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">annotation(s) in Spring</a>, or even JCache's API (more generally speaking, <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/integration.html#cache-jsr-107\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, or specifically <a href=\"https://javadoc.io/static/javax.cache/cache-api/1.1.1/javax/cache/annotation/package-summary.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) that enables read-only caching behavior.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, not all is lost in this case.

Everything appears to conform to the docs (though I&#39;m suspicious of my immutable builder&#39;d Goal class), and I&#39;ve attempted to follow advice given in the following places:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/47323883/why-room-entities-dont-work-with-immutable-properties-in-android\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/45541666/espresso-test-failing-no-interface-method-trackusage-in-usagetracker-java\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/44417136/room-persistence-library-run-time-exception-when-calling-rooms-inmemorybuilder-m\r\n\r\nBut I&#39;m not using Kotlin nor the `@Relation` annotation, and even when I played with all kinds of different versions in my build.gradle files, it stayed broken. The bright side is, I&#39;ve learned a lot about that boring part. tl;dr I&#39;m stumped.\r\n\r\nJust in case it&#39;s helpful context, my app is strongly based on the todo‑mvvm‑databinding example from https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture. I mention this because everything works in the sample, but I&#39;ve added some complexity and perhaps made a mistake along the way that somebody more experienced will recognize. Particularly, I&#39;ve mangled that `@Entity` Goal class (Task in the example app), trying to keep it immutable and adding the builder pattern and several attributes. I&#39;m not done mangling it either -- touched is about to be its own table.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m also unskilled in troubleshooting whatever turns an interface and a bunch of annotations into code. Any advice about where to look in resolving this is as useful as the answer it&#39;ll lead to. I&#39;m new to Android Studio, Java, and the whole build process.\r\n\r\nThank you!","title":"Android Room: &#39;NoSuchMethodError: No interface method&#39; for Dao methods that update, with Room.inMemoryDatabaseBuilder","body":"<p>I'm using Room on Android.

Confound me! What madness causes the computer to lie? GoalsDao.java excerpt:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/**\n * Update a goal.\n *\n * @param goal goal to be updated\n * @return the number of goals updated. This should always be 1.\n */\n@Update\nint updateGoal(Goal goal);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've exhausted all the low-hanging fruit on this one. Everything appears to conform to the docs (though I'm suspicious of my immutable builder'd Goal class), and I've attempted to follow advice given in the following places:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47323883/why-room-entities-dont-work-with-immutable-properties-in-android\">Why Room entities don&#39;t work with immutable properties in Android</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45541666/espresso-test-failing-no-interface-method-trackusage-in-usagetracker-java\">Espresso Test Failing: No interface method trackUsage() in UsageTracker.java</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44417136/room-persistence-library-run-time-exception-when-calling-rooms-inmemorybuilder-m\">Room Persistence Library run time exception when calling Rooms inMemoryBuilder method</a></p>\n\n<p>But I'm not using Kotlin nor the <code>@Relation</code> annotation, and even when I played with all kinds of different versions in my build.gradle files, it stayed broken. The bright side is, I've learned a lot about that boring part. tl;dr I'm stumped.</p>\n\n<p>Just in case it's helpful context, my app is strongly based on the todo‑mvvm‑databinding example from <a href=\"https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture</a>. I mention this because everything works in the sample, but I've added some complexity and perhaps made a mistake along the way that somebody more experienced will recognize. Particularly, I've mangled that <code>@Entity</code> Goal class (Task in the example app), trying to keep it immutable and adding the builder pattern and several attributes. I'm not done mangling it either -- touched is about to be its own table.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also unskilled in troubleshooting whatever turns an interface and a bunch of annotations into code. Any advice about where to look in resolving this is as useful as the answer it'll lead to. I'm new to Android Studio, Java, and the whole build process.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","eclipse","plugins"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3159259,"reputation":109666,"user_id":2670892,"display_name":"greg-449"},"score":0,"creation_date":1641367441,"post_id":70586854,"comment_id":124783551,"body_markdown":"`org.eclipse.equinox.p2.iu` means a p2 installer &quot;Installation Unit&quot; - a plug-in or feature.

As suggested in the comments I have removed `&lt;version&gt;` from the spring artifacts and removed the tomcat 10 artifacts. I updated the pom.xml file accordingly but the same issue persists.\r\n\r\nWe are working on a Spring Voot application that uses Spring Kafka and embeddedKafka for some unit tests. Recently, kafka-clients requires 3.4.0 to overcome a vulnerability and I updated the version using `&lt;kafka.version&gt;3.4.0&lt;/kafka.version&gt;` in the pom.xml file.\r\n\r\nIf I do this update and run the tests I get the following error:\r\n`Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: kafka.common.KafkaException`\r\nAfter some digging I understand that this usually comes from dependencies version mismatches. This fails all the unit tests that use `@EmbeddedKafka`.\r\n\r\nI do not enforce any versions on the spring-kafka-test artifact and only use the kafka version property in pom.xml, so I let Spring Boot handle the dependencies matches.\r\n\r\nThis is my pom.xml file at the moment (updated)\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;dependencies&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;!--CF

","title":"Updating Kafka version over 3.2.3 crashes embeddedKafka unit tests","body":"<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As suggested in the comments I have removed <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> from the spring artifacts and removed the tomcat 10 artifacts. I updated the pom.xml file accordingly but the same issue persists.</p>\n<p>We are working on a Spring Voot application that uses Spring Kafka and embeddedKafka for some unit tests. Recently, kafka-clients requires 3.4.0 to overcome a vulnerability and I updated the version using <code>&lt;kafka.version&gt;3.4.0&lt;/kafka.version&gt;</code> in the pom.xml file.</p>\n<p>If I do this update and run the tests I get the following error:\n<code>Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: kafka.common.KafkaException</code>\nAfter some digging I understand that this usually comes from dependencies version mismatches. This fails all the unit tests that use <code>@EmbeddedKafka</code>.</p>\n<p>I do not enforce any versions on the spring-kafka-test artifact and only use the kafka version property in pom.xml, so I let Spring Boot handle the dependencies matches.</p>\n<p>This is my pom.xml file at the moment (updated)</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;dependencies&gt;\n        &lt;!--CF

a public static variable for the id?  \r\n\r\nThank you very much in advance for every hint!","title":"Android Studio: how to do an update through user-id without using a global static variable","body":"<p>I am new to programming and to Android Studio.</p>\n<p>I am trying to implement a ProfileActivity for a simple chat-project in which the user is able to update some rows in the User table of a SQLite Database through a simple profile-form after signing up and then signing in in the app.\nThat should appen through the method updateUser() through the query <code>db.update(TABLE_USER, values, COLUMN_USER_ID + &quot; = ?&quot;, new String[]{ String.valueOf(user.getId()) });</code> in the <code>DatabaseHelper</code> Class, as you can see here:</p>\n<pre><code>\n    /**\n     * This method to update user record\n     *\n     * @param user\n     */\n    public void updateUser(User user) {\n        SQLiteDatabase db = this.getWritableDatabase();\n        ContentValues values = new ContentValues();\n        values.put(COLUMN_USER_NAME, user.getName());\n        values.put(COLUMN_USER_CITY, user.getCity());\n        values.put(COLUMN_USER_AGE, user.getAge());\n        values.put(COLUMN_USER_SEX, user.getSex());\n        // updating row\n       db.update(TABLE_USER, values, COLUMN_USER_ID + &quot; = ?&quot;, new String[]{ String.valueOf(user.getId()) });\n\n        db.close();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Anyway I was getting all the time from the User-model an id = 0 and the update did not work.</p>\n<p>Now, after many attempts, I found a (pseudo)solution providing a global public static integer variable &quot;user_id&quot; and accessing it directly in <code>ProfileActivity</code>. The table-update works fine now. Anyway I know that it is a very bad practice against the principles of data encapsulation, as you can see here:</p>\n<p>DatabaseHelper.java</p>\n<pre><code>package

Not, themselves, things that represent stuff and have actual state.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say you really do have 2 sharks (bruce and sheila) and 1 fish (nemo).\r\n\r\nClearly, in such a situation, `nemo.move()` and `bruce.move()` __do completely different things__ - specifically, they cause different state (namely, nemo&#39;s position for `nemo.move()`, and bruce&#39;s for `bruce.move()`) to be used in the calculations and to be affected by the method invocation. They aren&#39;t interchangible at all, and therefore, this:\r\n\r\n&gt; There is however, two functions in SwimmingInTheOcean which require an object of type Shark as well.\r\n\r\nJust doesn&#39;t make sense. Specifically, it doesn&#39;t make sense to see &#39;I have a function that I need to invoke; this will require an object of type Shark&#39;. You don&#39;t &quot;require an object so that some function is available&quot;, you &quot;__require a shark__&quot;, and it&#39;s not specifically about Bruce&#39;s abilities. It&#39;s about poor bruce himself. If you need bruce, you need bruce.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, if the only thing you need bruce for, is things that any fish can do, okay. __You still need bruce__. Objects aren&#39;t interchangible, or, if they are, you&#39;ve go some fairly bizarre design going on, not very OOP-style. If it works, it works, but this question is specifically about code style, and there is rather little point attempting to answer a question that boils down to:\r\n\r\n&quot;I am using this batch of paintbrushes as tools for stirring while I cook a meal. When using the pointed tip brush, should I, as a point of general cooking style, go with a coarse grained weave in the brush, or a fine grained one&quot;? - That&#39;s a silly question. The proper question is: &quot;What are proper cooking implements&quot;. If somehow brushes are all you have, worrying about making it look good is ridiculous.\r\n\r\n&gt; Create both object type Fish and object type Shark in SwimmingInTheOcean. This is what I did.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like all the methods you are interested in are utility methods that do not read or otherwise affect any state _except_ through the parameters you provide, and therefore, should be `static`, and once you&#39;ve done that, this question has the obvious answer. Just invoke the methods you need, simple. No need to create any objects anymore.\r\n\r\n&gt; Create only an object type Shark, because shark already contains all the functions of Fish. The reason why I did not pick this solution however, is because for most intents it looks very weird to use a Shark instead of a Fish. It would mislead someone reading the code in the future.\r\n\r\nThis is misleading. In java, there&#39;s the type of the object and the type of the reference which do not have to be the same thing. This is perfectly legal java code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFish fish = new Shark();\r\n```\r\n\r\nand __very clearly__ communicates to any future readers that at the very least the API of the object is interesting solely for its fish-like properties; the fact that you picked a shark is presumably (as in, that&#39;s what a future reader would assume) relevant in the sense that the &#39;shark&#39; implementation is the way you want the API to be implemented.\r\n\r\nHere, for example, if you have 3 things you need done, and one of the 3 are things you can do with any fish (say, move them to the top of the aquarium so you can catch them with a net), whereas the other is &#39;found the fish friendly club&#39; which is a thing only sharks can do, then you would make 2 methods. Your class is called `SwimmingInTheOcean` which is weird; normally, classes are named to match a tangible concept class, and &#39;swimmingInTheOcean&#39; isn&#39;t it. `Aquarium` or `Ocean`, that makes sense as a name. You&#39;d have:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Ocean {\r\n  void simulateDay() {\r\n    Shark bruce = new Shark();\r\n    foundFishFriendlyClub(bruce);\r\n    chaseToTheNets(bruce);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  void foundFishFriendlyClub(Shark leader) { ... }\r\n  void chaseToTheNets(Fish fish) { .... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere there is no chance that a reader is going to be confused and thinks that somehow chasing into the nets is a thing that applies only to sharks. After all, whilst you call `chaseToTheNets` with a shark, all sharks are fishes, and the `chaseToTheNets` method yells from the rooftops you can do that to any Fish.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s more correct to put the `chaseToTheNets` method in the `Ocean` class instead of the `Fish` class, because it&#39;s an act that a fish itself cannot do (if there is a `FleetOfTrawlers` class, the `chaseToTheNets` method should be there instead of in `Ocean`).\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s possible this advice misses the mark because it doesn&#39;t apply to your situation. However, if that is the case, your chosen example situation (with nemo and fishes and sharks and oceans) isn&#39;t a good way to summarize your situation.\r\n","title":"What is the correct programming practice when needing to initialize both Parent and Child class?","body":"<p>The setup of your question indicates you have much bigger fish to fry, so to speak: Your code doesn't make any sense in the first place.</p>\n<p>Specifically, this part:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Create both object type Fish and object type Shark in SwimmingInTheOcean.
