I don't want to switch to <code>HttpUrlConnection</code> because Retrofit is so elegant and easy to use.</p>\n\n<h2>Edit 1</h2>\n\n<p>I tried providing custom <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> to OkHttp but no time improvement from this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>OkHttpClient.Builder builder = new OkHttpClient.Builder();\nExecutorService exec = new ThreadPoolExecutor(20, 20, 1, TimeUnit.HOURS, new LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;&gt;());\nDispatcher d = new Dispatcher(exec);\nbuilder.dispatcher(d);\nOkHttpClient okHttpClient = builder.build();\nokHttpClient.dispatcher().setMaxRequests(20);\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Edit 2</h2>\n\n<p>I make all requests to the same endpoint, if this matters</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-mvc","jsp"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":699650,"reputation":16447,"user_id":1299005,"display_name":"Mark Thomas"},"score":0,"creation_date":1660724220,"post_id":73325422,"comment_id":129597458,"body_markdown":"Are you using Spring Boot?","body":"Are you using Spring Boot?"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1929456,"reputation":601,"user_id":1739193,"display_name":"btafarelo"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1660724645,"creation_date":1660245916,"answer_id":73325948,"question_id":73325422,"body_markdown":"This syntax is el (expression language) must be explicit enabled.\r\n\r\nIn the jsp add this parameter **isELIgnored=false**\r\n\r\n    &lt;%@ page language=&quot;java&quot;

childLayoutProvider;\r\n\r\n\r\n    public MainLayout(ServiceA a, Service b, Provider&lt;ChildLayout&gt; childLayoutProvider) {...}\r\n\r\n    public void init(MyDTO dto) {\r\n        List&lt;MyDTO&gt; dtos = ...\r\n        for(MyDTO dto : dtos) { \r\n           var childLayout = provier.get();\r\n           childLayout.setDto(dto);\r\n           // child Layout is ready   \r\n        } \r\n\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile in some cases this method works well, one significant drawback is that you break encapsulation of the childLayout and have to set the dto with a setter.\r\n\r\nSo, you need something similar but in a way that can accept a parameter in constructor (unlike `provider.get()`)\r\n\r\nSpring allows this style by using `java.util.Function` as a bean. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Option 2**\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Configuration\r\npublic class MyConfig {\r\n  \r\n   @Bean\r\n   public Function&lt;MyDTO, ChildLayout&gt; beanFactory() {\r\n        return dto -&gt; childLayout(dto);\r\n   } \r\n\r\n   @Bean\r\n   public MainLayout(ServiceA serviceA, ServiceB serviceB, Function&lt;MyDTO, \r\n          ChildLayout&gt; beanFactory) {\r\n       return new MainLayout(serviceA, ServiceB, beanFactory);\r\n   }\r\n   \r\n   @Bean\r\n   @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)\r\n   public ChildLayout childLayout(MyDTO dto\r\n                                  ... /**possibly other parameters **/) {\r\n       return new ChildLayout(dto);\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@AllArgsConstructor\r\npublic class MainLayout {\r\n    private final ServiceA serviceA;\r\n    private final ServiceB serviceB;\r\n    private final Function&lt;MyDTO, ChildLayout&gt;

If a &quot;default&quot; servlet is defined for the application, it will be used. Many containers provide an implicit default servlet for serving content.\r\n\r\nThe &quot;/&quot; URL mapping indicates the default servlet:\r\n\r\n&gt; A string containing only the &quot;/&quot; character *indicates* the &quot;default&quot; servlet of the application. In this case the servlet path is the request URI minus the context path and the path info is null.\r\n\r\nNote that the word &quot;*indicates*&quot; is used, meaning that it is not a requirement.\r\n\r\nThe default servlet is usually used to serve static content, and is usually included in servlet containers, but it&#39;s not a requirement. \r\n\r\nYou can create your own default servlet (thereby overruling the one provided by the servlet container) by mapping a servlet to &quot;/&quot;. Which usually means that it will disable static file serving, unless the selected servlet (or filters) does it. So if you have a simple servlet that only outputs a simple string like &quot;Hello World&quot;, and set it as default servlet by mapping it to &quot;/&quot;, then you disable things like 404 errors, because your simple servlet won&#39;t throw them. So then all (random) url requests that are not handled by more specific URL mappings, will be caught by the simple servlet.\r\n\r\n# Tomcat #\r\nTomcat about their [DefaultServlet][2]:\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; The default servlet is the servlet which serves static resources as well as serves the directory listings (if directory listings are enabled).\r\n\r\nTomcat also says that you can change their default servlet:\r\n\r\n&gt; If you need to change the DefaultServlet settings for an application\r\n&gt; you can override the default configuration by re-defining the\r\n&gt; DefaultServlet in /WEB-INF/web.xml. However, this will cause problems\r\n&gt; if you attempt to deploy the application on another container as the\r\n&gt; DefaultServlet class will not be recognised.\r\n\r\n# Jetty #\r\nJetty also has a [DefaultServlet][3].\r\n\r\n&gt; This servlet, normally mapped to /, provides the handling for static content, OPTION and TRACE methods for the context.\r\n\r\n# Use cases #\r\n## Change default behavior ##\r\nYou can use the DefaultServlet of your container in case you want to modify default behavior of the servlet container in case no url mapping is found.

In that case, you can forward to the DefaultServlet, which usually use the name &quot;default&quot;, although this does make the app a bit container dependent. This can be done by using `ServletContext.getNamedDispatcher(&quot;default&quot;)`\r\n\r\nSo then you get something like this:\r\n\r\n    public void doFilter(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res, FilterChain chain) {\r\n        if (someCondition) {\r\n            // chain to next filter\r\n            chain.doFilter(req, res);\r\n        } else {\r\n            // forward to DefaultServlet, for example, when you don&#39;t want \r\n            // further filters to be applied on the request of a static resource\r\n            req\r\n                    .getServletContext()\r\n                    .getNamedDispatcher(&quot;default&quot;)\r\n                    .forward(req, res);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/jakarta-servlet-spec-5.0.html\r\n  [2]: https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-10.0-doc/default-servlet.html\r\n  [3]: https://javadoc.io/static/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-servlet/11.0.0/org.eclipse.jetty.servlet/org/eclipse/jetty/servlet/DefaultServlet.html","title":"Is the Default Servlet a (de facto) standard?","body":"<h1>Servlet Specification</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/jakarta-servlet-spec-5.0.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Servlet Specification</a> does mention a &quot;default&quot; servlet, but there is no specification for it, it only mentions how the servlet container should use the default servlet in case it exists, but doesn't describe how the default servlet itself should be implemented.</p>\n<p>The Servlet Specification specifies that if there is no URL mapping for a request:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the container will attempt to serve content appropriate for the resource requested.

Now my project can be successfully deployed and shows &quot;Hellow world&quot; index page. But rest service endpoints still return 404 error.\r\n\r\nWhat i have tried to do myself:\r\n1. Add jersey-container-servlet to pom.xml (as i have found an answer to a similiar question stating that a tomcat is a web server and not the application server like glassfish and it needs JAX-RS libraries deployed with the project)\r\n2. Configure web.xml to explicitly define endpoints for the Tomcat in case of some kind of a problem with annotations (obviously a shot in the air as i don&#39;t know the correct way to configure deployment descriptors for RestfullWeb services, but it was worth a try anyway)\r\n```\r\n    &lt;servlet&gt;\r\n        &lt;display-name&gt;Task RESTfull web service&lt;/display-name&gt;\r\n        &lt;servlet-name&gt;TaskService&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\r\n        &lt;servlet-class&gt;com.mycorp.testproject.service.TaskFacadeREST&lt;/servlet-class&gt;\r\n        &lt;init-param&gt;\r\n            &lt;param-name&gt;javax.ws.rs.Application&lt;/param-name&gt;\r\n            &lt;param-value&gt;com.mycorp.testproject.service.ApplicationConfig&lt;/param-value&gt;\r\n        &lt;/init-param&gt;\r\n    &lt;/servlet&gt;\r\n    &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;\r\n        &lt;servlet-name&gt;TaskService&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\r\n        &lt;url-pattern&gt;/webresources/task&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\r\n    &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first option didn&#39;t help a bit, the second returned error that TaskFacadeREST class is not a servlet class.\r\n\r\nNow i&#39;m completely stuck, can&#39;t find any tutorial on deploying JAX-RS endpoints to Tomcat and don&#39;t know which way to go.

I have created a maven java web application and some RESTfull web services from the database (option NEW -&gt; RestFull web services from the database).</p>\n<p>Netbeans created several classes for me like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>@Stateless\n@Path(&quot;task&quot;)\npublic class TaskFacadeREST extends AbstractFacade&lt;Task&gt; {\n\n    @PersistenceContext(unitName = &quot;com.mycorp_testproject_war_1.0-SNAPSHOTPU&quot;)\n    private EntityManager em;\n\n    public TaskFacadeREST() {\n        super(Task.class);\n    }\n\n    @POST\n    @Override\n    @Consumes({MediaType.APPLICATION_XML, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON})\n    public void create(Task entity) {\n        super.create(entity);\n    }\n\nEntity\n@Table(name = &quot;TASK&quot;)\n@NamedQueries({\n    @NamedQuery(name = &quot;Task.findAll&quot;, query = &quot;SELECT t FROM Task t&quot;),\n    @NamedQuery(name = &quot;Task.findById&quot;, query = &quot;SELECT t FROM Task t WHERE t.id = :id&quot;),\n    @NamedQuery(name = &quot;Task.findByProjectId&quot;, query = &quot;SELECT t FROM Task t WHERE t.projectId = :projectId&quot;),\n    @NamedQuery(name = &quot;Task.findByTypeId&quot;, query = &quot;SELECT t FROM Task t WHERE t.typeId = :typeId&quot;)})\npublic class Task implements Serializable {\n\n    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n    @Basic(optional = false)\n    @Column(name = &quot;ID&quot;)\n    private Long id;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And Application Config class:</p>\n<pre><code>@javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath(&quot;webresources&quot;)\npublic class ApplicationConfig extends Application {\n\n    @Override\n    public Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; getClasses() {\n        Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; resources = new java.util.HashSet&lt;&gt;();\n        addRestResourceClasses(resources);\n        return resources;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Do not modify addRestResourceClasses() method.\n     * It is automatically populated with\n     * all resources defined in the project.\n     * If required, comment out calling this method in getClasses().\n     */\n    private void addRestResourceClasses(Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; resources) {\n        resources.add(com.mycorp.testproject.service.LinkTypeFacadeREST.class);\n        resources.add(com.mycorp.testproject.service.ProjectFacadeREST.class);\n        resources.add(com.mycorp.testproject.service.TaskFacadeREST.class);\n        resources.add(com.mycorp.testproject.service.TaskLinkFacadeREST.class);\n        resources.add(com.mycorp.testproject.service.TaskTypeFacadeREST.class);\n    }\n    \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then there were some errors in project path, dependencies, building process, pom.xml and plugin versions that i managed to fix. Now my project can be successfully deployed and shows &quot;Hellow world&quot; index page. But rest service endpoints still return 404 error.</p>\n<p>What i have tried to do myself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add jersey-container-servlet to pom.xml (as i have found an answer to a similiar question stating that a tomcat is a web server and not the application server like glassfish and it needs JAX-RS libraries deployed with the project)</li>\n<li>Configure web.xml to explicitly define endpoints for the Tomcat in case of some kind of a problem with annotations (obviously a shot in the air as i don't know the correct way to configure deployment descriptors for RestfullWeb services, but it was worth a try anyway)</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>    &lt;servlet&gt;\n        &lt;display-name&gt;Task RESTfull web service&lt;/display-name&gt;\n        &lt;servlet-name&gt;TaskService&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\n        &lt;servlet-class&gt;com.mycorp.testproject.service.TaskFacadeREST&lt;/servlet-class&gt;\n        &lt;init-param&gt;\n            &lt;param-name&gt;javax.ws.rs.Application&lt;/param-name&gt;\n            &lt;param-value&gt;com.mycorp.testproject.service.ApplicationConfig&lt;/param-value&gt;\n        &lt;/init-param&gt;\n    &lt;/servlet&gt;\n    &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;\n        &lt;servlet-name&gt;TaskService&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\n        &lt;url-pattern&gt;/webresources/task&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\n    &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first option didn't help a bit, the second returned error that TaskFacadeREST class is not a servlet class.</p>\n<p>Now i'm completely stuck, can't find any tutorial on deploying JAX-RS endpoints to Tomcat and don't know which way to go. Will be gratefull for any info, documentattion or tutorial links on what to do next as netbeans tutorials are based on glassfish and do not contain any info on such problems.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","hibernate","hibernate-types"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1580843,"reputation":13479,"user_id":1466267,"accept_rate":91,"display_name":"SpaceTrucker"},"score":0,"creation_date":1660655852,"post_id":73374601,"comment_id":129579300,"body_markdown":"Please add more of the NPE stacktrace so we know at which location of your code the NPE is thrown.","body":"Please add more of the NPE stacktrace so we know at which location of your code the NPE is thrown."},{"owner":{"account_id":26077349,"reputation":79,"user_id":19776112,"display_name":"justrying"},"score":0,"creation_date":1660656206,"post_id":73374601,"comment_id":129579480,"body_markdown":"@SpaceTrucker I have added where the nullpointer is being thrown","body":"@SpaceTrucker I have added where the nullpointer is being thrown"},{"owner":{"account_id":1580843,"reputation":13479,"user_id":1466267,"accept_rate":91,"display_name":"SpaceTrucker"},"score":0,"creation_date":1660656723,"post_id":73374601,"comment_id":129579731,"body_markdown":"Your problem is probably not related to spring boot but how your json column is mapped in hibernate and what data is being stored in the row you are trying to fetch.

This is because the replacement values we want to use were declared as <code>int</code> data types and the <strong>replaceAll()</strong> method requires String as a replcement argument therefore we take those <code>int</code> values and convert them to String type.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":24975632,"reputation":3,"user_id":18838284,"display_name":"pufferenco"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":73383914,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1660718507,"creation_date":1660679913,"question_id":73379656,"body_markdown":"i have for instance a String : ```if(&#39;{&#39; == &#39;{&#39;){```.\r\ni would want it to not detect the brackets inside the ```&#39; &#39;```\r\nbut i do want it to detect the one at the end which is not inside the quotes \r\nwhat the best way of doing i tried to loop through all chars but is there a quicker method?","title":"how to check for brackets outside two quotes in a String","body":"<p>i have for instance a String : <code>if('{' == '{'){</code>.\ni would want it to not detect the brackets inside the <code>' '</code>\nbut i do want it to detect the one at the end which is not inside the quotes\nwhat the best way of doing i tried to loop through all chars but is there a quicker method?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","gzip","apache-commons","apache-httpclient-4.x","apache-commons-httpclient"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":11089,"reputation":400030,"user_id":21234,"accept_rate":91,"display_name":"skaffman"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":8,"is_accepted":false,"score":8,"last_activity_date":1273096775,"creation_date":1273096775,"answer_id":2777091,"question_id":2777076,"body_markdown":"It has no support for this out-of-the-box, and it seems unlikely to be added to HttpClient 3.x (see rather bitchy JIRA issue [here][1]).

So You can create @Component annotated beans of your business alternatively to the <code>@Configuration</code> annotated classes, spring supports both ways of the bean definitions, in in any case you can inject Configuration Properties, however if you want to &quot;plug in&quot; the configuration properties with <code>@EnableConfigurationProperties</code> you should use it on a <code>@Configuration</code> annotated class.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":25672235,"reputation":11,"user_id":19436285,"display_name":"Aries Zero"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1351,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1660716448,"creation_date":1660713010,"question_id":73383140,"body_markdown":"I have an example here：\r\n```java\r\n@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = &quot;hello&quot;)\r\npublic class MyProperties {\r\n    \r\n    private String name;\r\n\r\n    public String getName() {\r\n        return name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setName(String name) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@EnableConfigurationProperties(MyProperties.class)\r\npublic class MyConfig {\r\n}\r\n```\r\napplication.properties\r\n```xml\r\nhello.name=zhangsan\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy Unit test：\r\n```java\r\n@SpringBootTest\r\nclass SpringLearnApplicationTests {\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    private MyProperties myProperties;\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void contextLoads() {\r\n        System.out.println(myProperties.getName()); \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd then there&#39;s an anomaly:\r\n\r\n`Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No qualifying bean of type &#39;com.github.spring_learn.conf.MyProperties&#39; available: expected at least 1 bean which qualifies as autowire candidate.

It accomplishes 2 major objectives. Before getting into that, let&#39;s first stew on the notion of negative zero for a moment.\r\n\r\n## Negative zero is kinda weird. Why does it exist at all?\r\n\r\nNegative zero isn&#39;t actually a thing. Ask any mathematician &quot;Hey, so, what&#39;s up with negative zero?&quot; and they&#39;ll just look at you in befuddlement. It&#39;s not a thing. Mathematically, 0 and -0 are utterly identical. Not just &#39;nearly identical&#39;, but __100%, fully, in all possible ways, identical__. We don&#39;t generally want our numbers to be capable of representing both `5.0` as well as `5.00` - as those two are entirely, 100%, identical. If you don&#39;t think that a value system ought to waste bits trying to differentiate between `5.0` and `5.00`, then it&#39;s equally bizarro to want the ability to represent `-0.0` and `+0.0` as distinct entities.\r\n\r\nSo, _wanting_ `-0` in the first place is kinda weird. All the numeric primitives (`long`, `int`, `short`, `byte`, and I guess `char` which is technically numeric too) all __cannot__ represent this number. Instead, `long z = -0` boils down to:\r\n\r\n* Take the constant &quot;0&quot;.\r\n* Apply the &#39;negate&#39; operation to this number (`-` is a unary operator. Just like `2+5` makes the system calculate the binary operation of &quot;addition&quot; on elements 2 and 5, `-x` makes the system calculate the unary operation of &quot;negation&quot; on element `x`. Applying the negation operation to 0 produces 0. It&#39;s no different from writing, say, `int x = 5 + 0;`. That `+0` part doesn&#39;t do anything. The `-` in front of `-0` doesn&#39;t do anything. In contrast to `-0.0` where it does do something (gets you negative zero, the `double` value, instead of positive zero).\r\n* Store this result in `z` (so, just 0 then).\r\n\r\nThere is __no way__ to tell if that minus is there. They both result in ALL ZERO bits, and hence, there is no way for the computer to tell if you initialized that variable with the expression `-0` or with `+0`. Again in contrast to `double` where as you noticed there&#39;s a bit different.\r\n\r\n### So why does `double` have it then?\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s stew a bit on the notion of doubles and IEEE-754 math.\r\n\r\nA `double` takes 64 bits. From basic pure mathematical principles then, a double is as incapable of representing more than 2^64 different possible values you are capable of breaking the speed of light or making `1+1=3`.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, a `double` aims to represent _all numbers_. There are way more numbers between 0 and 1 than 2^64 options (in fact, an infinite amount of numbers exist between 0 and 1), and that&#39;s just 0 to 1.\r\n\r\nSo, how doubles actually work is different. A few less than 2^64 numbers are chosen from the entire number line. Let&#39;s call these _the blessed numbers_.\r\n\r\nThe blessed numbers are not equally distributed. The closer you are to `1`, the more blessed numbers exist. In other words, the __distance__ between 2 blessed numbers increases as you move away from 1. For example, if you go from, say, 1e100 (a 1 with a hundred zeroes) and want to find the next blessed number, it&#39;s quite a ways. It&#39;s in fact __higher than 1.0!__ - `1e100+1` __is in fact 1e100 again__, because the way `double` math works is that after every single last mathematical operation you to do them, the end result is _rounded to the nearest blessed number_.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s try it!\r\n\r\n```java\r\ndouble d = 1e100;\r\nSystem.out.println(d);\r\nSystem.out.println(d + 1);\r\n\r\n// prints: 1.0E100\r\n//         1.0E100\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that means.. `double` values don&#39;t _actually represent a single number!!_. What any given double represents is in fact this concept:\r\n\r\n&gt; An unknown number whose value lies between [D - &#120575;, D + &#120575;], where D is the blessed number that is closed to this unknown number this value represents, and, and &#120575; is half of the distance between D and the next nearest blessed number on either side.\r\n\r\nGiven that usually &#120575; is incredibly small, this is &#39;good enough&#39;. But this weirdness does explain why you really, really do not want any business at all with `double` if accuracy is important (such as with currencies. Don&#39;t store those in doubles, ever!)\r\n\r\nGiven that, what does `-0.0` represent? not actually _just_ 0. It represents, specifically: An unknown number whose value lies between [-&#120575;, 0] where 0 is real zero (and this, has no sign), and &#120575; is `Double.MIN_VALUE`: the smallest non-zero positive number representable with a `double`.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why `-0.0` and `+0.0` both exist: They are in fact different concepts. Rarely relevant, but sometimes it is. In contrast to e.g. `long` where `5` just means `5` and not &quot;between 4.5 and 5.5&quot;, because longs fundamentally don&#39;t recognize that fractional parts exist in the first place. Given that `5` just means `5`, then `0` just means `0`, and there __is no such thing as negative zero in the first place__.\r\n\r\n## Now we get to 2&#39;s complement\r\n\r\n2&#39;s complement is a cool system. It has two neat properties:\r\n\r\n* It only has the one zero.\r\n* It does not matter if you treat the bit sequence as signed-by-way-of-2s-complement or as unsigned, for the purposes of the operations: Addition, Substraction, Increment, Decrement, zero-check. The modifications you do to the bits to implement those operations is identical.\r\n\r\nIt DOES matter for greater than, less than, and divide.\r\n\r\n2&#39;s complement works like this: To negate a number, take all bits and flip them (i.e. do a NOT operation on the bits). Then, add 1.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s try it!\r\n\r\n```\r\nint x = 5;\r\nint y = -x;\r\nfor (int i = 31; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\r\n    System.out.print((x &gt;&gt;&gt; i) &amp; 1);\r\n}\r\nSystem.out.println();\r\nfor (int i = 31; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\r\n    System.out.print((y &gt;&gt;&gt; i) &amp; 1);\r\n}\r\nSystem.out.println();\r\n\r\n// prints 00000000000000000000000000000101\r\n//        11111111111111111111111111111011\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs we can see, the &#39;flip all bits and add 1&#39; algorithm was applied.\r\n\r\n2s complement is, of course, reversible: If you do &#39;flip all bits and add 1&#39; twice in a row you get the same number out.\r\n\r\nNow let&#39;s try `-0`. 0 is 32 0 bits, then flip them all, then add 1:\r\n\r\n```\r\n 00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n 11111111111111111111111111111111 // flip all\r\n100000000000000000000000000000000 // add 1\r\n 00000000000000000000000000000000 // that 1 fell off\r\n```\r\n\r\nand because ints can only store 32 bits, that final &#39;1&#39; falls off of the end. And we&#39;re left with zero again.\r\n\r\nNow let&#39;s go with bytes ( abit smaller) and try to add, say, 200 and 50 together.\r\n\r\n```\r\n11001000 // 200 in binary\r\n00110010 // 50 in binary\r\n-------- +\r\n11111010 // 250 in binary.\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow let&#39;s instead go: Oh wait, whoops, that was an error, actually these numbers are in 2s complement. That wasn&#39;t 200, nono. 11001000 is a bit sequence that actually means (let&#39;s apply the &#39;flip all bits, add 1&#39; scheme: 00111000 - it&#39;s actually -56. So the operation was meant to represent &#39;-56 + 50&#39;. Which is -6. -6 in binary is (write out 6, flip bits, add 1):\r\n\r\n```\r\n00000110\r\n11111001\r\n11111010\r\n```\r\nhey now, look at that, nothing changed! It&#39;s the same result! So, when the computer does `x + y`, where x and y are numbers, the computer __does not care__. Whether x is &quot;an unsigned number&quot; or &quot;a signed with 2s complement number&quot;, the operation is identical.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why 2s complement is applied. It makes math MUCH faster. The CPU doesn&#39;t have to futz about with branching out to deal with sign bits.\r\n\r\nIn this sense it is more correct to say that in java, `int`, `long`, `char`, `byte` and `short` are neither signed nor unsigned, they just are. At least for the purposes of +, -, ++, and --. No the idea that `int` is signed is fundamentally a property of e.g. `System.out.println(int)` - that method chooses to render the bitsequence 11111111111111111111111111111111 as &quot;-1&quot; instead of as 4294967296.\r\n","title":"Long Representation vs Double representation of positive and negative zero in java","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>or is there other magic here?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes. 2's complement.</p>\n<p>2's complement is a bit magical.

In contrast to <code>-0.0</code> where it does do something (gets you negative zero, the <code>double</code> value, instead of positive zero).</li>\n<li>Store this result in <code>z</code> (so, just 0 then).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is <strong>no way</strong> to tell if that minus is there. They both result in ALL ZERO bits, and hence, there is no way for the computer to tell if you initialized that variable with the expression <code>-0</code> or with <code>+0</code>. Again in contrast to <code>double</code> where as you noticed there's a bit different.</p>\n<h3>So why does <code>double</code> have it then?</h3>\n<p>Let's stew a bit on the notion of doubles and IEEE-754 math.</p>\n<p>A <code>double</code> takes 64 bits. From basic pure mathematical principles then, a double is as incapable of representing more than 2^64 different possible values you are capable of breaking the speed of light or making <code>1+1=3</code>.</p>\n<p>And yet, a <code>double</code> aims to represent <em>all numbers</em>. There are way more numbers between 0 and 1 than 2^64 options (in fact, an infinite amount of numbers exist between 0 and 1), and that's just 0 to 1.</p>\n<p>So, how doubles actually work is different. A few less than 2^64 numbers are chosen from the entire number line. Let's call these <em>the blessed numbers</em>.</p>\n<p>The blessed numbers are not equally distributed. The closer you are to <code>1</code>, the more blessed numbers exist. In other words, the <strong>distance</strong> between 2 blessed numbers increases as you move away from 1. For example, if you go from, say, 1e100 (a 1 with a hundred zeroes) and want to find the next blessed number, it's quite a ways. It's in fact <strong>higher than 1.0!</strong> - <code>1e100+1</code> <strong>is in fact 1e100 again</strong>, because the way <code>double</code> math works is that after every single last mathematical operation you to do them, the end result is <em>rounded to the nearest blessed number</em>.</p>\n<p>Let's try it!</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>double d = 1e100;\nSystem.out.println(d);\nSystem.out.println(d + 1);\n\n// prints: 1.0E100\n//         1.0E100\n</code></pre>\n<p>But that means.. <code>double</code> values don't <em>actually represent a single number!!</em>. What any given double represents is in fact this concept:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An unknown number whose value lies between [D - 𝛿, D + 𝛿], where D is the blessed number that is closed to this unknown number this value represents, and, and 𝛿 is half of the distance between D and the next nearest blessed number on either side.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given that usually 𝛿 is incredibly small, this is 'good enough'. But this weirdness does explain why you really, really do not want any business at all with <code>double</code> if accuracy is important (such as with currencies. Don't store those in doubles, ever!)</p>\n<p>Given that, what does <code>-0.0</code> represent? not actually <em>just</em> 0. It represents, specifically: An unknown number whose value lies between [-𝛿, 0] where 0 is real zero (and this, has no sign), and 𝛿 is <code>Double.MIN_VALUE</code>: the smallest non-zero positive number representable with a <code>double</code>.</p>\n<p>That's why <code>-0.0</code> and <code>+0.0</code> both exist: They are in fact different concepts. Rarely relevant, but sometimes it is. In contrast to e.g. <code>long</code> where <code>5</code> just means <code>5</code> and not &quot;between 4.5 and 5.5&quot;, because longs fundamentally don't recognize that fractional parts exist in the first place. Given that <code>5</code> just means <code>5</code>, then <code>0</code> just means <code>0</code>, and there <strong>is no such thing as negative zero in the first place</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Now we get to 2's complement</h2>\n<p>2's complement is a cool system. It has two neat properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It only has the one zero.</li>\n<li>It does not matter if you treat the bit sequence as signed-by-way-of-2s-complement or as unsigned, for the purposes of the operations: Addition, Substraction, Increment, Decrement, zero-check. The modifications you do to the bits to implement those operations is identical.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It DOES matter for greater than, less than, and divide.</p>\n<p>2's complement works like this: To negate a number, take all bits and flip them (i.e. do a NOT operation on the bits). Then, add 1.</p>\n<p>Let's try it!</p>\n<pre><code>int x = 5;\nint y = -x;\nfor (int i = 31; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\n    System.out.print((x &gt;&gt;&gt; i) &amp; 1);\n}\nSystem.out.println();\nfor (int i = 31; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\n    System.out.print((y &gt;&gt;&gt; i) &amp; 1);\n}\nSystem.out.println();\n\n// prints 00000000000000000000000000000101\n//        11111111111111111111111111111011\n</code></pre>\n<p>As we can see, the 'flip all bits and add 1' algorithm was applied.</p>\n<p>2s complement is, of course, reversible: If you do 'flip all bits and add 1' twice in a row you get the same number out.</p>\n<p>Now let's try <code>-0</code>. 0 is 32 0 bits, then flip them all, then add 1:</p>\n<pre><code> 00000000000000000000000000000000\n 11111111111111111111111111111111 // flip all\n100000000000000000000000000000000 // add 1\n 00000000000000000000000000000000 // that 1 fell off\n</code></pre>\n<p>and because ints can only store 32 bits, that final '1' falls off of the end. And we're left with zero again.</p>\n<p>Now let's go with bytes ( abit smaller) and try to add, say, 200 and 50 together.</p>\n<pre><code>11001000 // 200 in binary\n00110010 // 50 in binary\n-------- +\n11111010 // 250 in binary.\n</code></pre>\n<p>now let's instead go: Oh wait, whoops, that was an error, actually these numbers are in 2s complement. That wasn't 200, nono. 11001000 is a bit sequence that actually means (let's apply the 'flip all bits, add 1' scheme: 00111000 - it's actually -56. So the operation was meant to represent '-56 + 50'. Which is -6. -6 in binary is (write out 6, flip bits, add 1):</p>\n<pre><code>00000110\n11111001\n11111010\n</code></pre>\n<p>hey now, look at that, nothing changed! It's the same result! So, when the computer does <code>x + y</code>, where x and y are numbers, the computer <strong>does not care</strong>. Whether x is &quot;an unsigned number&quot; or &quot;a signed with 2s complement number&quot;, the operation is identical.</p>\n<p>That's why 2s complement is applied. It makes math MUCH faster. The CPU doesn't have to futz about with branching out to deal with sign bits.</p>\n<p>In this sense it is more correct to say that in java, <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>byte</code> and <code>short</code> are neither signed nor unsigned, they just are. At least for the purposes of +, -, ++, and --. No the idea that <code>int</code> is signed is fundamentally a property of e.g. <code>System.out.println(int)</code> - that method chooses to render the bitsequence 11111111111111111111111111111111 as &quot;-1&quot; instead of as 4294967296.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":412591,"reputation":4348,"user_id":785736,"accept_rate":51,"display_name":"Mr T."},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":269,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1660712346,"creation_date":1660699065,"question_id":73381907,"body_markdown":"I was wondering about the differences between positive and negative zero in different numeric types. &lt;br/&gt;\r\nI understand the IEEE-754 for floating point arithmetic and bit representation in double precision so the following didn&#39;t come as a surprise\r\n```\r\ndouble posz = 0.0;\r\ndouble negz = -0.0;\r\nSystem.out.println(Long.toBinaryString(Double.doubleToLongBits(posz)));\r\nSystem.out.println(Long.toBinaryString(Double.doubleToLongBits(negz)));\r\n// output\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 0\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n```\r\nWhat did surprise me and showed me that im clueless about the bit representation of ```long``` type in java is that even if i shift right (unsigned ```&gt;&gt;&gt;```) then the binary representation of both positive and negative zero is the same \r\n```\r\nlong posz = 0L;\r\nlong negz = -0L;\r\nfor (int i = 63; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\r\n    System.out.print((posz &gt;&gt;&gt; i) &amp; 1);\r\n}\r\nSystem.out.println();\r\nfor (int i = 63; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\r\n    System.out.print((negz &gt;&gt;&gt; i) &amp; 1);\r\n}\r\n// output\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\r\n```\r\nso i am wondering what does java do from a bit representation when i write the following\r\n```\r\nlong posz = 0L;\r\nlong negz = -0L;\r\n```\r\nDoes the compiler understand that they are both zero and disregards the sign (and so assignes 0 to the sign bit) or is there other magic here?","title":"Long Representation vs Double representation of positive and negative zero in java","body":"<p>I was wondering about the differences between positive and negative zero in different numeric types. <br/>\nI understand the IEEE-754 for floating point arithmetic and bit representation in double precision so the following didn't come as a surprise</p>\n<pre><code>double posz = 0.0;\ndouble negz = -0.0;\nSystem.out.println(Long.toBinaryString(Double.doubleToLongBits(posz)));\nSystem.out.println(Long.toBinaryString(Double.doubleToLongBits(negz)));\n// output\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n</code></pre>\n<p>What did surprise me and showed me that im clueless about the bit representation of <code>long</code> type in java is that even if i shift right (unsigned <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>) then the binary representation of both positive and negative zero is the same</p>\n<pre><code>long posz = 0L;\nlong negz = -0L;\nfor (int i = 63; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\n    System.out.print((posz &gt;&gt;&gt; i) &amp; 1);\n}\nSystem.out.println();\nfor (int i = 63; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\n    System.out.print((negz &gt;&gt;&gt; i) &amp; 1);\n}\n// output\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n</code></pre>\n<p>so i am wondering what does java do from a bit representation when i write the following</p>\n<pre><code>long posz = 0L;\nlong negz = -0L;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Does the compiler understand that they are both zero and disregards the sign (and so assignes 0 to the sign bit) or is there other magic here?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","caching","redis","spring-data-redis"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":9225619,"reputation":1240,"user_id":9107502,"display_name":"0x1C1B"},"score":0,"creation_date":1660291461,"post_id":73275520,"comment_id":129502682,"body_markdown":"Maybe [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51308129/9107502) may help.

I haven&#39;t looked at the Java 8 native method&#39;s implementation.  It might already have been a no-op.\r\n\r\nFrom Java 9 onwards it simply checks that the argument `c` is not `null`.  So ... now, the answer is clearly No.\r\n\r\nThere were significant changes to the implementations of classloaders between Java 8 and 9 (see https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/9-all-relnotes.html).  This were due in part to the need to support Java 9 modules.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the Java 9 classloader changes made the `resolveClass` method either redundant or unhelpful .  But rather than causing rework for people with custom classloaders, the Java team simply turned the method into a no-op.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the javadoc comment says:\r\n\r\n&gt; Links the specified class.  This (misleadingly named) method may be\r\n&gt; used by a class loader to link a class.  If the class `c` has\r\n&gt; already been linked, then this method simply returns. Otherwise, the\r\n&gt; class is linked as described in the &quot;Execution&quot; chapter of &quot;The Java Language Specification&quot;.\r\n\r\nI can think of two possible explanations for making the method a no-op now:\r\n\r\n  1.

On previous versions I had a state machine in charge of that focusing on the preview by means of a separate CaptureRequest.Builder, but I can't make it work without creating a new CaptureRequest.Builder on the service.</p>\n<p>I followed this topic on the following stackoverflow discussion <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42127464/how-to-lock-focus-in-camera2-api-android\">How to lock focus in camera2 api, android?</a> but I did not manage to make it work.</p>\n<p>My code does the following:\nFirst I create a camera session once the camera has been opened.</p>\n<pre><code>public void createCameraSession() {\n    try {\n        // Here, we create a CameraCaptureSession for camera preview.\n        cameraDevice.createCaptureSession(Arrays.asList(imageReader.getSurface()),\n                new CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback() {\n\n                    @Override\n                    public void onConfigured(@NonNull CameraCaptureSession cameraCaptureSession) {\n                        // The camera is already closed\n                        if (null == cameraDevice) {\n                            return;\n                        }\n\n                        // When the session is ready, we start displaying the preview.\n                        mCaptureSession = cameraCaptureSession;\n\n                        camera2TakePicture();\n                    }\n\n                    @Override\n                    public void onConfigureFailed(\n                            @NonNull CameraCaptureSession cameraCaptureSession) {\n                    }\n                }, null\n        );\n    } catch (CameraAccessException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then on that camera session I call my method &quot;camera2TakePicture()&quot;:</p>\n<pre><code>protected void camera2TakePicture() {\n    if (null == cameraDevice) {\n        return;\n    }\n    try {\n        Surface readerSurface = imageReader.getSurface();\n        List&lt;Surface&gt;

I add a check on onCaptureCompleted() but the AF_STATE never seems to be on FOCUSED_LOCKED. It stays on ACTIVE_SCAN.</p>\n<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>\n"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":8887,"page":1105,"page_size":100}
