That means when you call `zip(s1, s2, f)`, it&#39;s not _consuming_ the input streams; it&#39;s just returning a _wrapper_ stream that reads from each input on demand and merges the results. Another key to keep in mind is that `reduce()` only processes two elements at a time. Say you have 4 streams and want to reduce them by hand; it would look something like this:\r\n\r\n    Stream&lt;T&gt; m1 = merge(s1, s2);\r\n    Stream&lt;T&gt; m2 = merge(m1, s3);\r\n    Stream&lt;T&gt; m3 = merge(m2, s4);\r\n\r\nNow, consider what happens when you want to read a single element from the final merged stream. `m3` has to request an element from `s4` and one from `m2`, which in turn requires elements from `s3` and `m1`, which in turn requires elements from `s2` and `s1`, all in a single call stack. Stretch that out [too far][2] and you&#39;ll hit the maximum number of nested calls, resulting in a stack overflow.\r\n\r\nI suspect this is an [XY Problem][3] and there&#39;s a cleaner way to achieve what you want that doesn&#39;t involve lazy merging of streams.

In my case, I was configuring a grpc client to be retriable, which is done via [ManagedChannelBuilder.defaultServiceConfig][6] API. The API accepts a `Map&lt;String, ?&gt;` with [this][7] format.\r\n\r\nAfter several trials and errors, I figured that the defaultServiceConfig API assumes you are using GSON, hence the [serialize/deserialize][1] approach worked for me.\r\n\r\nOne more advantage of the [serialize/deserialize][1] approach is that the `Map&lt;String, ?&gt;` can be easily converted back to the original protobuf value by serializing it back to json, then using the `JsonFormat.parser()` to obtain the protobuf object:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    ServiceConfig original;\r\n    ...\r\n    String asJson = JsonFormat.printer().print(original);\r\n    Map&lt;String, ?&gt;

For example:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\nimport java.lang.reflect.Method;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.BeforeEachCallback;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtensionContext;\r\n// import logger..\r\n\r\npublic class MyExtension implements BeforeEachCallback {\r\n\r\n    final Logger logger = ...;\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void beforeEach(ExtensionContext context) {\r\n        logger.info(&quot;STARTING test: &quot; + context.getTestMethod().map(Method::getName).orElse(null));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen apply your extension:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith;\r\n\r\n@ExtendWith(MyExtension.class)\r\nclass XXXTests {\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void testFoo() {\r\n        // perform assertions\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour extension class can implement multiple extension interfaces. If you want to watch for success and failure, then you can also implement [`org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.TestWatcher`][1], but note that interface only became stable API in JUnit 5.7 (I believe it was added in version 5.4).\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/extension/TestWatcher.html\r\n  [2]: https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/extension/BeforeEachCallback.html\r\n  [3]: https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/BeforeEach.html\r\n  [4]: https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/TestInfo.html\r\n  [5]: https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/","title":"How to replace @Rule in JUNIT5","body":"<p>For more information about JUnit 5, I suggest reading the <a href=\"https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JUnit 5 User Guide</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In JUnit 5, if you want to execute a method before each test, then you can use the <a href=\"https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/BeforeEach.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>@BeforeEach</code></a> annotation.

But, as defined on the Component Overview:\r\n\r\n&gt;poi-ooxml requires poi-ooxml-lite\r\n\r\nWhich means that, in order to use the former you have to add the latter.

However, if you DO need them (like me), you will end up incorring in the problem of this question. That&#39;s because, as said before, `poi-ooxml` requires `poi-ooxml-lite` to work (and, therefore, is downloaded by gradle when you build your project) but plenty of the classes present in the lite version are ALSO present in the full version.\r\n\r\nSo, in order to solve the problem of duplicate classes, I used the gradle configuration and defined the exclusion of the `poi-ooxml-lite` module, since all classes inside it are present inside the `poi-ooxml-full` module as well.\r\n\r\nMy build.gradle(:app) file looks like this\r\n\r\n````kotlin\r\nplugins {\r\n    id &#39;com.android.application&#39;\r\n}\r\n\r\nandroid {\r\n    ...\r\n    defaultConfig {\r\n     ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    configurations {\r\n        all {\r\n            exclude group: &#39;org.apache.poi&#39;, module: &#39;poi-ooxml-lite&#39;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ndependencies {\r\n...\r\n    implementation &#39;org.apache.poi:poi-ooxml:5.2.3&#39;\r\n    implementation &#39;org.apache.poi:poi-ooxml-full:5.2.3&#39;\r\n...\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nThat being said, Apache POI surely could have made a more intuitive guide or FAQ for some of their modules.
