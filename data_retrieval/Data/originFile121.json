As [Adrian Shum commented](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28687713/hashcode-implementation-on-boolean-fields#comment45667885_28687713), [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/113600/395202) provides an overview of a &quot;general hashing algorithm&quot; which is designed to be effective independent of what you are trying to hash.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to multiply a simplified hash value for each type by some arbitrarily large prime number to ensure that each hash is unique (though the proof for this eludes me). For example:\r\n\r\n    int result = 0;\r\n    result = 31*result + bool1 ? 1 : 0;\r\n    result = 31*result + bool2 ? 1 : 0;\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nFor an even more sparse hash distribution, you can combine this with [`Boolean.hashCode`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3912303/boolean-hashcode), as the other answers show:\r\n\r\n    int result = 0;\r\n    result += 31*result + bool1.hashCode();\r\n    result += 31*result + bool2.hashCode();\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s great about this solution is that it can be applied to other types, like you already have in your sample code:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    result = 31*result + i;\r\n    result = 31*result + (a != null ? a.hashCode() : 0);\r\n    result = 31*result + my_complex_object.hashCode();\r\n\r\n**Note**: In these examples, `31` is just some arbitrary prime.

Create a `Region` that will act as a spacer between your label and buttons.\r\n 2. Use `HBox.setHgrow` to make the `Region` take up all the available space.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a code example:\r\n\r\n\r\n    import javafx.application.Application;\r\n    import javafx.scene.Scene;\r\n    import javafx.scene.control.Button;\r\n    import javafx.scene.control.Label;\r\n    import javafx.scene.layout.HBox;\r\n    import javafx.scene.layout.Priority;\r\n    import javafx.scene.layout.Region;\r\n    import javafx.stage.Stage;\r\n    \r\n    public class Main extends Application {\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void start(Stage primaryStage) {\r\n            Label label = new Label(&quot;Or lots and lots and lots of text.&quot;);\r\n            \r\n            Button buttonX = new Button(&quot;buttonX&quot;);\r\n            Button buttonY = new Button(&quot;buttonY&quot;);\r\n            \r\n            // Create a region to act as a horizontal spacer\r\n            Region spacer = new Region();\r\n            \r\n            // Make the spacer Region expand as much as possible\r\n            HBox.setHgrow(spacer, Priority.ALWAYS);\r\n            \r\n            HBox hbox = new HBox(label, spacer, buttonX, buttonY);\r\n            \r\n            Scene scene = new Scene(hbox, 400, 100);\r\n            \r\n            primaryStage.setScene(scene);\r\n            primaryStage.show();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            launch(args);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn this example, the `Region` named `spacer` will take up all the extra horizontal space in the `HBox`, pushing your buttons to the far right.

This ensures your buttons remain on the far right regardless of the label's width.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":322981,"reputation":310744,"user_id":642706,"accept_rate":58,"display_name":"Basil Bourque"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":98,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":77299349,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1697438705,"creation_date":1697428811,"question_id":77299333,"body_markdown":"In JavaFX 21, I want an `HBox` to contain 3 elements, a label and two buttons. \r\n\r\n    HBox rowBox = new HBox ( label , buttonX , buttonY );\r\n\r\nBy default, the widgets all pile up to the left. \r\n\r\nLike this with little text, if we imagine my outer square brackets to be the `HBox` boundaries, and inner square brackets to be the boundaries of each button:\r\n\r\n&gt;`[ Short text.

Its main applications involve data transmission through networks or between applications&#39; many layers. DTOs typically have private fields as well as getter and setter methods for gaining access to the data they hold. Notably, DTOs act as a means of information interchange between the display layer and the business logic layer of an application but lack business logic or validation procedures.\r\n\r\n**VO (Value Object)**\r\n\r\nValue Objects (VOs), which are used for data transport, are similar to DTOs. However, as opposed to data that is kept in databases or transmitted between processes, VOs are expressly used to represent data that is accessible to the user. In actual use, VOs are positioned in an application&#39;s display layer. They might also incorporate further techniques designed to improve the user interface through data formatting or manipulation.\r\n\r\n**POJO (Plain Old Java Object) :**\r\n\r\nPlain Old Java Objects, or POJOs, are basic Java entities without any unique methods or characteristics. They provide accessor methods and private fields for modifying and retrieving data. POJOs serve as basic data bearers and could act as DTOs or VOs.\r\n\r\n**JavaBeans:**\r\n\r\nJavaBeans are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean). Contrarily, JavaBeans follow particular naming and access standards. These objects offer public getter and setter methods for gaining access to data attributes as well as private fields. Consistent and portable data representation is ensured via JavaBeans.

Its main applications involve data transmission through networks or between applications' many layers. DTOs typically have private fields as well as getter and setter methods for gaining access to the data they hold. Notably, DTOs act as a means of information interchange between the display layer and the business logic layer of an application but lack business logic or validation procedures.</p>\n<p><strong>VO (Value Object)</strong></p>\n<p>Value Objects (VOs), which are used for data transport, are similar to DTOs. However, as opposed to data that is kept in databases or transmitted between processes, VOs are expressly used to represent data that is accessible to the user. In actual use, VOs are positioned in an application's display layer. They might also incorporate further techniques designed to improve the user interface through data formatting or manipulation.</p>\n<p><strong>POJO (Plain Old Java Object) :</strong></p>\n<p>Plain Old Java Objects, or POJOs, are basic Java entities without any unique methods or characteristics. They provide accessor methods and private fields for modifying and retrieving data. POJOs serve as basic data bearers and could act as DTOs or VOs.</p>\n<p><strong>JavaBeans:</strong></p>\n<p>JavaBeans are classes that encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean). Contrarily, JavaBeans follow particular naming and access standards. These objects offer public getter and setter methods for gaining access to data attributes as well as private fields. Consistent and portable data representation is ensured via JavaBeans. Through a variety of tools and frameworks, they also make serialization, deserialization, and accessibility easier.</p>\n<p><em>For more detail information, the following contents provide clear concept.</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/java-dto-pattern\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The DTO Pattern</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dzone.com/articles/value-objects\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Value Objects</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.javatpoint.com/pojo-in-java\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">POJO in JAVA</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/java/javabeans\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JavaBeans</a></li>\n</ol>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":52759,"reputation":21589,"user_id":157705,"accept_rate":74,"display_name":"jai"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":565334,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":679,"accepted_answer_id":1612671,"answer_count":9,"score":677,"last_activity_date":1697437999,"creation_date":1256290236,"question_id":1612334,"body_markdown":"Have seen some similar questions:\r\n\r\n * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1394265/what-is-the-difference-between-a-javabean-and-a-pojo\r\n * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1425302/what-is-the-difference-between-pojo-and-dto\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you also please tell me the contexts in which they are used?

Mock method `mainModel.getList()` is called,\r\n2. Static method `when` is called,\r\n3. A new `mock` of `SomeModel` is created (inside `getSomeList()`),\r\n4. Mock method `model.getName()` is called,\r\n\r\nAt this point Mockito gets confused.  It thought you were mocking `mainModel.getList()`, but now you&#39;re telling it you want to mock the `model.getName()` method.  To Mockito, it looks like you&#39;re doing the following:\r\n\r\n    when(mainModel.getList());\r\n    // ...\r\n    when(model.getName()).thenReturn(...);\r\n\r\nThis looks silly to `Mockito` as it can&#39;t be sure what you&#39;re doing with `mainModel.getList()`.\r\n\r\nNote that we did not get to the `thenReturn` method call, as the JVM needs to evaluate the parameters to this method before it can call the method.  In this case, this means calling the `getSomeList()` method.\r\n\r\nGenerally it is a bad design decision to rely on static state, as Mockito does, because it can lead to cases where the Principle of Least Astonishment is violated.  However, Mockito&#39;s design does make for clear and expressive mocking, even if it leads to astonishment sometimes.\r\n\r\nFinally, recent versions of Mockito add an extra line to the error message above.

Please do comment if this does not help you understand.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":27211201,"reputation":1,"user_id":20741999,"display_name":"yong _ta_Park"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1697426898,"creation_date":1697422278,"question_id":77299078,"body_markdown":"gradle\r\n```\r\nplugins {\r\n    id &#39;java&#39;\r\n    id &#39;org.springframework.boot&#39; version &#39;3.1.3&#39;\r\n    id &#39;io.spring.dependency-management&#39; version &#39;1.1.3&#39;\r\n}\r\n\r\ngroup = &#39;com.example&#39;\r\nversion = &#39;0.0.1-SNAPSHOT&#39;\r\n\r\njava {\r\n    sourceCompatibility = &#39;17&#39;\r\n}\r\n\r\nconfigurations {\r\n    compileOnly {\r\n        extendsFrom annotationProcessor\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nrepositories {\r\n    mavenCentral()\r\n}\r\n\r\ndependencies {\r\n    implementation &#39;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa&#39;\r\n    compileOnly &#39;org.projectlombok:lombok&#39;\r\n    runtimeOnly &#39;org.mariadb.jdbc:mariadb-java-client&#39;\r\n    annotationProcessor &#39;org.projectlombok:lombok&#39;\r\n    testImplementation &#39;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test&#39;\r\n    testCompileOnly &#39;org.projectlombok:lombok&#39;\r\n    testAnnotationProcessor &#39;org.projectlombok:lombok&#39;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntasks.named(&#39;test&#39;) {\r\n    useJUnitPlatform()\r\n}\r\n```\r\nentity\r\n```\r\n@Entity\r\n@Getter\r\n@Setter\r\npublic class Child {\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;member_id&quot;)\r\n    private Long id;\r\n    private String name;\r\n\r\n    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\r\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;parent_id&quot;)\r\n    private Parent parent;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Entity\r\n@Getter\r\n@Setter\r\npublic class Parent {\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;member_id&quot;)\r\n    private Long id;\r\n    private String name;\r\n    @OneToMany(mappedBy = &quot;parent&quot;, orphanRemoval = true)\r\n    private List&lt;Child&gt; childList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n    public void addChild(Child child){\r\n        childList.add(child);\r\n        child.setParent(this);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\ntestCode\r\n```\r\n@Test\r\n@Transactional\r\n@Rollback(value = false)\r\nvoid name() {\r\n    Child child1 = new Child();\r\n    child1.setName(&quot;child1&quot;);\r\n\r\n    Parent parent = new Parent();\r\n    parent.addChild(child1);\r\n\r\n    em.persist(parent);\r\n    em.persist(child1);\r\n\r\n    em.flush();\r\n    em.clear();\r\n\r\n    Parent findParent = em.find(Parent.class, parent.getId());\r\n\r\n    findParent.getChildList().remove(0);\r\n    //em.remove(findParent);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nlog\r\n```\r\nHibernate: \r\n    /* insert for\r\n        com.example.jpa.domain.Parent */insert \r\n    into\r\n        parent (name) \r\n    values\r\n        (?)\r\nHibernate: \r\n    /* insert for\r\n        com.example.jpa.domain.Child */insert \r\n    into\r\n        child (name,parent_id) \r\n    values\r\n        (?,?)\r\nHibernate: \r\n    select\r\n        p1_0.member_id,\r\n        p1_0.name \r\n    from\r\n        parent p1_0 \r\n    where\r\n        p1_0.member_id=?\r\nHibernate: \r\n    select\r\n        c1_0.parent_id,\r\n        c1_0.member_id,\r\n        c1_0.name \r\n    from\r\n        child c1_0 \r\n    where\r\n        c1_0.parent_id=?\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am currently a student studying JPA.
