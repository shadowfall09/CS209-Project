Images can be selected from compatible <code>ACTION_GET_CONTENT</code> providers. When selecting images from the Google Photos provider, it works fine when selecting up to 73 images. When selecting 74+ images, it immediately (no image downloads are attempted) returns to my app and the Activity result code is <code>Activity.RESULT_CANCELLED</code>.</p>\n<p>Code to open the image chooser:</p>\n<pre><code>...\n    someActivityResultLauncher = registerForActivityResult(\n                new ActivityResultContracts.StartActivityForResult(),\n                new ChooserActivityResult(this,\n                        this.getBaseContext()));\n...    \n    /**\n     * Open image chooser.\n     */\n    public void openImageChooser() {\n        Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT);\n        intent.setType(&quot;image/*&quot;);\n        intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_ALLOW_MULTIPLE, true);\n        someActivityResultLauncher.launch(Intent.createChooser(intent, getString(R.string.intent_chooser_select_images)));\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>ChooserActivityResult</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>    @Override\n    public void onActivityResult(ActivityResult result) {\n\n        HashSet&lt;Uri&gt; sources = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\n        if (result.getResultCode() == Activity.RESULT_OK) {\n            //do stuff with the Uri(s)\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Selecting 74 or more images from Google Photos returns:</strong> <code>ActivityResult{resultCode=RESULT_CANCELED, data=null}</code></p>\n<p>Selecting 73 or fewer images returns successfully (after downloading the necessary images) and I can process the <code>Uri</code> for one item, or <code>ClipData</code>  for multiple items.</p>\n<p>Selecting any number of images from local storage (not Google Photos) returns successfully and I can process the <code>Uri</code> for one item, or <code>ClipData</code>  for multiple items.</p>\n<p>Also of note, my App can process an incoming share intent. Via this method, it is able to receive up to 200 images from a Google Photos-initiated share (Google Photos only allows up to 200 images to be shared at a time).</p>\n<p>Troubleshooting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My app does not throw any exceptions. It recognizes the <code>Activity.RESULT_CANCELLED</code> result code and does nothing (as it should).</li>\n<li>Watching logcat, there are no messages obviously related to Google Photos when it simply ends and returns to my app.</li>\n<li>Device: Google Pixel 6a (tried with both debug and release variants)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I appreciate any pointers. It's possible Google Photos has some silent limit on the number of images that can be returned via the chooser.
