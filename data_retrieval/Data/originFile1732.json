-5, 6]\r\n\r\n        // convert string to byte array\r\n        String newString = str1.substring(1, str1.length()-1);\r\n        String[] stringArray = newString.split(&quot;, &quot;);\r\n        byte[] by_new = new byte[stringArray.length];\r\n        for(int i=0; i&lt;stringArray.length; i++) {\r\n            by_new[i] = (byte) Integer.parseInt(stringArray[i]);\r\n        }\r\n        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(by_new)); // output: [0, 1, -2, 3, -4, -5, 6]\r\n\r\nBut to convert the string to byte array and then convert that byte array to string, below approach can be used:\r\n\r\n    // 2. convert string to byte array and then byte array to string\r\n\r\n        // convert string to byte array\r\n        String str2 = &quot;[0, 1, -2, 3, -4, -5, 6]&quot;;\r\n        byte[] byteStr2 = str2.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\r\n        // Now byteStr2 is [91, 48, 44, 32, 49, 44, 32, 45, 50, 44, 32, 51, 44, 32, 45, 52, 44, 32, 45, 53, 44, 32, 54, 93]\r\n\r\n        // convert byte array to string\r\n        System.out.println(new String(byteStr2, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)); // output: [0, 1, -2, 3, -4, -5, 6]\r\n\r\n\r\nI have also answered the same in the

For that I have created a SQL query in my repository:</p>\n<pre><code>package ch.ak.sweetholiday.sweetholidaybe.repository;\n\nimport ch.ak.sweetholiday.sweetholidaybe.model.SweetholidayUserHouse;\nimport org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;\nimport org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query;\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;\n\nimport java.util.List;\n\n@Repository\npublic interface SweetholidayUserHouseRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;SweetholidayUserHouse, Long&gt; {\n    @Query(value = &quot;SELECT sweetholiday_user_house.start_rent_date, sweetholiday_user_house.end_rent_date FROM sweetholiday_user_house&quot;, nativeQuery = true)\n    List&lt;SweetholidayUserHouse&gt; findAllReserved();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As soon as the method &quot;findAllReserved&quot; gets called, I get the following error message:</p>\n<pre><code>TransactionSafe called.\n2021-12-25 21:44:28.711  WARN 57746 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] o.h.engine.jdbc.spi.SqlExceptionHelper   : SQL Error: 0, SQLState: S0022\n2021-12-25 21:44:28.711 ERROR 57746 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] o.h.engine.jdbc.spi.SqlExceptionHelper   : Column 'id' not found.\n2021-12-25 21:44:28.760 ERROR 57746 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] o.a.c.c.C.[.[.[/].[dispatcherServlet]    : Servlet.service() for servlet [dispatcherServlet] in context with path [] threw exception [Request processing failed; nested exception is org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException: could not execute query; SQL [SELECT sweetholiday_user_house.start_rent_date, sweetholiday_user_house.end_rent_date FROM sweetholiday_user_house]; nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.SQLGrammarException: could not execute query] with root cause\n\njava.sql.SQLException: Column 'id' not found.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I tried it with the JPQL query, but it still doesn't work. I'm writing because I couldn't find a solution for it anywhere. I also don't want to use @JSONIgnore because I need the id and the foreign ids like house_id for another API call. I'm doing this because I don't want to send all information to everyone. Because when I send the foreign ids like user_id, everyone will have access to every user data.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EPd1t.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The class in

I&#39;m trying to build a program to control a breadboard through Arduino using the bluetooth module HC-05. At the moment I don&#39;t have anything on the breadboard and I&#39;m just trying to test the connection. This is what I&#39;ve done so far:\r\n\r\nI put the module on the breadboard and I&#39;ve paired it with the computer. When it&#39;s paired, the red led starts blinking slowly. I&#39;ve connected the bluetooth Rx to Arduino Tx and Arduino Rx to bluetooth Tx following this tutorial: http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/Tutorial01\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also implemented both Java and Arduino programs following that tutorial. Here they are:\r\n\r\nJAVA\r\n\r\n    public class Arduino extends PApplet{\r\n\t\r\n\tpublic void connect(){\r\n\t\tString[] serials = Serial.list();\r\n\t    Serial port = new Serial(this, Serial.list()[0], 9600);\r\n\t\tport.write(&#39;H&#39;);\r\n\t\tport.dispose();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nARDUINO\r\n\r\n     void setup() {\r\n      Serial.begin(9600);\r\n      Serial.println(&quot;Start&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void loop() {\r\n      if(Serial.available()){\r\n       int a = Serial.read();\r\n       Serial.print(a);\r\n     }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe Java part should send the letter H to Arduino and Arduino should detect that and print it on the Serial monitor.

Thanks!","title":"Arduino HC-05 Bluetooth module disconnects when sending data","body":"<p>I'm new to Arduino. I'm trying to build a program to control a breadboard through Arduino using the bluetooth module HC-05. At the moment I don't have anything on the breadboard and I'm just trying to test the connection. This is what I've done so far:</p>\n\n<p>I put the module on the breadboard and I've paired it with the computer. When it's paired, the red led starts blinking slowly. I've connected the bluetooth Rx to Arduino Tx and Arduino Rx to bluetooth Tx following this tutorial: <a href=\"http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/Tutorial01\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/Tutorial01</a></p>\n\n<p>I've also implemented both Java and Arduino programs following that tutorial. Here they are:</p>\n\n<p>JAVA</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Arduino extends PApplet{\n\npublic void connect(){\n    String[] serials = Serial.list();\n    Serial port = new Serial(this, Serial.list()[0], 9600);\n    port.write('H');\n    port.dispose();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>ARDUINO</p>\n\n<pre><code> void setup() {\n  Serial.begin(9600);\n  Serial.println(\"Start\");\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  if(Serial.available()){\n   int a = Serial.read();\n   Serial.print(a);\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The Java part should send the letter H to Arduino and Arduino should detect that and print it on the Serial monitor. But what actually happens is that I send data, and the led on the HC-05 starts blinking faster (which means the connection is lost). Why does that happen? I'm pretty confused. For the communication I'm using the port COM6 and COM7. It depends on how it connects.

Here's what I've got:</p>\n<pre><code>public class Superclass {\n    \n    private int x;\n    \n    protected void setX(int n) {\n        this.x = n;\n        System.out.println(this.x);\n    }\n    \n    protected int getX() {\n        return this.x;\n    }\n}\n\n\npublic class Subclass extends Superclass {  \n    public void begin() {\n        setX(55);   \n        Subclass2 subclass2 = new Subclass2();\n        subclass2.begin();\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Subclass2 extends Superclass {\n    public void begin() {\n        System.out.println(getX());\n    }\n}\n\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Subclass subclass = new Subclass();\n        subclass.begin();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The superclass value successfully sets to 55, but when I call it from Subclass 2 it returns 0.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","selenium"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4397648,"reputation":38,"user_id":3584192,"display_name":"Bhaskar Gundu"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1640487885,"creation_date":1640460537,"answer_id":70482276,"question_id":70482222,"body_markdown":"I just searched for your query in Google to check , with the intention to learn more about what exactly is the question and topic ,\r\nI got this :\r\n\r\n&quot;People also ask&quot;\r\n\r\n(Q)How do you fix stale element reference element is not attached to the page document in selenium?\r\n\r\nSolution : The element in the DOM is not found because your page is not entirely loaded when Selenium is searching for the element.

That memory is physically a few centimeters away. Let&#39;s say 15 centimeters.\r\n\r\nThe speed of light is 300,000 kilometers per second, give or take. That&#39;s 30,000,000,000,000 centimeters every second. The speed of light in medium is not as fast as in vacuum, but it&#39;s close so lets ignore that part. That means sending a single signal from the CPU to the memory, even if the CPU and memory both can _instantly_ process it all, is already limiting you to 1,000,000,000 or 1Ghz (You need to cover 30 centimeters to get form the core to the memory and back, so you can do that 1,000,000,000 every second. If you can do it any faster, you&#39;re travelling backwards in time. Or some such. You get a nobel prize if you figure out how to manage that one).\r\n\r\nProcessors are about that fast! We measure core speeds in Ghz these days, as in, in the time it takes __the signal to travel__, the CPU&#39;s clock has already ticked. In practice of course that memory controller is not instantaneous either, nor is the CPU pipelining system.\r\n\r\nThus:\r\n\r\n&gt; It has always been my understanding that in modern CPUs, cache memory implements coherency protocols that guarantee that reads/writes are seen equally by all processors, cores, hardware threads, etc, at all levels of the cache architecture. Am I wrong?\r\n\r\nYes, you are wrong. QED.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know why you think that or where you read that. You misremember, or you misunderstood what was written, or whatever was written was very very wrong.\r\n\r\nIn actual fact, an actual update to &#39;main memory&#39; takes on the order of __a thousand__ cycles! A CPU is just sitting there, twiddling its thumbs, doing nothing, in a time window where it could roll through a thousand, on some cores, multiple thousands of instructions, memory is that slow. Molasses level slow.\r\n\r\nThe fix is not registers, you are missing about 20 years of CPU improvement. There aren&#39;t 2 layers (registers, then main memory), no. There are more like 5: Registers, on-die cache in multiple hierarchical levels, and then, eventually, main memory. To make it all very very fast these things are very very close to the core. So close, in fact, that each core has their own, and, __drumroll here__ - modern CPUs __cannot__ read main memory. At all. They are entirely incapable of it.\r\n\r\nInstead what happens is that the CPU sees you write or read to main memory and translates that, as it can&#39;t actually do any of that, by figuring out which &#39;page&#39; of memory that is trying to read/write to (each chunk of e.g. 64k worth of memory is a page; actual page size depends on hardware). The CPU then checks if any of the pages loaded in its on-die cache is that page. If yes, great, and it&#39;s all mapped to that. Which does mean that, if 2 cores both have that page loaded, they both have __their own copy__, and obviously anything that one core does to its copy is entirely invisible to the other core.\r\n\r\nIf the CPU does -not- find this page in its own on-die cache you get what&#39;s called a cache miss, and the CPU will then check which of its loaded pages is least used, and will purge this page. Purging is &#39;free&#39; if the CPU hasn&#39;t modified it, but if that page is &#39;dirty&#39;, it will first send a ping to the memory controller followed by blasting the entire sequence of 64k bytes into it (because sending a burst is way, way faster than waiting for the signal to bounce back and forth or to try to figure out which part of that 64k block is dirty), and the memory controller will take care of it. Then, that same CPU pings the controller to blast the correct page to it and overwrites the space that was just purged out. Now the CPU &#39;retries&#39; the instruction, and this time it does work, as that page IS now in &#39;memory&#39;, in the sense that the part of the CPU that translates the memory location to cachepage+offset now no longer throws a CacheMiss.\r\n\r\nAnd whilst all of that is going on, THOUSANDS of cycles can pass, because it&#39;s all very very slow. Cache misses suck.\r\n\r\nThis explains many things:\r\n\r\n* It explains why volatile is slow and synchronized is slower. Dog slow. In general if you want big speed, you want processes that run [A] independent (do not need to share memory between cores, except at the very start and very end perhaps to load in the data needed to operate on, and to send out the result of the complex operation), and [B] fit all memory needs to perform the calculation in 64k or so, depending on CPU cache sizes and how many pages of L1 cache it has.\r\n\r\n* It explains why one thread can observe a field having value A and another thread observes the same field having a different value for __DAYS__ on end if you&#39;re unlucky. If the cores aren&#39;t doing all that much and the threads checking the values of those fields does it often enough, that page is never purged, and the 2 cores go on their merry way with their local core value for days. A CPU doesn&#39;t sync pages for funsies. It only does this if that page is the &#39;loser&#39; and gets purged.\r\n\r\n* It explains why [Spectre](https://meltdownattack.com) happened.\r\n\r\n* It explains why LinkedList is slower than ArrayList even in cases where basic fundamental informatics says it should be faster (big-O notation, analysing computational complexity). Because as long as the arraylist&#39;s stuff is limited to a single page you can more or less consider it all virtually instant - it takes about the same order of magnitude to fly through an entire page of on-die cache as it takes for that same CPU to wait around for a single cache miss. And LinkedList is horrible on this front: Every `.add` on it creates a tracker object (the linkedlist has to store the &#39;next&#39; and &#39;prev&#39; pointers somewhere!) so for every item in the linked list you have to read 2 objects (the tracker and the actual object), instead of just the one (as the arraylist&#39;s array is in contiguous memory, that page is worst-case scenario read into on-die once and remains active for your entire loop), and it&#39;s very easy to end up with the tracker object and the actual object being on different pages.\r\n\r\n* It explains the Java Memory Model rules: Any line of code may __or may not__ observe the effect of any other line of code on the value of any field. Unless you have established a happens-before/happens-after relationship using any of the many rules set out in the JMM to establish these. That&#39;s to give the JVM the freedom to, you know, not run literally 1000x slower than neccessary, because guaranteeing consistent reads/writes can only be done by flushing memory on every read, and that is 1000x slower than not doing that.\r\n\r\nNB: I have massively oversimplified things. I do not have the skill to fully explain ~20 years of CPU improvements in a mere SO answer. However, it should explain a few things, and it is a marvellous thing to keep in mind as you try to analyse what happens when multiple java threads try to write/read to the same field and you haven&#39;t gone out of your way to make very very sure you have an HB/HA relationship between the relevant lines. If you&#39;re scared now, good. You shouldn&#39;t be attempting to communicate between 2 threads often, or even via fields, unless you really, really know what you are doing. Toss it through a message bus, use designs where the data flow is bounded to the start and end of the entire thread&#39;s process (make a job, initialize the job with the right data, toss it in an ExecutorPool queue, set up that you get notified when its done, read out the result, don&#39;t ever share anything whatsoever with the actual thread that runs it), or talk to each other via the database.\r\n","title":"Java volatile and cache coherency.

You can solve this chicked-egg problem by using a container instead of the value: here I used CompletableFuture as a container:</p>\n<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {\n    final CompletableFuture&lt;ScheduledFuture&lt;?&gt;&gt; cancellablePeriodicTask = new CompletableFuture&lt;&gt;();\n    final ScheduledFuture&lt;?&gt; cancellable = scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(() -&gt; {\n        performHttpCallAndScheduleAgainIfNeeded(cancellablePeriodicTask);\n    }, 1, 60, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\n    cancellablePeriodicTask.complete(cancellable);\n}\n\nprivate static void performHttpCallAndScheduleAgainIfNeeded(CompletableFuture&lt;ScheduledFuture&lt;?&gt;&gt; cancellable) {\n    boolean callWasOk = performHttpCall();\n    if (callWasOk) {\n        // here you cancel\n        cancellable.whenComplete((scheduledFuture, throwable) -&gt; {\n          if (throwable == null) {  \n              scheduledFuture.cancel(true);\n          }\n        });\n    }\n\n    // call was not ok here, nothing to do since the scheduler will call this again.\n}\n\nprivate static boolean performHttpCall() {\n    // do whatever you need to do here...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this approach CompletableFuture as mechanism for passing values between threads is not the only thing that works (SynchronousQueue also works here).</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":17840072,"reputation":107,"user_id":12958132,"display_name":"woxihuanxiayua"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1888,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":70322961,"answer_count":2,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1640461924,"creation_date":1638666133,"question_id":70230742,"body_markdown":"I have a timed task that will make an http call and then check the return result.
