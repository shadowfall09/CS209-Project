So using <code>BroadcastReceiver</code> is better</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":23190867,"reputation":51,"user_id":17287267,"display_name":"Abdullqadir"},"score":0,"creation_date":1687261032,"post_id":76461493,"comment_id":134908900,"body_markdown":"I have tested this on Android 10 and 13, works fine.","body":"I have tested this on Android 10 and 13, works fine."}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":231436,"reputation":2174,"user_id":495673,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"argenkiwi"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1686626394,"creation_date":1686626394,"answer_id":76461493,"question_id":36325088,"body_markdown":"Here is an extension property that produces a flow from a Broadcast receiver:\r\n```\r\nval Context.locationEnabledFlow\r\n    get() = callbackFlow {\r\n        val receiver = object : BroadcastReceiver() {\r\n            override fun onReceive(context: Context?, intent: Intent?) {\r\n                trySend(LocationManagerCompat.isLocationEnabled(locationManager))\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        registerReceiver(receiver, IntentFilter(LocationManager.PROVIDERS_CHANGED_ACTION))\r\n        awaitClose { unregisterReceiver(receiver) }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nFor example, this is how you could use it with Jetpack Compose:\r\n```\r\nval isLocationEnabled by LocalContext.current.locationEnabledFlow\r\n    .collectAsStateWithLifecycle(initialValue = false)\r\n\r\nText(text = when(isLocationEnabled){\r\n    true -&gt; &quot;Location enabled.&quot;\r\n    false -&gt; &quot;Location disabled.&quot;\r\n})\r\n```","title":"How to?

In the way created it is awkward to construct the `Person` - I had to create a little helper method as there is no constructor in your class:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\nprivate static Person makePerson(String id, String type, int age) {\r\n    Person p = new Person();\r\n    p.setPersonID(id);\r\n    p.setType(type);\r\n    p.setAge(age);\r\n    return p;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas, if you make a few small alterations and use a `data class` then this implicitly gives you a constructor, `toString()`, `hashCode()`:\r\n```lang-kotlin\r\n@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)\r\ndata class Person (     //&lt;&lt; round brackets\r\n\r\n    @JsonProperty(&quot;_id&quot;)\r\n    var personID: String? = null,  //&lt;&lt; comma\r\n\r\n    @JsonProperty(&quot;name&quot;)\r\n    var type: String? = null,\r\n\r\n    @JsonProperty(&quot;age&quot;)\r\n    var age: Int? = null,\r\n\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Codec setup\r\n I don&#39;t think you have your Codecs setup in the right way.

A Cursor can be considered as a file and uses 1 of the limited available file allocations (about 1000 or so) for the operating system.\r\n\r\nWith regards to retrieving data from a Cursor, then rather than a moveToFirst and the do until moveToNext returns 0. You can simplify the code using `while(cursor.moveToNext) { .... }`. It is also inadvisable to use hard coded column offsets e.g. `bokmarks.setFileName(cursor.getString(1));` where 1 is the hard coded column offset and relies upon the 2nd column being the file name column and would have to be changed if the order of the columns in the cursor were to change. Instead you can utilise the `Cursor`&#39;s `getColumnIndex` method to get the offset according to the column&#39;s name irrespective of it&#39;s position within the `Cursor`.\r\n\r\nPutting the above together (making some assumptions) then you could have your class that extends SQLiteOpenHelper as (for example) :-\r\n\r\n    class MySQLiteOpenHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper {\r\n    \r\n       public static final String DATABASE_FILENAME = &quot;mydatabase.db&quot;;\r\n       public static final int DATABASE_VERSION = 1;\r\n       public static final String KEY_FILE_NAME = &quot;kfn&quot;;\r\n       public static final String KEY_FILE_URI = &quot;kuri&quot;;\r\n       public static final String KEY_FILE_PATH = &quot;kpath&quot;;\r\n       public static final String KEY_MONTH_NAME = &quot;kmonth&quot;;\r\n       public static final String KEY_DATE = &quot;kdate&quot;;\r\n       public static final String TABLE_DETAIL = &quot;detail&quot;;\r\n    \r\n       @Override\r\n       public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase sqLiteDatabase) {\r\n    \r\n       }\r\n    \r\n       @Override\r\n       public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase sqLiteDatabase, int i, int i1) {\r\n    \r\n       }\r\n    \r\n       private MySQLiteOpenHelper(Context context) {\r\n          super(context,DATABASE_FILENAME,null,DATABASE_VERSION);\r\n       }\r\n    \r\n       private static volatile MySQLiteOpenHelper instance;\r\n       public static MySQLiteOpenHelper getMySQLiteOpenHelperInstance(Context context) {\r\n          if (instance==null) {\r\n             instance = new MySQLiteOpenHelper(context);\r\n          }\r\n          return instance;\r\n       }\r\n    \r\n       public void insertData(List&lt;ModelClass&gt; list) {\r\n          SQLiteDatabase dbase = this.getReadableDatabase();\r\n          dbase.beginTransaction();\r\n          try {\r\n             ContentValues values = new ContentValues();\r\n             for (ModelClass bokmark : list) {\r\n                values.put(KEY_FILE_NAME, bokmark.getFileName());\r\n                values.put(KEY_FILE_URI, String.valueOf(bokmark.getFileUri()));\r\n                values.put(KEY_FILE_PATH, String.valueOf(bokmark.getFilePath()));\r\n                values.put(KEY_MONTH_NAME, bokmark.getMonthName());\r\n                values.put(KEY_DATE, bokmark.getAudioDate());\r\n    \r\n                dbase.insert(TABLE_DETAIL, null, values);\r\n             }\r\n             dbase.setTransactionSuccessful();\r\n          } finally {\r\n             dbase.endTransaction();\r\n          }\r\n          //dbase.close(); /* &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; inefficient database will be closed when App is stopped as part of App cleanup */\r\n       }\r\n    \r\n       public ArrayList&lt;ModelClass&gt; getAllData() {\r\n          ArrayList&lt;ModelClass&gt; bookmarkList = new ArrayList&lt;ModelClass&gt;();\r\n          String selectQuery = &quot;SELECT * FROM &quot; + TABLE_DETAIL;\r\n          //Log.e(&quot;selectQuery===&gt;&quot;, &quot;&quot; + selectQuery);\r\n          SQLiteDatabase dbase = this.getReadableDatabase();\r\n          Cursor cursor = dbase.rawQuery(selectQuery, null);\r\n    \r\n          // looping through all rows and adding to list\r\n          /* &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; get the column offsfets according to the column name rather than hard coding the offsets &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; */\r\n          int fnidx = cursor.getColumnIndex(KEY_FILE_NAME);\r\n          int uriidx = cursor.getColumnIndex(KEY_FILE_URI);\r\n          int fpidx = cursor.getColumnIndex(KEY_FILE_PATH);\r\n          int mnidx = cursor.getColumnIndex(KEY_MONTH_NAME);\r\n          int didx = cursor.getColumnIndex(KEY_DATE);\r\n          while (cursor.moveToNext()) { /*&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Simpler while loop */\r\n             ModelClass bokmarks = new ModelClass();\r\n             bokmarks.setFileName(cursor.getString(fnidx));\r\n             bokmarks.setFileUri(parse(cursor.getString(uriidx)));\r\n             bokmarks.setFilePath(cursor.getString(fpidx));\r\n             bokmarks.setMonthName(cursor.getString(mnidx));\r\n             bokmarks.setAudioDate(cursor.getString(didx));\r\n             bookmarkList.add(bokmarks);\r\n          }\r\n          cursor.close();\r\n          //dbase.close(); /* &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; inefficient database will be closed when App is stopped as part of App cleanup */\r\n          return bookmarkList;\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n- ***Note** the above code is in-principle code, it has not been compiled and run so may contain some errors*\r\n\r\nAs for running in separate threads, there are many ways.

Then, each node points to up to 26 descendants, one for each letter than can follow the prefix from the root to the current node.\r\n\r\nExample: we want to store CAT, CAN, COT, ART, ARE\r\n\r\n               root\r\n              /    \\\r\n             C      A\r\n            / \\     |\r\n           A   O    R\r\n          / \\  |   / \\\r\n         N   T T  E   T\r\n\r\nPut the list of words in a prefix tree. If a word is ever an extension of another word (e.g. catatonic vs cat), omit the longer word. I.e., in creating your tree, if a word ever ends on a letter with descendants, delete all descendants from the tree. If a word ever extends past a leaf, ignore it.\r\n\r\nThis step is O(sum of letter counts of forbidden words)\r\n\r\n**Step 2: find the starting and ending indices of banned words in the input string**\r\n\r\nMaintain a linked list of references/pointers to letters in the prefix tree, initially empty. I&#39;ll call these pointers below.\r\n\r\nFirst, an example: Say the input string is CART, and the banned words are CAN, CAT, COT, ARE, ART as above.\r\n\r\n    parse C: create a new pointer to the &#39;C&#39; child of the root\r\n    parse A: create a new pointer to the &#39;A&#39; child of the root\r\n             update the &#39;C&#39; pointer to point to its child &#39;A&#39;\r\n    parse R: we don&#39;t create a new pointer since no banned word starts with &#39;R&#39;\r\n             delete the pointer to the &#39;A&#39; that has no &#39;R&#39; child\r\n             update the pointer to the other &#39;A&#39; to point to its R child\r\n    parse T: we don&#39;t create a new pointer since no banned word starts with &#39;R&#39;\r\n             update the only remaining pointer to point to its &#39;T&#39; child. Notice that this is a leaf 3 down from the root, so the end of a length 3 banned word. Store the pair of indices for later use.\r\n\r\nNote that every single pointer will always point to the current letter. On every step, a pointer either:\r\n 1. moves to its child that matches the new letter\r\n 2. is deleted if no child matches the new letter\r\n 3. is created if the root has a child matching the new letter (i.e. if a banned word starts with the new letter)\r\n\r\nParse the input string.

The character count is the depth in the prefix tree. Note the index where each word starts and ends.\r\n\r\nThis step is O((length of input string) * (average number of pointers)).

Is there a way to either:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Save another value based on my &quot;parsedValue&quot; result and save it as long so i can search against it</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If I can't do it during mapping part, what about parsing as part of the query?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So to recap - I want to perform Ranged query on incoming Phone numbers with non-numeric values. I did filter it with custom analyzer to remove non-digits but can't search against it due to the result value still being a string.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","multithreading","midi","interrupted-exception"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2246691,"reputation":26585,"user_id":1979882,"accept_rate":90,"display_name":"Vyacheslav"},"score":0,"creation_date":1473169642,"post_id":39211146,"comment_id":66031005,"body_markdown":"Please, provide more information where  `MyRunnable` is called.

All the bubbles are the same X &amp; Y of 200</p>\n<p>I removed all imports for simplicity of the files.</p>\n<pre><code>public class Bubble {\n    Bitmap bubble[] = new Bitmap[7];\n    int bubbleFrame = 0;\n    int bubbleX, bubbleY, bubbleV;\n    Random random;\n\n    public Bubble(Context context){\n        bubble[0] = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(context.getResources(), R.drawable.bubble0);\n        bubble[1] = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(context.getResources(), R.drawable.bubble1);\n        bubble[2] = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(context.getResources(), R.drawable.bubble2);\n        bubble[3] = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(context.getResources(), R.drawable.bubble_green);\n        bubble[4] = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(context.getResources(), R.drawable.bubble_blue);\n        bubble[5] = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(context.getResources(), R.drawable.bubble_yellow);\n        bubble[6] = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(context.getResources(), R.drawable.bubble_red);\n        random = new Random();\n        resetPosition();\n    }\n\n    public Bitmap getBubble(int bubbleFrame){\n        return bubble[bubbleFrame];\n    }\n\n    public int getBubbleWidth(){\n        return bubble[0].getWidth();\n    }\n\n    public int getBubbleHeight(){\n        return bubble[0].getHeight();\n    }\n\n    public void resetPosition() {\n        bubbleX = random.nextInt(GameView.dWidth - getBubbleWidth());\n        bubbleY = -200 + random.nextInt(600) * -1;\n        bubbleV = 35 + random.nextInt(16);\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is my Gameview file as well.</p>\n<pre><code>public class GameView extends View {\n\n    Bitmap background, ground, player;\n    Rect rectBackground, rectGround;\n    Context context;\n    Handler handler;\n    final long UPDATE_MILLIS = 30;\n    Runnable runnable;\n    Paint textPaint = new Paint();\n    Paint healthPaint = new Paint();\n    float TEXT_SIZE = 120;\n    int points = 0;\n    int life = 30;\n    static int dWidth, dHeight;\n    Random random;\n    float playerX, playerY;\n    float oldX;\n    float oldPlayerX;\n    ArrayList&lt;Bubble&gt;
