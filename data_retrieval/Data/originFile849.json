If you want your method to be able to dynamically return the type you want, then you can use `Array.newInstance()`.

Tearing apart the `work-runtime-2.7.0.aar` to check for its `inspector.jar` gave a trace to the `androidx.work.inspection` package, however the [Android sources][6] didn&#39;t help much because of a lack of comments. But one can assume that `inspector.jar` also is used for code inspection.\r\n\r\n**The Verdict**\r\n\r\nThe file `lint.jar` is used to customize the Lint rules, and therefore the code inspection process, for the specific AAR file it is included into. It is probably primarily used by the AAR developers themselves, but maybe is also provided to the users in case one wants to customize the AAR, at least its `res` directory. The file `inspector.jar` highly likely serves a similar purpose.\r\n\r\nNeither `lint.jar` nor `inspector.jar` will be included into the APK.

And then I exit, as you can see it in the last line.</p>\n\n<p>But sometimes this is what I get:</p>\n\n<pre><code>keyPressed 17\nList of pressed inputs\nctrl\nkeyPressed 79\nList of pressed inputs\nctrl\no\nkeyReleased 17\n2014.10.09, 10:57:34  [INFORMATION]  Open a project ...\n2014.10.09, 10:57:34  [INFORMATION]  Opening file chooser for load.\n2014.10.09, 10:57:35  [INFORMATION]  User clicked 'cancel' in file chooser dialog.\nkeyPressed 17\nList of pressed inputs\nctrl\nkeyReleased 79\n2014.10.09, 10:57:36  [INFORMATION]  Open a project ...\n2014.10.09, 10:57:36  [INFORMATION]  Opening file chooser for load.\n2014.10.09, 10:57:38  [INFORMATION]  User clicked 'cancel' in file chooser dialog.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I get the ctrl and o keyPressed, but I miss one of the keyReleased, the o in this case. Anyway the fileChooser still gets opened. In the next attempt I press again ctrl+o but this time I miss the o keyPressed. I also miss the ctrl keyReleased. Anyway the fileChooser gets still opened.\nBut sometimes it doesnt open, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>keyPressed 17\nList of pressed inputs\nctrl\nkeyPressed 79\nList of pressed inputs\nctrl\no\nkeyReleased 17\n2014.10.09, 11:08:57  [INFORMATION]  Open a project ...\n2014.10.09, 11:08:57  [INFORMATION]  Opening file chooser for load.\n2014.10.09, 11:08:58  [INFORMATION]  User clicked 'cancel' in file chooser dialog.\nkeyPressed 17\nList of pressed inputs\nctrl\nkeyReleased 79\n2014.10.09, 11:08:59  [INFORMATION]  Open a project ...\n2014.10.09, 11:08:59  [INFORMATION]  Opening file chooser for load.\n2014.10.09, 11:09:02  [INFORMATION]  User clicked 'cancel' in file chooser dialog.\nkeyReleased 79\nkeyReleased 17\nkeyReleased 79\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I get ctrl-keyPressed, o-keyPressed, ctrl-keyReleased, no o-keyReleased, fileChooser opens, then I close it.\nI pressed them again, I get ctrl-keyPressed, no o-keyPressed, o-keyReleased, no ctrl-keyReleased, fileChooser opens, then I close it again.\nI press ctrl+o again, I do not get any keyPressed, I just get an o-keyReleased, a ctrl-keyReleased and then another o-keyReleased. FileChooser does not open this time..</p>\n\n<p>Any clue?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","java","html","local-storage","materialize"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":22581546,"reputation":465,"user_id":16766120,"display_name":"m-naeem66622"},"score":0,"creation_date":1667420332,"post_id":74295018,"comment_id":131165852,"body_markdown":"i had understand what you want to ask....","body":"i had understand what you want to ask...."}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":26780189,"reputation":374,"user_id":20375146,"display_name":"Facundo Gallardo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1669685058,"creation_date":1667421064,"answer_id":74295323,"question_id":74295018,"body_markdown":"You need to store the favourite cards somewhere, ideally I would say use a Database, but if your project does not have a database yet, the easiest way to do it is to use local storage:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll definitely need to add some javascript in your site.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll let you some links here, and an example:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage#value\r\n\r\n## Example ##\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function onAddButtonClick() {\r\n      // This function will get excecuted whne you click the Add button\r\n      localStorage.setItem(&#39;favouriteCard&#39;, &#39;MockText&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function onFavouriteViewLoad() {\r\n      // You can get this function excecuted when you load the favourite.html page\r\n      // to get what you want to show.\r\n      return localStorage.getItem(&#39;favouriteCard&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;head prefix=&quot;og: http://ogp.me/ns#&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;title&gt;Example&lt;/title&gt;\r\n        &lt;base href=&quot;/&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; type=&quot;image/x-icon&quot; href=&quot;favicon.ico&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;col s12 m6&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;card-image&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;img src=&quot;images/sample-1.jpg&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;span class=&quot;card-title&quot;&gt;Card Title&lt;/span&gt;\r\n            &lt;button onClick=&quot;onAddButtonClick()&quot; class=&quot;btn-floating halfway-fab waves-effect waves-light red&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;add&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;card-content&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;p&gt;I am a very simple card.

Another one is <code>project-types</code> module where I store gradle plugins to overcome configuration duplication. <code>content</code> project just have one subproject called <code>model</code> and <code>game</code> project has three: <code>api</code>, <code>impl</code>, and also 'model`.</p>\n<p><code>lib-&gt;game-&gt;model</code> project depends on <code>lib-&gt;content-&gt;model</code>\n<code>lib-&gt;game-&gt;impl</code> project depends in <code>lib-&gt;game-&gt;api</code></p>\n<p>So another really strange thing is that <code>lib-&gt;game-&gt;impl</code> WORKD just fine and compiles even when he is dependent on <code>lib-&gt;game-&gt;api</code>. But the same thing doesn't work for 'lib-&gt;game-&gt;model' which uses THE SAME mechanism to depend on 'lib-&gt;content-&gt;model'</p>\n<p>So I'm lost and don't know what to do. There is a good reason I need all of them to be different projects but I don't want to put myself through the hell of publishing new artifact to local repo every time I change code in one of them. Can someone please help me fix it T-T</p>\n<p>My <code>./gradlew -q projects</code> output:</p>\n<pre><code>------------------------------------------------------------\nRoot project 'test'\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRoot project 'test'\n\\--- Project ':lib'\n     +--- Project ':lib:content'\n     |    \\--- Project ':lib:content:model'\n     \\--- Project ':lib:game'\n          +--- Project ':lib:game:api'\n          +--- Project ':lib:game:impl'\n          \\--- Project ':lib:game:model'\n\nIncluded builds\n\\--- Included build ':project-types'\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>project-types</code> contains <code>common</code> and <code>kotlin-project</code> sub projects.</p>\n<p><code>common</code> build.gradle:</p>\n<pre><code>plugins {\n    id 'groovy-gradle-plugin'\n}\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>and <code>commons.gradle</code> file inside src:</p>\n<pre><code>plugins {\n    id 'java'\n}\n\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n    mavenLocal()\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core:2.13.4'\n    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-annotations:2.13.4'\n    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.13.4'\n    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype:jackson-datatype-jsr310:2.13.4'\n    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-paranamer:2.13.4'\n\n    implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.36'\n    implementation 'ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.2.11'\n\n    implementation 'commons-io:commons-io:2.11.0'\n    implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.12.0'\n    implementation 'commons-codec:commons-codec:1.15'\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>kotlin-project</code> build.gradle file:</p>\n<pre><code>dependencyResolutionManagement {\n    repositories {\n        mavenLocal()\n        mavenCentral()\n        gradlePluginPortal()\n        google()\n    }\n}\n\nrootProject.name = 'project-types'\n\ninclude 'commons'\ninclude 'kotlin-project'\n</code></pre>\n<p>and it's <code>kotlin-project.gradle</code> file inside src:</p>\n<pre><code>plugins {\n    id 'commons'\n    id 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm'\n    id 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.kapt'\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8'\n    implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-reflect'\n    implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-jdk8:1.6.4'\n\n    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-kotlin'\n\n    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.9.1'\n    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-params:5.9.1'\n    testImplementation 'org.mockito:mockito-junit-jupiter:4.8.1'\n    testImplementation 'org.mockito.kotlin:mockito-kotlin:4.0.0'\n    testRuntimeOnly 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.9.1'\n\n}\n\ntest {\n    useJUnitPlatform()\n}\n\ncompileKotlin {\n    kotlinOptions.jvmTarget = '17'\n    kotlinOptions.freeCompilerArgs = ['-Xjsr305=strict', '-Xemit-jvm-type-annotations']\n}\n\ncompileTestKotlin {\n    kotlinOptions.jvmTarget = '17'\n    kotlinOptions.freeCompilerArgs = ['-Xjsr305=strict', '-Xemit-jvm-type-annotations']\n}\n\nkapt {\n    correctErrorTypes = true\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So my main projects structure is:</p>\n<p>My <code>./setting.gradle</code> file content:</p>\n<pre><code>rootProject.name = 'test'\n\nincludeBuild 'project-types'\n\ninclude 'lib:game'\ninclude 'lib:game:model'\ninclude 'lib:game:api'\ninclude 'lib:game:impl'\n\ninclude 'lib:content'\ninclude 'lib:content:model'\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>./build.gradle</code> file content</p>\n<pre><code>plugins {\n    id 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm' version &quot;1.7.21&quot;

(It looks a bit like it might be a mis-translation from a non-antler grammar, but I&#39;d just be guessing)\r\n\r\nFirst, a couple of things to watch out for:\r\n\r\n- empty rule alternatives:\r\n```\r\nrest returns [String node]: &#39;*&#39; t=term r=rest           {$node = $t.node + &quot; &quot; + $r.node + &quot;*&quot; ;}\r\n                          | &#39;/&#39; t=term r=rest           {$node = $t.node + &quot; &quot; + $r.node + &quot;/&quot; ;}\r\n                          | &#39;+&#39; t=term r=rest           {$node = $t.node + &quot;+&quot;  + $r.node ;}\r\n                          | &#39;-&#39; t=term r=rest           {$node = $t.node + &quot;-&quot; + $r.node   ;}\r\n                          |                              {$node = &quot; &quot;;};  // \r\n```\r\nThe last alternative is empty and will match &quot;nothing&quot;.
