What it does is require that the semantics of the operation be safe, and therefore it is a fault of the implementation, not the interface or the user of that interface, if anything happens as a result that causes loss of property....\r\n\r\nIf we can apply that idea in general, then a PATCH request _means_ &quot;please apply these changes atomically&quot;, but the server does have the freedom to do something other than what was asked.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of the server, these are our resources, and we get to decide when and how to change them.  So we could reject the proposed patch, and also make changes of our own choosing, which _could_ be a subset of the changes that were proposed in the request.\r\n\r\nBut if we do that, and it &quot;makes a mess&quot;, that&#39;s on us (the implementation) and not on HTTP or on the client sending the messages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789#section-2\r\n  [2]: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Apr/0207.html","title":"Should REST patch accept multiple entities in a single request body or different requests per entity","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>For Patch, should we a keep single endpoint which could accept request body like given below where SPA can send either one of the entities be updated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That depends on: what are you using for <code>GET</code>?

On the other hand, if the main document was linking to other documents, then you would patch the main document to change the links, and patch the link target to change the representations returned from there.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>Does this mean the patch operation - /api/organization, should be executed atomically on the server (for ex. as a transaction on a DB) and if students node in the request has bad data, teachers should not be saved/rolled back?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you want a simple answer that elides the concerns of nuance: yes.</p>\n<p>The more complicated version considers this observation by <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2002Apr/0207.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Roy Fielding</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>HTTP does not attempt to require the results of a GET to be safe.  What it does is require that the semantics of the operation be safe, and therefore it is a fault of the implementation, not the interface or the user of that interface, if anything happens as a result that causes loss of property....</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we can apply that idea in general, then a PATCH request <em>means</em> &quot;please apply these changes atomically&quot;, but the server does have the freedom to do something other than what was asked.</p>\n<p>From the perspective of the server, these are our resources, and we get to decide when and how to change them.  So we could reject the proposed patch, and also make changes of our own choosing, which <em>could</em> be a subset of the changes that were proposed in the request.</p>\n<p>But if we do that, and it &quot;makes a mess&quot;, that's on us (the implementation) and not on HTTP or on the client sending the messages.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":4119598,"reputation":383,"user_id":3380336,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"Ketan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":541,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":75829622,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1679802569,"creation_date":1679620577,"question_id":75829264,"body_markdown":"I have a question around choosing an approach while designing our REST API. \r\n\r\nOur REST API will be consumed by a SPA app (Created in React in case relevant) to add/update an Organization model which looks like following -\r\n\r\n```\r\nClass Organization{\r\n    List&lt;Student&gt; students;\r\n    List&lt;Teacher&gt; teachers;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe plan to provide Post and Patch methods for interactions with our API.\r\n\r\nFor Patch, should we a keep single endpoint which could accept request body like given below where SPA can send either one of the entities be updated.\r\n\r\nApproach 1 -\r\n\r\nPatch\r\n\r\n```\r\n/api/organization\r\n{\r\n    &quot;students&quot;:[],\r\n    &quot;teachers&quot;:[]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr should we instead provide two separate endpoints to update the specific entity?\r\n\r\nApproach 2 -\r\n\r\n```\r\n/api/organization/students/{id}\r\n\r\n/api/organization/teachers/{id}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Please note that in real scenario there are around 10 such entities)\r\n\r\nSPA team is in favor of approach 1 keeping single endpoint which gives them flexibility to send any entity to a single patch endpoint and not having to keep track of different endpoints per entity.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, API team is in favor approach 2 of patch endpoint per entity so they can have events generated on the back-end based on the patch call they receive per entity and not having to go through request body to see what came in.\r\n\r\nIs there any REST standard which applies in above scenario to choose one approach over the other?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"Should REST patch accept multiple entities in a single request body or different requests per entity","body":"<p>I have a question around choosing an approach while designing our REST API.</p>\n<p>Our REST API will be consumed by a SPA app (Created in React in case relevant) to add/update an Organization model which looks like following -</p>\n<pre><code>Class Organization{\n    List&lt;Student&gt; students;\n    List&lt;Teacher&gt; teachers;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We plan to provide Post and Patch methods for interactions with our API.</p>\n<p>For Patch, should we a keep single endpoint which could accept request body like given below where SPA can send either one of the entities be updated.</p>\n<p>Approach 1 -</p>\n<p>Patch</p>\n<pre><code>/api/organization\n{\n    &quot;students&quot;:[],\n    &quot;teachers&quot;:[]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or should we instead provide two separate endpoints to update the specific entity?</p>\n<p>Approach 2 -</p>\n<pre><code>/api/organization/students/{id}\n\n/api/organization/teachers/{id}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>(Please note that in real scenario there are around 10 such entities)</p>\n<p>SPA team is in favor of approach 1 keeping single endpoint which gives them flexibility to send any entity to a single patch endpoint and not having to keep track of different endpoints per entity.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, API team is in favor approach 2 of patch endpoint per entity so they can have events generated on the back-end based on the patch call they receive per entity and not having to go through request body to see what came in.</p>\n<p>Is there any REST standard which applies in above scenario to choose one approach over the other?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","mapbox"],"owner":{"account_id":1311937,"reputation":1459,"user_id":1259763,"accept_rate":73,"display_name":"Federico Alvarez"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":151,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1679802003,"creation_date":1679798496,"question_id":75845601,"body_markdown":"I have been working with maps on android as a developer for quite a while, now  I have to intgrate MapBox to an exisitng app that is only Java, no Kotlin, and I find absolutely no way to add a marker to a Mapbox map!\r\n\r\nTo be honest this is ridiculous, it should not take more than a couple of minutes.

This is of course a bit of a hack since a terminal that supports the DSR code might not support color for example.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":4425106,"reputation":198,"user_id":3603786,"display_name":"Slye"},"score":1,"creation_date":1537193591,"post_id":52365927,"comment_id":91683912,"body_markdown":"I tested it and as you have said, doesn&#39;t work on Windows, but is useful for Unix systems.\nSince it has been 2 years, i will mark this as an answer.","body":"I tested it and as you have said, doesn&#39;t work on Windows, but is useful for Unix systems.
