The second of these two solutions seems like a good option, except when moving your finger very fast you will have long sections of a straight line then sharp curves.</p>\n\n<p>If there are any other solutions it would be great to hear them.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any help in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","netbeans","client","jax-ws"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":18868,"reputation":82004,"user_id":43681,"accept_rate":70,"display_name":"sleske"},"score":0,"creation_date":1365544717,"post_id":4163586,"comment_id":22665349,"body_markdown":"Similar question: [JAX-WS Loading WSDL from jar](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/764772/jax-ws-loading-wsdl-from-jar/15913322#15913322)","body":"Similar question: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/764772/jax-ws-loading-wsdl-from-jar/15913322#15913322\">JAX-WS Loading WSDL from jar</a>"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"display_name":"user260192"},"score":0,"creation_date":1289994723,"post_id":4178783,"comment_id":4545530,"body_markdown":"ok, i&#39;m not been able to solve the problem this way within the web application : i&#39;ve tried to put wsdl inside web-inf without success, probably for my lack of knowledge.

OnTouchListener\r\n2. OnFocusChangeListener\r\n3. OnClickListener \r\n\r\nThe first time the user touches an EditText it receives focus so that the user can type. *The action is consumed here.*  Therefor the lower priority OnClickListener is not called.

Notice that the listener returns `false`, this allows the event to trickle down to the built-in OnFocusChangeListener which changes the focus so the user can type in the EditText. \r\n\r\n2. Implement an OnFocusChangeListener along with the OnClickListener:\r\n\r\n        ed1.setOnFocusChangeListener(new OnFocusChangeListener() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void onFocusChange(View v, boolean hasFocus) {\r\n                if(hasFocus)\r\n                    editTextClicked(); // Instead of your Toast\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n    This listener catches the first touch event when the focus is changed while your OnClickListener catches every other event.\r\n\r\n3. (This isn&#39;t a valid answer here, but it is a good trick to know.) Set the focusable attribute to `false` in your XML:\r\n\r\n        android:focusable=&quot;false&quot;\r\n\r\n    Now the OnClickListener will fire _every_ time it is clicked. But this makes the EditText useless since the user can no longer enter any text...\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\n[`getApplicationContext()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#getApplicationContext()) can create memory leaks.

It is needed so that recognition stops only when the user himself stops recording (if the user pauses during speaking, recognition may stop automatically, but I do not need this).</p>\n<pre><code>private SpeechRecognizer speechRecognizer;\nprivate Intent speechRecognizerIntent;\n\nprivate String recognizedMessage = &quot;&quot;;\n\nprivate boolean isStoppedByUser = false;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I initialize the SpeechRecognizer in a separate method that is called from onCreate().</p>\n<pre><code>private void initSpeechRecognizer() {\n    speechRecognizer = SpeechRecognizer.createSpeechRecognizer(this);\n    \n    speechRecognizerIntent = new Intent(RecognizerIntent.ACTION_RECOGNIZE_SPEECH);\n    speechRecognizerIntent.putExtra(RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_LANGUAGE_MODEL, RecognizerIntent.LANGUAGE_MODEL_FREE_FORM); \n    speechRecognizerIntent.putExtra(RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_MAX_RESULTS, 5); \n    speechRecognizerIntent.putExtra(RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_CALLING_PACKAGE, getClass().getPackage().getName()); \n    speechRecognizerIntent.putExtra(RecognizerIntent.EXTRA_LANGUAGE, Locale.getDefault());\n\n    boolean isRecognitionAvailable = SpeechRecognizer.isRecognitionAvailable(this);\n    Toast.makeText(this, &quot;isRecognitionAvailable = &quot; + isRecognitionAvailable, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n    Log.i(TAG, &quot;isRecognitionAvailable: &quot; + isRecognitionAvailable);\n\n    speechRecognizer.setRecognitionListener(new RecognitionListener() {\n        \n        @Override\n        public void onRmsChanged(float rmsdB) {\n            Log.d(TAG, &quot;onRmsChanged() called with: rmsdB = [&quot; + rmsdB + &quot;]&quot;);\n        }\n        \n        @Override\n        public void onResults(Bundle results) {\n            Log.d(TAG, &quot;onResults() called with: results = [&quot; + results + &quot;]&quot;);\n\n            ArrayList&lt;String&gt; data = results.getStringArrayList(SpeechRecognizer.RESULTS_RECOGNITION);\n            recognizedMessage += &quot; &quot; + data.get(0);\n            Log.d(TAG, &quot;onResults(): recognizedMessage = &quot; + recognizedMessage);\n\n            // If recognition stops by itself (as a result of a pause in speaking), we start recognition again\n            if (!isStoppedByUser) {\n                speechRecognizer.startListening(speechRecognizerIntent);\n            }\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void onError(int error) {\n            Log.d(TAG, &quot;onError() called with: error = [&quot; + error + &quot;]&quot;);\n\n            if (!isStoppedByUser) {\n                speechRecognizer.startListening(speechRecognizerIntent);\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Other callback methods.

That is, the sound level changes. Then other callback methods are called, and the string is successfully formed.</p>\n<p>But on Realme, the <code>onRmsChanged()</code> method is called only once, at the very beginning, with a value of <code>-2.0</code>. Nothing else happens while I'm speaking, and when I stop recording, the <code>onError()</code> method is called with code 7 (<code>ERROR_NO_MATCH</code>).</p>\n<p>It's as if the SpeechRecognizer can't hear me, but there are no problems with the microphone, and the <code>RECORD_AUDIO</code> permission is also granted: the audio itself is successfully recorded and can be listened to.</p>\n<p>If I open the Google app and enter a voice request, everything also works fine.</p>\n<p>I will be very grateful if you recommend what other parameters can be set to solve this problem.

I tried moving the JAR file into the directory to run it with the rest of the zip file, but the same error/inability to connect to website API occurred.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":5879019,"reputation":1195,"user_id":4629025,"display_name":"Raushan Kumar"},"score":0,"creation_date":1671879635,"post_id":74905591,"comment_id":132191631,"body_markdown":"are you sure StaffSectionCode and studentSectionCode are getting updated to db, it might be in jpa cache. please use entityManager.clear() then do get the row details.","body":"are you sure StaffSectionCode and studentSectionCode are getting updated to db, it might be in jpa cache. please use entityManager.clear() then do get the row details."},{"owner":{"account_id":26040318,"reputation":21,"user_id":19745248,"display_name":"Mahrukh Saeed"},"score":0,"creation_date":1671889624,"post_id":74905591,"comment_id":132193063,"body_markdown":"Thank you for your response, it&#39;s still getting updated even i used entityManager.clear().","body":"Thank you for your response, it&#39;s still getting updated even i used entityManager.clear()."},{"owner":{"account_id":26040318,"reputation":21,"user_id":19745248,"display_name":"Mahrukh Saeed"},"score":0,"creation_date":1671889801,"post_id":74905591,"comment_id":132193098,"body_markdown":"Is there any way to restrict staffSectionCode and studentSectionCode on controller level, so that in update case use the same classid which is basically a guid.","body":"Is there any way to restrict staffSectionCode and studentSectionCode on controller level, so that in update case use the same classid which is basically a guid."},{"owner":{"account_id":5879019,"reputation":1195,"user_id":4629025,"display_name":"Raushan Kumar"},"score":0,"creation_date":1671890332,"post_id":74905591,"comment_id":132193195,"body_markdown":"just try to print the query or use jpa logger that will show which query is getting fired. as per doc if annotation is at field level that it should not part of the update statement.","body":"just try to print the query or use jpa logger that will show which query is getting fired. as per doc if annotation is at field level that it should not part of the update statement."},{"owner":{"account_id":26040318,"reputation":21,"user_id":19745248,"display_name":"Mahrukh Saeed"},"score":0,"creation_date":1671892245,"post_id":74905591,"comment_id":132193509,"body_markdown":"can you just give me little code demo how to handle this case.","body":"can you just give me little code demo how to handle this case."}],"owner":{"account_id":26040318,"reputation":21,"user_id":19745248,"display_name":"Mahrukh Saeed"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1671892098,"creation_date":1671856119,"question_id":74905591,"body_markdown":"Is there anyway, don&#39;t update specific fields which are randomly generated using `@DynamicUpdate`\r\n\r\nFor example, i have jpa entity like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Data\r\n@Entity\r\n@Table(name = &quot;Classes&quot;)\r\n@NoArgsConstructor\r\n@AllArgsConstructor\r\n@Getter\r\n@Setter\r\n@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)\r\n@ToString\r\n@DynamicUpdate\r\npublic class Classes {\r\n\r\n    @Id\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;ClassId&quot;)\r\n    private Long classId;\r\n\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;CourseSourceId&quot;)\r\n    private String courseSourceId;\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;Name&quot;)\r\n    private String name;\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;Grades&quot;,updatable = false)\r\n    private String grades;\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;CourseId&quot;)\r\n    private String courseId;\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;ClassCode&quot;,updatable = false)\r\n    private String classCode;\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;Subjects&quot;)\r\n    private String subjects;\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;SubjectCodes&quot;)\r\n    private String subjectCodes;\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;Periods&quot;)\r\n    private String periods;\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;StaffSectionCode&quot;,updatable = false)\r\n    private String staffSectionCode;\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;StudentSectionCode&quot;,updatable = false)\r\n    private String studentSectionCode;\r\n    \r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen i use `(updatable=false)` on grades column it&#39;s not updated, but `StaffSectionCode` and `studentSectionCode` are getting updated because i am using `math.random` function.\r\n\r\nHere is my controller class, i am handling both post and put functionality in a same class.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n@PostMapping(value = &quot;/addClasses&quot;)\r\n@PreAuthorize(&quot;hasAuthority(&#39;Write&#39;)&quot;)\r\npublic ResponseEntity&lt;Object&gt;

You can obtain the right one via [`ServletContext#getMimeType()`][8] based on image file extension which you can extend and/or override via `&lt;mime-mapping&gt;` in `web.xml`.\n\nThat should be it. It almost writes code itself. Let&#39;s start with HTML (in [JSP][9]):\n\n&lt;!-- language: xhtml --&gt;\n\n    &lt;img src=&quot;${pageContext.request.contextPath}/images/foo.png&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;img src=&quot;${pageContext.request.contextPath}/images/bar.png&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;img src=&quot;${pageContext.request.contextPath}/images/baz.png&quot;&gt;\n\nYou can if necessary also dynamically set `src` with [EL][10] while iterating using [JSTL][11]:\n\n&lt;!-- language: xhtml --&gt;\n\n    &lt;c:forEach items=&quot;${imagenames}&quot; var=&quot;imagename&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;img src=&quot;${pageContext.request.contextPath}/images/${imagename}&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;/c:forEach&gt;\n\nThen define/create a [servlet][12] which listens on GET requests on URL pattern of `/images/*`, the below example uses plain vanilla JDBC for the job:\n\n    @WebServlet(&quot;/images/*&quot;)\n    public class ImageServlet extends HttpServlet {\n\n        // content=blob, name=varchar(255) UNIQUE.\n        private static final String SQL_FIND = &quot;SELECT content FROM Image WHERE name = ?&quot;;\n\n        @Resource(name=&quot;jdbc/yourDB&quot;) // For Tomcat, define as &lt;Resource&gt; in context.xml and declare as &lt;resource-ref&gt; in web.xml.\n        private DataSource dataSource;\n        \n        @Override\n        protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\n            String imageName = request.getPathInfo().substring(1); // Returns &quot;foo.png&quot;.\n\n            try (Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection(); PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(SQL_FIND)) {\n                statement.setString(1, imageName);\n                \n                try (ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery()) {\n                    if (resultSet.next()) {\n                        byte[] content = resultSet.getBytes(&quot;content&quot;);\n                        response.setContentType(getServletContext().getMimeType(imageName));\n                        response.setContentLength(content.length);\n                        response.getOutputStream().write(content);\n                    } else {\n                        response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_NOT_FOUND); // 404.\n                    }\n                }\n            } catch (SQLException e) {\n                throw new ServletException(&quot;Something failed at SQL/DB level.&quot;, e);\n            }\n        }\n\n    }\n\nThat&#39;s it. In case you worry about HEAD and caching headers and properly responding on those requests, use this [abstract template for static resource servlet][13].\n\n### See also:\n\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2299469/how-should-i-connect-to-jdbc-database-datasource-in-a-servlet-based-applicatio/\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7033676/how-to-upload-an-image-and-save-it-in-database\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1812244/simplest-way-to-serve-static-data-from-outside-the-application-server-in-a-java\n\n  [1]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/index.html\n  [2]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSet.html#getBytes-java.lang.String-\n  [3]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSet.html#getBinaryStream-java.lang.String-\n  [4]: http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/partpersist.htm#BNBPY\n  [5]: http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/Lob.html\n  [6]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/\n  [7]: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17\n  [8]: http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/ServletContext.html#getMimeType(java.lang.String)\n  [9]: https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jsp/info\n  [10]: https://stackoverflow.com/tags/el/info\n  [11]: https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jstl/info\n  [12]: https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlets/info\n  [13]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/132052/servlet-for-serving-static-content/29991447#29991447","title":"How to retrieve and display images from a database in a JSP page?","body":"<p>Let's see in steps what should happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>JSP is basically a view technology which is supposed to generate HTML output.</li>\n<li>To display an image in HTML, you need the HTML <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.</li>\n<li>To let it locate an image, you need to specify its <code>src</code> attribute.</li>\n<li>The <code>src</code> attribute needs to point to a valid <code>http://</code> URL and thus not a local disk file system path <code>file://</code> as that would never work when the server and client run at physically different machines.</li>\n<li>The image URL needs to have the image identifier in  either the request path (e.g. <code>http://example.com/context/images/foo.png</code>) or as request parameter (e.g. <code>http://example.com/context/images?id=1</code>).</li>\n<li>In JSP/Servlet world, you can let a Servlet listen on a certain URL pattern like <code>/images/*</code>, so that you can just execute some Java code on specific URL's.</li>\n<li>Images are binary data and are to be obtained as either a <code>byte[]</code> or <code>InputStream</code> from the DB, the <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JDBC API</a> offers the <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSet.html#getBytes-java.lang.String-\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>ResultSet#getBytes()</code></a> and <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSet.html#getBinaryStream-java.lang.String-\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>ResultSet#getBinaryStream()</code></a> for this, and <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/partpersist.htm#BNBPY\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JPA API</a> offers <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/persistence/Lob.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>@Lob</code></a> for this.</li>\n<li>In the Servlet you can just write this <code>byte[]</code> or <code>InputStream</code> to the <code>OutputStream</code> of the response the usual <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Java IO</a> way.</li>\n<li>The client side needs to be instructed that the data should be handled as an image, thus at least the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>Content-Type</code></a> response header needs to be set as well.

But according to your question, that is not a resource _per se_, but instead a directory (i.e., a package). And the problem appears to be the inconsistent behavior of `Class#getResource(String)` when the `String` argument denotes a directory. When your code is _not_ in a JRT image then the call to `#getResource(String)` will return a `URL`; when your code _is_ packaged in a JRT image then the same call will return `null`, despite the fact the directory exists. \r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know if this behavior is a bug or simply undefined. One interesting thing is [`ModuleReader#find(String)`][1] clearly is _capable_ of finding directories:\r\n\r\n&gt; Finds a resource, returning a URI to the resource in the module.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; If the module reader can determine that the name locates a directory then the resulting URI will end with a slash (`&#39;/&#39;`).\r\n\r\nThat indicates, to me at least, that what you&#39;re trying to do should be possible. But even that method fails when the module is packaged in a JRT image (by returning an empty `Optional`). Note that if you query the [`ModuleReader#list()`][2] method it will include directories when the module is **not** in a JRT image, but those same directories are not included when the module **is** in a JRT image.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve put a minimal example demonstrating this problem at the end of this answer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# A Solution\r\n\r\nI assume you&#39;re using these constants (e.g., `PATH_TO_IMG`) to do stuff like the following:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\nImage image = new Image(PATH_TO_IMG + &quot;foo.png&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich avoids having calls to `SomeClass.class.getResource(&quot;...&quot;).toString()` everywhere. If this is your goal, then I can think of at least one solution. Change your constants to simply reference the _resource root_. For example:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\npublic static final String IMG_ROOT = &quot;/img&quot;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen create a utility method to resolve the resource:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\npublic static String getImagePath(String name) {\r\n    var resource = IMG_ROOT + &quot;/&quot; + name;\r\n    var url = App.class.getResource(resource);\r\n    if (url == null) {\r\n        throw new RuntimeException(&quot;could not find resource: &quot; + resource);\r\n    }\r\n    return url.toString();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then you can use that utility method like so:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\nImage image = new Image(getImagePath(&quot;foo.png&quot;));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Possible Alternative\r\n\r\nAnother option might be to make use of the JRT `FileSystem` implementation. Something like the following:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\nFileSystem jrtFs = FileSystems.getFileSystem(URI.create(&quot;jrt:/&quot;));\r\nPath path = jrtFs.getPath(&quot;modules&quot;, &quot;&lt;module-name&gt;&quot;, &quot;img&quot;);\r\n// Note: Doesn&#39;t seem to include the trailing &#39;/&#39;\r\nString pathToImg = path.toUri().toString();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough you&#39;ll have to detect if your code is in a JRT image or not.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Minimal Example\r\n\r\nGiven this doesn&#39;t have to do with JavaFX specifically, I&#39;ve created a minimal example to demonstrate this problem.\r\n\r\n* Maven 3.8.6\r\n* OpenJDK 19.0.1 2022-10-18\r\n* Tested on Windows 11\r\n\r\n## Source Code\r\n\r\n#### Project structure:\r\n\r\n```lang-none\r\n|   pom.xml\r\n|\r\n\\---src\r\n    \\---main\r\n        +---java\r\n        |   |   module-info.java\r\n        |   |\r\n        |   \\---sample\r\n        |           Main.java\r\n        |\r\n        \\---resources\r\n            \\---data\r\n                    file.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### pom.xml:\r\n\r\n```lang-xml\r\n&lt;project xmlns=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0&quot;
