In this configuration file we use the feature of defining a property by referring to another property inside the same `application.yml` file:\r\n\r\n    my-games-app:\r\n      base-property: foo\r\n      games:\r\n        - game-one:\r\n            game-name: ${my-games-app.base-property}one\r\n            game-location: ${my-games-app.base-property}/one\r\n        - game-two:\r\n            game-name: ${my-games-app.base-property}two\r\n            game-location: ${my-games-app.base-property}/two\r\n\r\nAnd we have a `@ConfigurationProperties` bean loading `games` configuration:\r\n\r\n    @Configuration\r\n    @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = &quot;my-games-app.games&quot;)\r\n    public class GamesConfig {\r\n        private Map&lt;String, Game&gt; games;\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nUseless to say the above is just an example, in reality it is a very complex setup with `GamesConfig` bean being used as a constructor argument for many other beans inside our application:\r\n\r\n    @Component\r\n    public class GamesRunner {\r\n        private final GamesConfig gamesConfig;\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nEverything works as expected. The problem we have is related to testing the beans where `GamesConfig` is injected; in the above example `GamesRunner`. At the moment we use `@SpringBootTest` to get hold of the beans we want to test. This again, works OK but the main inconvenient is that the whole application needs to be started in order to access the `GamesConfig` bean. This means setting up a lot of infrastructure such as a Database a JMS message broker and a Kafka broker. This takes time and makes our CI builds longer to run which started to become a bit of an inconvenient. Because the beans we want to test don&#39;t need any other setup than having the `GamesConfig` constructor argument provided we would prefer to have unit tests in place rather than integration tests as they are much faster to run.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we want to be able to recreate `GamesConfig` by hand by parsing our `application.yml` with a test helper method. To do this we use [snakeyaml](https://github.com/snakeyaml) library:\r\n\r\n    public final class TestHelper {\r\n        public static GamesConfig getGamesConfig() {\r\n            var yaml = new Yaml();\r\n            var applicationYaml = (Map&lt;String, Object&gt;) yaml.load(readResourceAsString(&quot;application.yml&quot;);\r\n            return createGamesConfig(applicationYaml.get(&quot;games&quot;);\r\n       }\r\n       \r\n       private static GamesConfig createGamesConfig(Object config) {\r\n          // The config Object passed here is a `Map&lt;String, Map&lt;String, String&gt;&gt;`\r\n          // as defeined in our `games` entry in our `application.yml`.\r\n          // The issue is that game name and game locations are loaded exactly like \r\n          // configured without property place holders being resolved\r\n         return gamesConfig;\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWe resolved the issue by manually parsing the property placeholders and looking up their values in the `application.yml` file. Even if our own property placeholder implementation is quite generic, my feeling is that this extra work is not needed as it should be a basic expectation the library would have some specific set up to do this out of the box. Being very new to snakeyaml I hope someone else hit the same problem and knows how to do it.\r\n\r\nWe use snakeyaml because it just happened to be in the class path as a transitive dependency, we are open to any suggestions that would achieve the same thing.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.  ","title":"Snake Yaml: How to load yaml file resolving property placeholders","body":"<p>We have a spring boot application with configuration being driven from <code>application.yml</code> file. In this configuration file we use the feature of defining a property by referring to another property inside the same <code>application.yml</code> file:</p>\n<pre><code>my-games-app:\n  base-property: foo\n  games:\n    - game-one:\n        game-name: ${my-games-app.base-property}one\n        game-location: ${my-games-app.base-property}/one\n    - game-two:\n        game-name: ${my-games-app.base-property}two\n        game-location: ${my-games-app.base-property}/two\n</code></pre>\n<p>And we have a <code>@ConfigurationProperties</code> bean loading <code>games</code> configuration:</p>\n<pre><code>@Configuration\n@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = &quot;my-games-app.games&quot;)\npublic class GamesConfig {\n    private Map&lt;String, Game&gt; games;\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Useless to say the above is just an example, in reality it is a very complex setup with <code>GamesConfig</code> bean being used as a constructor argument for many other beans inside our application:</p>\n<pre><code>@Component\npublic class GamesRunner {\n    private final GamesConfig gamesConfig;\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Everything works as expected. The problem we have is related to testing the beans where <code>GamesConfig</code> is injected; in the above example <code>GamesRunner</code>. At the moment we use <code>@SpringBootTest</code> to get hold of the beans we want to test. This again, works OK but the main inconvenient is that the whole application needs to be started in order to access the <code>GamesConfig</code> bean. This means setting up a lot of infrastructure such as a Database a JMS message broker and a Kafka broker. This takes time and makes our CI builds longer to run which started to become a bit of an inconvenient. Because the beans we want to test don't need any other setup than having the <code>GamesConfig</code> constructor argument provided we would prefer to have unit tests in place rather than integration tests as they are much faster to run.</p>\n<p>In other words, we want to be able to recreate <code>GamesConfig</code> by hand by parsing our <code>application.yml</code> with a test helper method. To do this we use <a href=\"https://github.com/snakeyaml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">snakeyaml</a> library:</p>\n<pre><code>public final class TestHelper {\n    public static GamesConfig getGamesConfig() {\n        var yaml = new Yaml();\n        var applicationYaml = (Map&lt;String, Object&gt;) yaml.load(readResourceAsString(&quot;application.yml&quot;);\n        return createGamesConfig(applicationYaml.get(&quot;games&quot;);\n   }\n   \n   private static GamesConfig createGamesConfig(Object config) {\n      // The config Object passed here is a `Map&lt;String, Map&lt;String, String&gt;&gt;`\n      // as defeined in our `games` entry in our `application.yml`.\n      // The issue is that game name and game locations are loaded exactly like \n      // configured without property place holders being resolved\n     return gamesConfig;\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We resolved the issue by manually parsing the property placeholders and looking up their values in the <code>application.yml</code> file. Even if our own property placeholder implementation is quite generic, my feeling is that this extra work is not needed as it should be a basic expectation the library would have some specific set up to do this out of the box. Being very new to snakeyaml I hope someone else hit the same problem and knows how to do it.</p>\n<p>We use snakeyaml because it just happened to be in the class path as a transitive dependency, we are open to any suggestions that would achieve the same thing.</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","kotlin","gradle","jar"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":4623673,"reputation":6002,"user_id":4161471,"display_name":"aSemy"},"score":0,"creation_date":1672999469,"post_id":75029049,"comment_id":132403855,"body_markdown":"It&#39;s possible to create a &#39;far sources&#39; jar, but it could be difficult.
