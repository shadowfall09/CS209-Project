What you need is returning a `FindIterable&lt;Document&gt;` object that allows to execute the code to test associated to :\r\n\r\n    for (Document doc : cursorPersonDoc) {\r\n        emplinfo.setEmplFirstName(doc.getString(&quot;firstname&quot;));\r\n        emplinfo.setEmplLastName(doc.getString(&quot;lastname&quot;));\r\n        break;\r\n    }\r\n    return emplinfo;\r\n\r\nIn this way you can assert that the method does what it is designed to : \r\nsetting the first name and the last name from the retrieved `FindIterable&lt;Document&gt;`.   \r\n\r\nYou could use the `Mockito.mock()` method to mock `FindIterable&lt;Document&gt;` that is an [Iterable][1] (whereas the used `foreach`).  \r\nAdditionally, to not bother to mock individual methods of `Iterator` (`hasNext()`, `next()`) that could make you test less readable, use a `List` (that is also an `Iterable`) to populate the `Document`s and delegate the behavior of the mocked `FindIterable.iterator()` to `List.iterator()`.  \r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testGetMetaData() throws Exception {\r\n      ... \r\n      // add your document instances\r\n      final List&lt;Document&gt; documentsMocked = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n      documentsMocked.add(new Document(...));\r\n      documentsMocked.add(new Document(...));\r\n\r\n      // mock FindIterable&lt;Document&gt;\r\n       FindIterable&lt;Document&gt; findIterableMocked = (FindIterable&lt;Document&gt;) Mockito.mock(FindIterable.class);\r\n\r\n      // mock the behavior of FindIterable.iterator() by delegating to List.iterator()\r\n      when(findIterableMocked.iterator()).thenReturn(documentsMocked.iterator());\r\n\r\n      // record a behavior for Collection.find()\r\n      Mockito.when(collection.find(dbObj)).thenReturn(findIterableMocked);\r\n     \r\n      // execute your method to test\r\n      EmplInfo actualEmplInfo = personDocumentRepo.getMetaData(...);\r\n\r\n      // assert that actualEmplInfo has the expected state\r\n      Assert(...);\r\n      \r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would add that such a mock will probably not work :\r\n\r\n    Mockito.when(collection.find(new Document())).thenReturn(findIterable);\r\n\r\nMockito will intercept and replace the behavior of the method invoked on the mock only if the arguments in the recording match (in terms of `equals()`) with the arguments passed at runtime by the tested method.  \r\nAt runtime, the argument is build in this way :\r\n\r\n    BasicDBObject whereClauseCondition = getMetaDataWhereClause(objectId);\r\n    EmplInfo emplinfo= new EmplInfo ();\r\n    emplinfo.set_id(objectId);\r\n\r\nSo the argument in the mock recording should be equal to which one defined above.   \r\nNote that if `equals()` is not overriden/overridable for the arguments classes, you have some workarounds such as :\r\n \r\n- passing the object as argument in the method to test (require some refactoring). In this case, Mocked argument and the referenced passed at runtime in the method to test are necessarily equal as these refer the same object\r\n\r\n- matching any object of given type with `Mockito.any(Class&lt;T&gt;)`.

Redis transactions are not the same as for other datastores.  Even Multi/Exec doesn&#39;t work for what you want - first because there is no rollback. If you want rollback you will have to pull down both lists so you can restore - and hope that between our error condition and the &quot;rollback&quot; no other client also modified either of the lists. Doing this in a sane and reliable way is not trivial, nor simple. It would also probably not be a good question for SO as it would be very broad, and not Redis specific.\r\n\r\nNow as to why EXEC doesn&#39;t do what one might think. In your proposed scenario MULTI/EXEC *only* handles the cases of:\r\n\r\n 1. You set up WATCHes to ensure no other changes happened\r\n 2. Your client dies before issuing EXEC\r\n 3. Redis is out of memory\r\n\r\nIt is entirely possible to get errors as a result of issuing the EXEC command. When you issue EXEC, Redis will execute **all** commands in the queue and return a list of errors. It will not provide the case of the add-to-list-1 working and add-to-list-2 failing. You would still have your two lists out of sync. When you issue, say an LPUSH after issuing MULTI, you will always get back an `OK` unless you:\r\n\r\n - a) previously added a watch and something in that list changed or  \r\n - b) Redis returns an OOM condition in response to a queued push command\r\n\r\nDISCARD does not work like some might think. DISCARD is used **instead of** EXEC, not as a rollback mechanism. Once you issue EXEC your transaction is completed. Redis does not have any rollback mechanism at all - that isn&#39;t what Redis&#39; transaction are about.\r\n\r\nThe key to understanding what Redis calls transactions is to realize they are essentially a command queue at the client connection level. They are not a database state machine.","title":"How to implement transaction with rollback in Redis","body":"<p>If you need transaction rollback, I recommend using something other than Redis.

If you want rollback you will have to pull down both lists so you can restore - and hope that between our error condition and the \"rollback\" no other client also modified either of the lists. Doing this in a sane and reliable way is not trivial, nor simple. It would also probably not be a good question for SO as it would be very broad, and not Redis specific.</p>\n\n<p>Now as to why EXEC doesn't do what one might think. In your proposed scenario MULTI/EXEC <em>only</em> handles the cases of:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You set up WATCHes to ensure no other changes happened</li>\n<li>Your client dies before issuing EXEC</li>\n<li>Redis is out of memory</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It is entirely possible to get errors as a result of issuing the EXEC command. When you issue EXEC, Redis will execute <strong>all</strong> commands in the queue and return a list of errors. It will not provide the case of the add-to-list-1 working and add-to-list-2 failing. You would still have your two lists out of sync. When you issue, say an LPUSH after issuing MULTI, you will always get back an <code>OK</code> unless you:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a) previously added a watch and something in that list changed or  </li>\n<li>b) Redis returns an OOM condition in response to a queued push command</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>DISCARD does not work like some might think. DISCARD is used <strong>instead of</strong> EXEC, not as a rollback mechanism. Once you issue EXEC your transaction is completed. Redis does not have any rollback mechanism at all - that isn't what Redis' transaction are about.</p>\n\n<p>The key to understanding what Redis calls transactions is to realize they are essentially a command queue at the client connection level. They are not a database state machine.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3650558,"reputation":8277,"user_id":3042856,"accept_rate":94,"display_name":"Damaged Organic"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1690838381,"creation_date":1690836187,"answer_id":76807035,"question_id":39585903,"body_markdown":"There is a way, how clever/wrong it is, is up to you to decide.\r\n\r\nAs other colleagues have noticed, Redis transactions guarantee atomicity, but not at all consistency.

It isn't necessary or helpful.</p>\n<pre><code>                        try {\n                            Thread.sleep(500);\n                        } catch (InterruptedException ex) {\n                            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\n                        }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is done on the UI thread.  NEVER SLEEP ON THE UI THREAD.  If you need a delay on the UI thread, you post a message to the handler, or use a timer of some sort.  Never sleep.  Also the catch here is pointless-  the current thread is already interrupted.  What's the point in interrupting it again?</p>\n<p>Unrelated to performance-  you're also setting the onClick of the stop button in the onClick of the start button.  That's pointless.  Set it globally, and prevent the clicking of the stop button by either visibility (setting it gone or invisible) or by enablement (disabling it).    You can also improve the readability and maintainability of your code by breaking up those long onClicks into named functions that do particular things.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":21272415,"reputation":1,"user_id":20266598,"display_name":"Jonasoos"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1690832911,"creation_date":1690650483,"question_id":76794651,"body_markdown":"The buttons are not instantly dis-/reappearing and the code is very slow although i have no heavy operation running (skipping frames).
