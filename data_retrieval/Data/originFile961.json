Because you’re trying to put a double into an integer array (regardless of being accessed through a number reference).\r\n\r\nThis means that you can fool the compiler, but you cannot fool the runtime type system. And this is so because arrays are what we call *reifiable types*. This means that at runtime Java knows that this array was actually instantiated as an array of integers which simply happens to be accessed through a reference of type `Number[]`.\r\n\r\nSo, as you can see, one thing is the actual type of the object, and another thing is the type of the reference that you use to access it, right?\r\n\r\n**The Problem with Java Generics**\r\n\r\nNow, the problem with Java generic types is that the type information is discarded by the compiler and it is not available at run time. This process is called [type erasure][1]. There are good reason for implementing generics like this in Java, but that&#39;s a long story, and it has to do, among other things, with binary compatibility with pre-existing code (see [How we got the generics we have](http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/valhalla/erasure.html)).\r\n\r\nBut the important point here is that since, at runtime there is no type information, there is no way to ensure that we are not committing heap pollution.\r\n\r\nFor instance,\r\n\r\n    List&lt;Integer&gt; myInts = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();\r\n    myInts.add(1);\r\n    myInts.add(2);\r\n    \r\n    List&lt;Number&gt; myNums = myInts; //compiler error\r\n    myNums.add(3.14); //heap pollution\r\n\r\nIf the Java compiler does not stop you from doing this, the runtime type system cannot stop you either, because there is no way, at runtime, to determine that this list was supposed to be a list of integers only. The Java runtime would let you put whatever you want into this list, when it should only contain integers, because when it was created, it was declared as a list of integers.\r\n\r\nAs such, the designers of Java made sure that you cannot fool the compiler. If you cannot fool the compiler (as we can do with arrays) you cannot fool the runtime type system either.\r\n\r\nAs such, we say that generic types are *non-reifiable*.\r\n\r\nEvidently, this would hamper polymorphism. Consider the following example:\r\n\r\n    static long sum(Number[] numbers) {\r\n       long summation = 0;\r\n       for(Number number : numbers) {\r\n          summation += number.longValue();\r\n       }\r\n       return summation;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow you could use it like this:\r\n\r\n    Integer[] myInts = {1,2,3,4,5};\r\n    Long[] myLongs = {1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L};\r\n    Double[] myDoubles = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0};\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(sum(myInts));\r\n    System.out.println(sum(myLongs));\r\n    System.out.println(sum(myDoubles));\r\n\r\nBut if you attempt to implement the same code with generic collections, you will not succeed:\r\n\r\n    static long sum(List&lt;Number&gt; numbers) {\r\n       long summation = 0;\r\n       for(Number number : numbers) {\r\n          summation += number.longValue();\r\n       }\r\n       return summation;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou would get compiler erros if you try to...\r\n\r\n    List&lt;Integer&gt; myInts = asList(1,2,3,4,5);\r\n    List&lt;Long&gt; myLongs = asList(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L);\r\n    List&lt;Double&gt; myDoubles = asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0);\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(sum(myInts)); //compiler error\r\n    System.out.println(sum(myLongs)); //compiler error\r\n    System.out.println(sum(myDoubles)); //compiler error\r\n\r\nThe solution is to learn to use two powerful features of Java generics known as covariance and contravariance.\r\n\r\n**Covariance**\r\n\r\nWith covariance you can read items from a structure, but you cannot write anything into it. All these are valid declarations.\r\n\r\n    List&lt;? extends Number&gt; myNums = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();\r\n    List&lt;? extends Number&gt; myNums = new ArrayList&lt;Float&gt;();\r\n    List&lt;? extends Number&gt; myNums = new ArrayList&lt;Double&gt;();\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd you can read from `myNums`:\r\n\r\n    Number n = myNums.get(0); \r\n\r\nBecause you can be sure that whatever the actual list contains, it can be upcasted to a Number (after all anything that extends Number is a Number, right?)\r\n\r\nHowever, you are not allowed to put anything into a covariant structure.\r\n\r\n    myNumst.add(45L); //compiler error\r\n\r\nThis would not be allowed, because Java cannot guarantee what is the actual type of the object in the generic structure. It can be anything that extends Number, but the compiler cannot be sure. So you can read, but not write.\r\n\r\n**Contravariance**\r\n\r\nWith contravariance you can do the opposite. You can put things into a generic structure, but you cannot read out from it.\r\n\r\n    List&lt;Object&gt; myObjs = new List&lt;Object&gt;();\r\n    myObjs.add(&quot;Luke&quot;);\r\n    myObjs.add(&quot;Obi-wan&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    List&lt;? super Number&gt; myNums = myObjs;\r\n    myNums.add(10);\r\n    myNums.add(3.14);\r\n\r\nIn this case, the actual nature of the object is a List of Objects, and through contravariance, you can put Numbers into it, basically because all numbers have Object as their common ancestor. As such, all Numbers are objects, and therefore this is valid.\r\n\r\nHowever, you cannot safely read anything from this contravariant structure assuming that you will get a number. \r\n\r\n    Number myNum = myNums.get(0); //compiler-error\r\n\r\nAs you can see, if the compiler allowed you to write this line, you would get a ClassCastException at runtime (because item 0 in the list is an Object, not a Number).\r\n\r\n**Get/Put Principle**\r\n\r\nAs such, use covariance when you only intend to take generic values out of a structure, use contravariance when you only intend to put generic values into a structure, and use the exact generic type when you intend to do both.\r\n\r\nThe best example I have is the following which copies any kind of numbers from one list into another list. It only *gets* items from the source, and it only *puts* items in the target.\r\n\r\n    public static void copy(List&lt;? extends Number&gt; source, List&lt;? super Number&gt; target) {\r\n        for(Number number : source) {\r\n            target.add(number);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThanks to the powers of covariance and contravariance this works for a case like this:\r\n\r\n    List&lt;Integer&gt; myInts = asList(1,2,3,4);\r\n    List&lt;Double&gt; myDoubles = asList(3.14, 6.28);\r\n    List&lt;Object&gt; myObjs = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;();\r\n    \r\n    copy(myInts, myObjs);\r\n    copy(myDoubles, myObjs);\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.6\r\n","title":"What is a difference between &lt;? super E&gt; and &lt;? extends E&gt;?","body":"<p>The reasons for this are based on how Java implements generics.</p>\n<p><strong>An Arrays Example</strong></p>\n<p>With arrays you can do this (arrays are covariant)</p>\n<pre><code>Integer[] myInts = {1,2,3,4};\nNumber[] myNumber = myInts;\n</code></pre>\n<p>But, what would happen if you try to do this?</p>\n<pre><code>myNumber[0] = 3.14; //attempt of heap pollution\n</code></pre>\n<p>This last line would compile just fine, but if you run this code, you could get an <code>ArrayStoreException</code>.

It only <em>gets</em> items from the source, and it only <em>puts</em> items in the target.</p>\n<pre><code>public static void copy(List&lt;? extends Number&gt; source, List&lt;? super Number&gt; target) {\n    for(Number number : source) {\n        target.add(number);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thanks to the powers of covariance and contravariance this works for a case like this:</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; myInts = asList(1,2,3,4);\nList&lt;Double&gt; myDoubles = asList(3.14, 6.28);\nList&lt;Object&gt; myObjs = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;();\n\ncopy(myInts, myObjs);\ncopy(myDoubles, myObjs);\n</code></pre>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":543250,"reputation":18874,"user_id":912319,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"Kanagavelu Sugumar"},"score":0,"creation_date":1372073976,"post_id":15252219,"comment_id":25041685,"body_markdown":"@Dana Also See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15255929/generics-wildcards-assigning-super-class-object-to-a-subclass-object-list","body":"@Dana Also See <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15255929/generics-wildcards-assigning-super-class-object-to-a-subclass-object-list\" title=\"generics wildcards assigning super class object to a subclass object list\">stackoverflow.com/questions/15255929/&hellip;</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":543250,"reputation":18874,"user_id":912319,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"Kanagavelu Sugumar"},"score":0,"creation_date":1382552838,"post_id":15252219,"comment_id":29007976,"body_markdown":"My answer on Generic Class type http://stackoverflow.com/questions/462297/how-to-use-classt-in-java/19545123#19545123","body":"My answer on Generic Class type <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/462297/how-to-use-classt-in-java/19545123#19545123\" title=\"how to use classt in java\">stackoverflow.com/questions/462297/how-to-use-classt-in-java&zwnj;&#8203;/&hellip;</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":2846896,"reputation":5346,"user_id":2445025,"accept_rate":59,"display_name":"Prabhu"},"score":1,"creation_date":1409208398,"post_id":15252219,"comment_id":39881069,"body_markdown":"Good explanation with code.

First, `createSharedListViaStream`:\r\n```Java\r\npublic static List&lt;SchoolObj&gt; createSharedListViaStream(List&lt;SchoolObj&gt; listOne, List&lt;SchoolObj&gt; listTwo)\r\n{\r\n    // We create a stream of elements from the first list.\r\n    List&lt;SchoolObj&gt; listOneList = listOne.stream()\r\n    // We select any elements such that in the stream of elements from the second list\r\n    .filter(two -&gt; listTwo.stream()\r\n    // there is an element that has the same name and school as this element,\r\n        .anyMatch(one -&gt; one.getName().equals(two.getName()) \r\n            &amp;&amp; two.getSchool().equals(one.getSchool())))\r\n    // and collect all matching elements from the first list into a new list.\r\n    .collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n    // We return the collected list.\r\n    return listOneList;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAfter running through the code, it does exactly what you want it to do. Now, let&#39;s run through `createSharedListViaLoop`:\r\n```Java\r\npublic static List&lt;SchoolObj&gt; createSharedListViaLoop(List&lt;SchoolObj&gt; listOne, List&lt;SchoolObj&gt; listTwo)\r\n{\r\n    // We build up a result by...\r\n    List&lt;SchoolObj&gt; result = new ArrayList&lt;SchoolObj&gt;();\r\n    // going through each element in the first list,\r\n    for (SchoolObj one : listOne)\r\n    {\r\n    // going through each element in the second list,\r\n        for (SchoolObj two : listTwo)\r\n        {\r\n    // and collecting the first list&#39;s element if it matches the second list&#39;s element.\r\n            if (one.getName().equals(two.getName()) &amp;&amp; one.getSchool().equals(two.getSchool()))\r\n            {\r\n                result.add(one);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    // We return the collected list\r\n    return result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo far, so good... right? In fact, your code in `createSharedListViaStream` is fundamentally correct; instead, it is your `createSharedListViaLoop` that may be causing discrepancies in output.  \r\n\r\nThink about the following set of inputs:  \r\n`List1 = [SchoolObj(&quot;nameA&quot;,&quot;SchoolX&quot;), SchoolObj(&quot;nameC&quot;,&quot;SchoolZ&quot;)]`  \r\n`List2 = [SchoolObj(&quot;nameA&quot;,&quot;SchoolX&quot;), SchoolObj(&quot;nameA&quot;,&quot;SchoolX&quot;), SchoolObj(&quot;nameB&quot;,&quot;SchoolY&quot;)]`  \r\n\r\nHere, `createSharedListViaStream` will return the only element of the first list that appears in both lists: `SchoolObj(&quot;nameA&quot;,&quot;SchoolX&quot;)`. However, `createSharedListViaLoop` will return the following list: `[SchoolObj(&quot;nameA&quot;,&quot;SchoolX&quot;),SchoolObj(&quot;nameA&quot;,&quot;SchoolX&quot;)]`. More precisely, `createSharedListViaLoop` will collect the correct object, but it will do so twice. I suspect this to be the reason for the output of `createSharedListViaStream` to be &quot;incorrect&quot; based on comparison to the output of `createSharedListViaLoop`.  \r\n\r\nThe reason that `createSharedListViaLoop` does this duplication is based on the lack of termination of its inner for loop. Although we iterate over all elements of the first list to check if they are present in the second, finding a single match will suffice to add the element to the result. We can avoid redundant element addition by changing the inner loop to the following:\r\n```Java\r\nfor (SchoolObj one : listOne)\r\n    {\r\n    for (SchoolObj two : listTwo)\r\n    {\r\n        if (one.getName().equals(two.getName()) &amp;&amp; one.getSchool().equals(two.getSchool()))\r\n        {\r\n            result.add(one);\r\n            break;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAdditionally, if you don&#39;t want duplicate Objects in your list (by location in memory), you can use [distinct](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#distinct--) like so:\r\n```Java\r\nList&lt;SchoolObj&gt; result = ...;\r\nresult = result.stream().distinct().collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n```\r\nAs a final caution, the above will keep the results distinct in the following scenario:\r\n```Java\r\nList&lt;SchoolObj&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\nSchoolObj duplicate = new SchoolObj(&quot;nameC&quot;, &quot;schoolD&quot;);\r\nlistOne.add(duplicate);\r\nlistOne.add(duplicate);\r\nlist.stream().distinct().forEach(System.out::println); \r\n// prints:\r\n// nameC schoolD\r\n```\r\nHowever, it will not work in the following scenario, unless you override the [equals](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals-java.lang.Object-) method for SchoolObj:\r\n```Java\r\nList&lt;SchoolObj&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\nlistOne.add(new SchoolObj(&quot;nameC&quot;, &quot;schoolD&quot;));\r\nlistOne.add(new SchoolObj(&quot;nameC&quot;, &quot;schoolD&quot;));\r\nlist.stream().distinct().forEach(System.out::println); \r\n// prints (unless Object::equals overridden)\r\n// nameC schoolD\r\n// nameC schoolD\r\n```","title":"Java 8 Streams - Compare two Lists&#39; object values and add value to new List?","body":"<p>Let's run through each part of the code.

When we are deleting entity and causing changes in type - @PostUpdate callback is working in unexpected way. It seems to persist changes only in Building entity, completely ignoring Stage and Project. After checking via EntityManager.contains() - they are in managed state in the method that is inside of JPA @PostUpdate event, so I expected same behaviour - persist changes without explicitly calling to save() method.</p>\n<p>Building.java</p>\n<pre><code>@ToString(callSuper = true, onlyExplicitlyIncluded = true)\n@EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = true, onlyExplicitlyIncluded = true)\n@NoArgsConstructor\n@FieldDefaults(level = AccessLevel.PRIVATE)\n@SuperBuilder(toBuilder = true)\n@Entity\n@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)\n@Table(name = &quot;BUILDING&quot;, schema = &quot;---&quot;)\n@EntityListeners(BuildingListener.class)\n@Where(clause = &quot;DELETED = 0&quot;)\npublic class Building extends BaseEntity {\n\n    String name;\n    String description;\n    Date endDate;\n    Project project;\n    Stage stage;\n    CustomType type;\n\n    @Column(name = &quot;NAME&quot;)\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n   @Column(name = &quot;DESCRIPTION&quot;)\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n   @Column(name = &quot;END_DATE&quot;)\n    public Date getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    @ManyToOne(fetch = LAZY)\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;PROJECT_ID&quot;)\n    public Project getProject() {\n        return project;\n    }\n\n    @ManyToOne(fetch = LAZY)\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;STAGE_ID&quot;)\n    public Stage getStage() {\n        return stage;\n    }\n\n@ManyToOne\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;TYPE&quot;)\n    public CustomType getType(){\n        return type;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Project.java</p>\n<pre><code>@Data\n@ToString(callSuper = true, onlyExplicitlyIncluded = true)\n@EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = true, onlyExplicitlyIncluded = true)\n@NoArgsConstructor\n@FieldDefaults(level = AccessLevel.PRIVATE)\n@SuperBuilder(toBuilder = true)\n@Entity\n@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)\n@Table(name = &quot;PROJECT&quot;, schema = &quot;---&quot;)\n@Where(clause = &quot;DELETED = 0&quot;)\npublic class Project extends BaseEntity {\n\n    String name;\n    String description;\n    List&lt;Stage&gt;

For example in Service1 this is the structure:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JetZ4.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Project_structure</a></p>\n<p>In jacocoReport it shows that the &quot;api&quot; folder is 0% covered, although there are tests for methods in this folder and they are in the Autotests module.</p>\n<p>If anyone has any idea how to fix it, I will be very grateful.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","mysql","jdbc","resultset"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":22124137,"reputation":3297,"user_id":16376827,"display_name":"g00se"},"score":0,"creation_date":1665762522,"post_id":74071520,"comment_id":130781422,"body_markdown":"We can&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with this custom Java db code (&#39;database&#39; etc.) as you haven&#39;t posted it","body":"We can&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with this custom Java db code (&#39;database&#39; etc.) as you haven&#39;t posted it"},{"owner":{"account_id":23386636,"reputation":15,"user_id":17451881,"display_name":"Ricardo"},"score":0,"creation_date":1665769325,"post_id":74071520,"comment_id":130783425,"body_markdown":"@g00se I updated the information, if necessary I can include more code.","body":"@g00se I updated the information, if necessary I can include more code."}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":23386636,"reputation":15,"user_id":17451881,"display_name":"Ricardo"},"score":1,"creation_date":1665896451,"post_id":74073648,"comment_id":130804009,"body_markdown":"I changed all my methods and made use of try-with-resources and it has been fixed, apparently the other methods were influencing, thanks!","body":"I changed all my methods and made use of try-with-resources and it has been fixed, apparently the other methods were influencing, thanks!"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":12221317,"reputation":569,"user_id":8920328,"display_name":"Melron"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1665773509,"creation_date":1665773509,"answer_id":74073648,"question_id":74071520,"body_markdown":"executeQuery is probably closing the database connection and you try to execute a statement again.\r\n\r\nI suggest you to handle the open and the close in the place you are calling the statements to avoid these issues.\r\n\r\nIf you are using java 8 features, keep in mind that Connection, PreparedStatement and ResultSet, are all auto-closeable.

With some changes, you can avoid the extra checks like that:</p>\n<pre><code>public String alarmClock(int day, boolean vacation){\n    if (0 &lt; day &amp;&amp; day != 6){\n        return vacation ? &quot;10:00&quot; : &quot;7:00&quot;;\n    }\n    \n    return &quot;off&quot;;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>P.s I'm not sure about the day checks, i used your condition instead of the second example</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":22057425,"reputation":135,"user_id":16320675,"display_name":"user16320675"},"score":0,"creation_date":1665779201,"post_id":74074061,"comment_id":130786228,"body_markdown":"maybe the compiler is &quot;*so clever*&quot; to not assume that `vacation` cannot be changed (however&#185;) in between both `if` statements.... || **&#185;** not trivial, since it is a local variable/parameter... but maybe weaving like in AspectJ or I believe some mocking framework) || at the end it is just how it is specified...","body":"maybe the compiler is &quot;<i>so clever</i>&quot; to not assume that <code>vacation</code> cannot be changed (however&#185;) in between both <code>if</code> statements.... || <b>&#185;</b> not trivial, since it is a local variable/parameter... but maybe weaving like in AspectJ or I believe some mocking framework) || at the end it is just how it is specified..."}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":960307,"reputation":107861,"user_id":984823,"display_name":"Joop Eggen"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1665777033,"creation_date":1665775959,"answer_id":74074061,"question_id":74073755,"body_markdown":"When you replace `if (vacation)` with `else` every control flow returns a value.

Surely if I just fed my publicly available public key to this function, then I would get authenticated? </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","string","joptionpane","is-empty"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1691630,"reputation":49583,"user_id":1553851,"accept_rate":73,"display_name":"shmosel"},"score":0,"creation_date":1665774254,"post_id":74073552,"comment_id":130784880,"body_markdown":"You can avoid the nesting by skipping the `else` and calling `continue;` instead of relying on `error`.","body":"You can avoid the nesting by skipping the <code>else</code> and calling <code>continue;</code> instead of relying on <code>error</code>."},{"owner":{"account_id":6457401,"reputation":583,"user_id":5002324,"display_name":"Christoph S."},"score":1,"creation_date":1665777716,"post_id":74073552,"comment_id":130785843,"body_markdown":"Either you pass the loop one time or infinite, because you don&#39;t set `error` back to 0 at next loop (should happen at the beginning of the loop)","body":"Either you pass the loop one time or infinite, because you don&#39;t set <code>error</code> back to 0 at next loop (should happen at the beginning of the loop)"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1691630,"reputation":49583,"user_id":1553851,"accept_rate":73,"display_name":"shmosel"},"score":0,"creation_date":1665774184,"post_id":74073704,"comment_id":130784862,"body_markdown":"Note that this doesn&#39;t restart the input loop on error, as it does in the question.","body":"Note that this doesn&#39;t restart the input loop on error, as it does in the question."},{"owner":{"account_id":20065359,"reputation":746,"user_id":14711162,"display_name":"Binjie Liang"},"score":1,"creation_date":1665777783,"post_id":74073704,"comment_id":130785872,"body_markdown":"Thanks!

For [JavaFX 3D work](https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/OpenJFX/3D+Features), it is recommended to use [Java 8](https://jdk8.java.net/download.html).  \r\n 2. For building a cube, use a [Box](http://download.java.net/jdk8/jfxdocs/javafx/scene/shape/Box.html) shape.\r\n 3. For other geometry types, use a [Sphere][2], [Cylinder][3] or [MeshView][4].  \r\n 4. Use [Point][5] and [Ambient][6] lights to illuminate your Scene.\r\n 5. Apply [Materials][7] to your 3D objects to shade them.\r\n 6. Use [Model importers][8] to import complex mesh models.\r\n 7. [Builders](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/openjfx-dev/2013-March/006725.html) are deprecated.\r\n 8. For handling animation it is not recommended to spawn another thread, but to use the [JavaFX animation package][9].\r\n 9. For the particular animation in your question, a [RotateTransition][10] is the appropriate animation.\r\n 10. Your solution is not threadsafe.  You should not modify properties of nodes in the active scene graph (e.g. the transform properties of a displayed node) off of the application thread (use [Platform.runLater][11] instead).\r\n 11. You are not creating a scene with [depth buffering][12] set to true.  The depth buffering flag tells JavaFX that it should apply depth sorting and culling to 3D objects.\r\n\r\nAlso check that your system supports JavaFX 3D:\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(\r\n

Download mechanism and retrieval/placement from/in cache (local\r\n    files system) are already taken care of. \r\n 2. Single-threaded and single request per URL.\r\n\r\nI wrote a method that uses getFileFromLocalFS() and getFileFromWeb() to implement a simplified logic of caching:\r\n\r\n    public InputStream getFile(String url) { // #1\r\n    \tInputStream retStream = getFileFromLocalFS(url);\r\n    \tif (retStream != null) {\r\n    \t\treturn retStream;\t\t\t\r\n    \t}\r\n    \telse {\r\n    \t\tretStream = getFileFromLocalFS(url);\r\n    \t\tif (retStream == null) {\r\n    \t\t\treturn getFileFromWeb(url);\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t}\r\n    \treturn retStream;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis schematic solution then needed to be improved to accommodate **concurrent** requests to download from same URL...and limit actual &quot;from Web&quot; to a **single** download (i.e. all other requests will get it from the local file system).

(There can be at most one such mapping.)&quot;*\r\n\r\nAnd the API specification of `SortedMap` states:\r\n\r\n*&quot;All keys inserted into a sorted map must implement the `Comparable` interface (or be accepted by the specified comparator)&quot;* and\r\n\r\n*&quot;Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map (whether or not an explicit comparator is provided) must be consistent with equals if the sorted map is to correctly implement the `Map` interface.&quot;*\r\n\r\nIt is this latter paragraph that I had forgotten when I posted this question. Hence, the above behaviour mentioned in the question is expected, even if it is bizarre. So To get consistent behaviour between `Map` and `SortedMap` `Object::equals` must be overridden to be consistent with the `Comparable` or `Comparator`, whichever is being used. \r\n\r\nThis is quite a serious requirement / restriction because it means that you should only ever use maps with comparators in combination with keys where the key&#39;s implementation overrides `Object::equals` to be consistent with the bespoke comparator&#39;s version of equals. I.e. in principle for every bespoke comparator there should be a corresponding bespoke key. I think this point is easily missed; I certainly missed it.\r\n\r\nA corollary of this requirement is that objects that are not specifically designed as bespoke keys for some bespoke comparator cannot in general  be used as keys for a map with a bespoke comparator (something/anything inheriting `SortedMap`) since in general the map will break the contract for `Map`. I find this whole situation problematic. I think it would be more consistent to utilise the following comparison hierarchy for all maps (including `Map`):\r\n\r\n- If present, `Comparator&lt;T&gt;`, else\r\n- if defined for the supplied key type, `Comparable&lt;T&gt;`, else\r\n- if overridden for the supplied key type, `Object::equals`, else\r\n- use the default `Object::equals`, i.e. `==`.\r\n\r\nI.e. if a comparator has been supplied to a map, use it, otherwise if the key is comparable, use that, otherwise use the key&#39;s `equal(Object)` method, the default implementation of which is `==`. Implementations of `Map` that do not permit bespoke comparators (effectively anything that is NOT a `SortedMap`) would need to accept comparators (and use `Comparable&lt;T&gt;` where available when a comparator is not supplied) for the purpose of defining equivalence classes (not for ordering). For this purpose it might be useful to define the concept of an &quot;`Equalator&lt;T&gt;`&quot;, or &quot;`Equivalencer&lt;T&gt;`&quot; to provide the necessary bespoke definition of equals (equivalence) for keys of type `T` present in some `Map`. This avoids the need to define a sort order for maps that don&#39;t require it / don&#39;t accept bespoke sort orders.

(There can be at most one such mapping.)&quot;</em></p>\n<p>And the API specification of <code>SortedMap</code> states:</p>\n<p><em>&quot;All keys inserted into a sorted map must implement the <code>Comparable</code> interface (or be accepted by the specified comparator)&quot;</em> and</p>\n<p><em>&quot;Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted map (whether or not an explicit comparator is provided) must be consistent with equals if the sorted map is to correctly implement the <code>Map</code> interface.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>It is this latter paragraph that I had forgotten when I posted this question. Hence, the above behaviour mentioned in the question is expected, even if it is bizarre. So To get consistent behaviour between <code>Map</code> and <code>SortedMap</code> <code>Object::equals</code> must be overridden to be consistent with the <code>Comparable</code> or <code>Comparator</code>, whichever is being used.</p>\n<p>This is quite a serious requirement / restriction because it means that you should only ever use maps with comparators in combination with keys where the key's implementation overrides <code>Object::equals</code> to be consistent with the bespoke comparator's version of equals. I.e. in principle for every bespoke comparator there should be a corresponding bespoke key. I think this point is easily missed; I certainly missed it.</p>\n<p>A corollary of this requirement is that objects that are not specifically designed as bespoke keys for some bespoke comparator cannot in general  be used as keys for a map with a bespoke comparator (something/anything inheriting <code>SortedMap</code>) since in general the map will break the contract for <code>Map</code>. I find this whole situation problematic. I think it would be more consistent to utilise the following comparison hierarchy for all maps (including <code>Map</code>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If present, <code>Comparator&lt;T&gt;</code>, else</li>\n<li>if defined for the supplied key type, <code>Comparable&lt;T&gt;</code>, else</li>\n<li>if overridden for the supplied key type, <code>Object::equals</code>, else</li>\n<li>use the default <code>Object::equals</code>, i.e. <code>==</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I.e. if a comparator has been supplied to a map, use it, otherwise if the key is comparable, use that, otherwise use the key's <code>equal(Object)</code> method, the default implementation of which is <code>==</code>. Implementations of <code>Map</code> that do not permit bespoke comparators (effectively anything that is NOT a <code>SortedMap</code>) would need to accept comparators (and use <code>Comparable&lt;T&gt;</code> where available when a comparator is not supplied) for the purpose of defining equivalence classes (not for ordering). For this purpose it might be useful to define the concept of an &quot;<code>Equalator&lt;T&gt;</code>&quot;, or &quot;<code>Equivalencer&lt;T&gt;</code>&quot; to provide the necessary bespoke definition of equals (equivalence) for keys of type <code>T</code> present in some <code>Map</code>. This avoids the need to define a sort order for maps that don't require it / don't accept bespoke sort orders. Comparators could be modified to inherit <code>Equalator&lt;T&gt;</code> to provide explicit equivalence as well as a sort order (<code>Comparator&lt;T&gt;</code> in general implies an implicit definition of equivalence anyway).</p>\n<p>This change to the <code>Map</code> API specification would avoid the need to define a bespoke key for every comparator for <code>SortedMap</code>s, and allow the use of general objects as keys without breaking the contract for <code>Map</code>.
