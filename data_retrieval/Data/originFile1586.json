I believe that this includes an instance of 'this' and the book implies that this can be done without any modifications to the class of LogfileReader.</p>\n\n<p>This is the relevant bit of code in LogfileAnalyzer:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class LogAnalyzer\n{\n// Where to calculate the hourly access counts.\nprivate int[] hourCounts;\n// Use a LogfileReader to access the data.\nprivate LogfileReader reader;\n\n/**\n * Create an object to analyze hourly web accesses.\n * Reads files created in LogfileCreator\n */\n  public LogAnalyzer(LogfileReader r)\n  {\n     this.reader = r;\n     hourCounts = new int[24];\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And it is based on a previous answered question of a similar nature. </p>\n\n<p>After creating the file using LogfileCreator and typing in the string (\"This Blog\") into the prompt for LogfileAnalyzer(LogfileReader r), I end up with the String error above. </p>\n\n<p>If this helps, this is the full code for the LogfileReader class: </p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.io.File;\nimport java.io.FileNotFoundException;\nimport java.net.URISyntaxException;\nimport java.net.URL;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Collections;\nimport java.util.Iterator;\nimport java.util.Random;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\n/**\n * A class to read information from a file of web server accesses.\n * Currently, the log file is assumed to contain simply\n * date and time information in the format:\n *\n *    year month day hour minute\n * Log entries are sorted into ascending order of date.\n * \n * @author David J.

How can I fix this?</p>\n<p>(I'm not sure if the post method will actually log users in correctly, I just want to get it to run so I can figure that part out.)</p>\n<p>The full code is here: <a href=\"https://github.com/Skyler827/SpacePong/tree/7530377a634f1a2fe55ce490402d947616439e72\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/Skyler827/SpacePong/tree/7530377a634f1a2fe55ce490402d947616439e72</a><br />\nThe Security configurer method:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>protected void configure (HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\n    http\n        .csrf()\n            .ignoringAntMatchers(&quot;/h2/**&quot;)\n            .and()\n        .headers()\n            .frameOptions().sameOrigin().and()\n        .authorizeRequests()\n            .antMatchers(&quot;/login&quot;, &quot;/register&quot;, &quot;/h2/**&quot;).permitAll()\n            .antMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, &quot;/login&quot;).permitAll()\n            .anyRequest().authenticated()\n            .and()\n        .formLogin()\n            .loginProcessingUrl(&quot;/login&quot;)\n            .loginPage(&quot;/login&quot;)\n            .failureUrl(&quot;/login?error=true&quot;)\n            .successForwardUrl(&quot;/&quot;)\n            .and()\n        .logout()\n            .logoutUrl(&quot;/logout&quot;)\n            .logoutSuccessUrl(&quot;/&quot;)\n            .permitAll();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the Controller which should be working but isn't:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Controller\n@RequestMapping(&quot;/login&quot;)\npublic class LoginController {\n    private final AuthenticationManager authManager;\n    private final PlayerService playerService;\n    public LoginController(AuthenticationManager authManager, PlayerService playerService) {\n        this.authManager = authManager;\n        this.playerService = playerService;\n    }\n    @GetMapping\n    public String getLogin(Model model) {\n        model.addAttribute(&quot;playerdto&quot;, new PlayerDto());\n        System.out.println(&quot;running getLogin()&quot;);\n        return &quot;login&quot;;\n    }\n    @PostMapping\n    public String postLogin(@ModelAttribute(&quot;playerdto&quot;) PlayerDto playerDto, Model model) {\n        System.out.println(&quot;running postLogin()&quot;);\n        Player player = playerService.getPlayerByName(playerDto.getUsername());\n        if (player == null) {\n            model.addAttribute(&quot;error&quot;, &quot;invalid login&quot;);\n            return &quot;login&quot;;\n        }\n\n        UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authReq = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(\n                playerDto.getUsername(), playerDto.getPassword());\n        Authentication auth = authManager.authenticate(authReq);\n\n        return &quot;redirect:/&quot;;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","spring-data-jpa","projection"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":18874530,"reputation":21,"user_id":13768345,"display_name":"Khalid ECH-CHERQAOUI"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1645031128,"creation_date":1645031128,"answer_id":71146202,"question_id":71145058,"body_markdown":"you are defining **Address** as an expected response in the **AddressRepository** \r\n\r\nBy calling **getAddressByState()** AND **findAll()** you will get Adress and not AddressView,\r\nthink of using DTO","title":"Ambiguous comportement from spring data with projectors","body":"<p>you are defining <strong>Address</strong> as an expected response in the <strong>AddressRepository</strong></p>\n<p>By calling <strong>getAddressByState()</strong> AND <strong>findAll()</strong> you will get Adress and not AddressView,\nthink of using DTO</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":9941240,"reputation":45,"user_id":9908593,"display_name":"Hicham Cheikhaoui"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1645031128,"creation_date":1645026859,"question_id":71145058,"body_markdown":"Any one can help me ?

In section properties one then can set `VAlign` for the section above.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately does `apche poi` not provide setting section properties up to now. So the low level `org.openxmlformats.schemas.wordprocessingml.x2006.main.*` classes must be used to achieve the same.\r\n\r\nThe folowing complete example also shows this. It puts a paragraph with section break next page for section above. So the first paragraph is on it&#39;s own page. Then it sets page vertical align to center for page above (section above).\r\n\r\n    import java.io.*;\r\n    \r\n    import org.apache.poi.xwpf.usermodel.*;\r\n    import org.apache.poi.wp.usermodel.*;\r\n    \r\n    public class CreateWordParagraphAndPageAlignment {\r\n        \r\n     static void createSomeRichTextContent(XWPFParagraph paragraph) {\r\n      XWPFRun run = paragraph.createRun();  \r\n      run.setText(&quot;Aligned &quot;);\r\n      run.setFontSize(11);\r\n      run = paragraph.createRun();  \r\n      run.setText(&quot;paragraph &quot;);\r\n      run.setFontSize(22);\r\n      run = paragraph.createRun();  \r\n      run.setText(&quot;having &quot;);\r\n      run.setFontSize(33);\r\n      run = paragraph.createRun();  \r\n      run.setText(&quot;various &quot;);\r\n      run.setFontSize(22);\r\n      run = paragraph.createRun();  \r\n      run.setText(&quot;font sizes&quot;);\r\n      run.setFontSize(11);\r\n     }\r\n    \r\n     public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n    \r\n      XWPFDocument document = new XWPFDocument();\r\n      \r\n      XWPFParagraph paragraph = document.createParagraph();\r\n      XWPFRun run = paragraph.createRun();  \r\n      run.setText(&quot;Default paragraph in first page, which has page vertical alignment set.&quot;);\r\n      run.setFontSize(44);\r\n      paragraph = document.createParagraph();\r\n    \r\n      //paragraph with section break next page for section above\r\n      paragraph = document.createParagraph();\r\n      org.openxmlformats.schemas.wordprocessingml.x2006.main.CTSectPr ctSectPr = paragraph.getCTP().addNewPPr().addNewSectPr();\r\n      ctSectPr.addNewType().setVal(org.openxmlformats.schemas.wordprocessingml.x2006.main.STSectionMark.NEXT_PAGE);\r\n      //set page vertical align center for page above (section above)\r\n      ctSectPr.addNewVAlign().setVal(org.openxmlformats.schemas.wordprocessingml.x2006.main.STVerticalJc.CENTER);\r\n      //page size setting (A4) for the section above\r\n      org.openxmlformats.schemas.wordprocessingml.x2006.main.CTPageSz ctPageSz = ctSectPr.addNewPgSz();\r\n      ctPageSz.setW(java.math.BigInteger.valueOf(Math.round(8.27d*72d*20d))); //A4 = 8.27&quot; * 72 * 20 = Twips\r\n      ctPageSz.setH(java.math.BigInteger.valueOf(Math.round(11.69d*72d*20d))); //A4 = 11.69&quot; * 72 * 20 = Twips\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      paragraph = document.createParagraph();\r\n      run = paragraph.createRun();  \r\n      run.setText(&quot;Default paragraph&quot;);\r\n    \r\n      paragraph = document.createParagraph();\r\n      paragraph.setAlignment(ParagraphAlignment.CENTER);\r\n      paragraph.setVerticalAlignment(TextAlignment.AUTO);\r\n      createSomeRichTextContent(paragraph);\r\n    \r\n      paragraph = document.createParagraph();\r\n      paragraph.setAlignment(ParagraphAlignment.CENTER);\r\n      paragraph.setVerticalAlignment(TextAlignment.BASELINE);\r\n      createSomeRichTextContent(paragraph);\r\n      \r\n      paragraph = document.createParagraph();\r\n      paragraph.setAlignment(ParagraphAlignment.CENTER);\r\n      paragraph.setVerticalAlignment(TextAlignment.BOTTOM);\r\n      createSomeRichTextContent(paragraph);\r\n    \r\n      paragraph = document.createParagraph();\r\n      paragraph.setAlignment(ParagraphAlignment.CENTER);\r\n      paragraph.setVerticalAlignment(TextAlignment.CENTER);\r\n      createSomeRichTextContent(paragraph);\r\n      \r\n      paragraph = document.createParagraph();\r\n      paragraph.setAlignment(ParagraphAlignment.CENTER);\r\n      paragraph.setVerticalAlignment(TextAlignment.TOP);\r\n      createSomeRichTextContent(paragraph);\r\n      \r\n      paragraph = document.createParagraph();\r\n      \r\n      // page size setting (A4) for the last section above must be at last in body\r\n      ctSectPr = document.getDocument().getBody().addNewSectPr();\r\n      ctPageSz = ctSectPr.addNewPgSz();\r\n      ctPageSz.setW(java.math.BigInteger.valueOf(Math.round(8.27d*72d*20d))); //A4 = 8.27&quot; * 72 * 20 = Twips\r\n      ctPageSz.setH(java.math.BigInteger.valueOf(Math.round(11.69d*72d*20d))); //A4 = 11.69&quot; * 72 * 20 = Twips\r\n    \r\n      FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(&quot;./CreateWordParagraphAndPageAlignment.docx&quot;);\r\n      document.write(out);\r\n      out.close();\r\n      document.close();\r\n    \r\n     }\r\n    }","title":"How to center a paragraph vertically in Apache POI Java?","body":"<p><a href=\"https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/dev/org/apache/poi/xwpf/usermodel/XWPFParagraph.html#setVerticalAlignment-org.apache.poi.xwpf.usermodel.TextAlignment-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">XWPFParagraph.setVerticalAlignment</a> is not made for vertical aligning a paragraph on the page.

The OPDS Catalog schema overrides atom.rnc\n    to provide a relatively accurate test.

I can even not select anything and only hit the &quot;Click to View Library Content&quot; button and it will give me the dictionaries. \r\n\r\n**Question:** How do I make the dictionary radio button, and only the dictionary button, print out the dictionary results?\r\n\r\n**GUI Class (Look at first method of class in constructor):**\r\n\r\n    import java.awt.*;\r\n    import

to JButton for accurate Output","body":"<p><strong>Background info:</strong> In my program I have a text file, that is read in, and contains a list of different book types with their respected info. I have successfully passed an array of these text values to my dictionary class. Inside the dictionary class, I load it with the correct data, or in other words, all the books identified as dictionaries by the integer 2. Then I pass it back to my GUI class where I have made and utilize an ActionListener and actionPerformed method. I created a list of radio buttons (in this example focusing on just the dictionary one) and when I select dictionary and hit the &quot;Click to View Library Content&quot; it should give me the all the dictionary results in a nice JTable(JTable works correctly already).</p>\n<p><strong>My problem:</strong> The radio buttons are not linked to the &quot;Click to View Library Content&quot; button, so I can click any of the radio buttons and it will give the same dictionary results. I can even not select anything and only hit the &quot;Click to View Library Content&quot; button and it will give me the dictionaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> How do I make the dictionary radio button, and only the dictionary button, print out the dictionary results?</p>\n<p><strong>GUI Class (Look at first method of class in constructor):</strong></p>\n<pre><code>import java.awt.*;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionEvent;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionListener;\nimport java.awt.event.FocusEvent;\nimport java.awt.event.FocusListener;\nimport java.awt.event.KeyEvent;\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.io.PrintWriter;\nimport java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.logging.Level;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\nimport javax.swing.Box;\nimport static javax.swing.Box.createHorizontalBox;\nimport javax.swing.ButtonGroup;\nimport javax.swing.ImageIcon;\nimport javax.swing.JButton;\nimport javax.swing.JFileChooser;\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\nimport javax.swing.JLabel;\nimport javax.swing.JOptionPane;\nimport javax.swing.JPanel;\nimport javax.swing.JRadioButton;\nimport javax.swing.JScrollPane;\nimport javax.swing.JTable;\nimport javax.swing.JTextArea;\nimport javax.swing.JTextField;\n\npublic class GUICommandFunctions extends JPanel {\n\n    private final JButton ViewAllContentButton;\n    private final JPanel radioButtonPanelOne;\n    private final JPanel radioButtonPanelTwo;\n    private final JRadioButton allBookTypes;\n    private final JRadioButton dictionary;\n    private final JRadioButton cookbook;\n    private final JRadioButton novel;\n    private final JRadioButton graphicNovel;\n    private final JRadioButton allAuthors;\n    private final JRadioButton DouglasAdams;\n    private final JRadioButton BrianKVaughan;\n    private final JRadioButton AlanMoore;\n    private final JRadioButton NealStephenson;\n    private final JRadioButton BrandonSanderson;\n    private final JRadioButton MichaelShaara;\n    private final JRadioButton NeilGaiman;\n    private final JRadioButton english;\n    private final JRadioButton french;\n    private final JTextArea MiddleField;\n    private final JPanel searchPanel;\n    private JTextField searchFunction = new JTextField();\n    private final JLabel searchInventory = new JLabel(&quot;Library Inventory&quot;);\n    private ButtonGroup btnGroup1 = new ButtonGroup();\n    private ButtonGroup btnGroup2 = new ButtonGroup();\n    public String ArrayRecords[];\n    public JFrame f;\n    public JTable j;\n    \n    // Constructor\n    GUICommandFunctions() {\n        \n         Frame initialization  ***// FROM HERE***\n        f = new JFrame();\n        // Frame Title\n        f.setTitle(&quot;JTable Example&quot;);\n \n        LoadArrayData();\n     \n        this.setLayout(new BorderLayout());
