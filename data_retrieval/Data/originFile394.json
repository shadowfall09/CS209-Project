You need the DI container to instantiate them, which makes your tests more like integration tests\r\n- Your real dependencies are hidden from the outside and are not reflected in your interface (either constructors or methods)\r\n- It is really easy to have like ten dependencies. If you were using constructor injection, you would have a constructor with ten arguments, which would signal that something is fishy. But you can add injected fields using field injection indefinitely. Having too many dependencies is a red flag that the class usually does more than one thing, and that it may violate the Single Responsibility Principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\r\nDepending on your needs, you should primarily use constructor injection or some mix of constructor and setter injection.

Is there a better way to design it (I know long term its probably better to run multiple Java processes but right now I am just trying to manage a single file and I suspect there's a way to give the socket service a higher priority than processing the queue within the file but if they are both running in different files I don't know how to lower one over the other instead of them fighting for resources)?</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, I want it to provide a service to other systems (server socket, in the example) and when its idle I want it to do a few other tasks.</p>\n<p>Example (if you understand what I'm asking this code may not be necessary to read):</p>\n<pre><code>import java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.ObjectInputStream;\nimport java.io.ObjectOutputStream;\nimport java.net.ServerSocket;\nimport java.net.Socket;\n\n\npublic class multipleThreads {\n\n    private ServerSocket server;\n    private int port = 7777;\n\n    public void ServerSocketExample() {\n        try {\n            server = new ServerSocket(port);\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n    \n    \n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        System.out.println(&quot;starting&quot;);\n        \n        ServerSocketExample example = new ServerSocketExample();\n        example.handleConnection();\n        \n        while (true) {\n            //monitor low low priority queue\n        }       \n    }\n    public void handleConnection() {\n        System.out.println(&quot;Waiting for client message...&quot;);\n\n        //\n        // The server do a loop here to accept all connection initiated by the\n        // client application.\n        //\n        while (true) {\n            try {\n                Socket socket = server.accept();\n                new ConnectionHandler(socket);\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\nclass ConnectionHandler implements Runnable {\n    private Socket socket;\n\n    public ConnectionHandler(Socket socket) {\n        this.socket = socket;\n\n        Thread t = new Thread(this);\n        t.start();\n    }\n\n    public void run() {\n        try\n        {\n            //\n            // Read a message sent by client application\n            //\n            ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(socket.getInputStream());\n            String message = (String) ois.readObject();\n            System.out.println(&quot;Message Received: &quot; + message);\n\n            //\n            // Send a response information to the client application\n            //\n            ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\n            oos.writeObject(&quot;Hi...&quot;);\n\n            ois.close();\n            oos.close();\n            socket.close();\n\n            System.out.println(&quot;Waiting for client message...&quot;);\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass MonitorQueue implements Runnable{\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        //do work when stuff comes in the queue\n        \n    }\n    \n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","maven","javafx"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":4791251,"reputation":151,"user_id":3870391,"display_name":"JN Gerbaux"},"score":0,"creation_date":1633548562,"post_id":66789873,"comment_id":122792035,"body_markdown":"Hello !

you don&#39;t need addScalar\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nIn your example, you don&#39;t really need to use `addScalar`. \r\n\r\nIf you map the response to a DTO, like the following `EmployeeDTO`:\r\n\r\n    public class EmployeeDTO {\r\n\t\tprivate final Long id;\r\n\t\tprivate final String name;\r\n\t\tprivate final Double salary;\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic EmployeeDTO(Long id, String name, Double salary) {\r\n\t\t\tthis.id = id;\r\n\t\t\tthis.name = name;\r\n\t\t\tthis.salary = salary;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic Long getId() {\r\n\t\t\treturn id;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic String

fine:\r\n\r\n    List&lt;EmployeeDTO&gt; employeeDTOs = entityManager.createNativeQuery(&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    \tSELECT\r\n    \t   emp_id AS id,\r\n    \t   emp_name AS name,\r\n    \t   emp_salary AS salary\r\n    \tFROM employee\r\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;)\r\n    .getResultList();\r\n\r\nNotice that we used column aliases so that Hibernate can match the DTO property we want to set.\r\n\r\nWhen you need addScalar\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nAssuming you have a `Book` entity that has a JSON `properties` attribute:\r\n\r\n    @Entity(name = &quot;Book&quot;)\r\n    @Table(name = &quot;book&quot;)\r\n    @TypeDef(typeClass = JsonNodeBinaryType.class, defaultForType = JsonNode.class)\r\n    public static class Book {\r\n\r\n        @Id\r\n        @GeneratedValue\r\n        private Long id;\r\n\r\n        @NaturalId\r\n        private String isbn;\r\n\r\n        @Column(columnDefinition = &quot;jsonb&quot;)\r\n        private JsonNode properties;\r\n\r\n        public Long getId() {\r\n            return id;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void setId(Long id) {\r\n            this.id = id;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public String getIsbn() {\r\n            return isbn;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void setIsbn(String isbn) {\r\n            this.isbn = isbn;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public JsonNode getProperties() {\r\n            return properties;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void setProperties(JsonNode properties) {\r\n            this.properties = properties;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&gt; The `JsonNodeBinaryType` is provided by the [`Hypersistence Utils`](https://github.com/vladmihalcea/hypersistence-utils) open-source project.\r\n\r\nNow, when executing a native SQL query that fetched the JSON `properties` column:\r\n\r\n    JsonNode properties = (JsonNode) entityManagercreateNativeQuery(&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    \tSELECT properties\r\n    \tFROM book\r\n    \tWHERE isbn = :isbn\r\n    \t&quot;&quot;&quot;)\r\n    .setParameter(&quot;isbn&quot;, &quot;978-9730228236&quot;)\r\n    .getSingleResult();\r\n\r\nHibernate throws the following exception:\r\n\r\n    org.hibernate.MappingException: No Dialect mapping for JDBC type: 1111\r\n\r\nThis is because Hibernate does not know how to transform the `jsonb` column to a `JsonNode` Java object since it lacks a Hibernate-native JSON `Type`.\r\n\r\nBut if we call `addScalar` and provide the Hibernate `Type`:\r\n\r\n    JsonNode properties = (JsonNode) entityManager.createNativeQuery(&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    \tSELECT properties\r\n    \tFROM book\r\n    \tWHERE isbn = :isbn\r\n    \t&quot;&quot;&quot;)\r\n    .setParameter(&quot;isbn&quot;, &quot;978-9730228236&quot;)\r\n    .unwrap(org.hibernate.query.NativeQuery.class)\r\n    .addScalar(&quot;properties&quot;, JsonNodeBinaryType.INSTANCE)\r\n    .getSingleResult();\r\n\r\nThen the query will run just fine!","title":"Why

name,\n       emp_salary AS salary\n    FROM employee\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;)\n.getResultList();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that we used column aliases so that Hibernate can match the DTO property we want to set.</p>\n<h2>When you need addScalar</h2>\n<p>Assuming you have a <code>Book</code> entity that has a JSON <code>properties</code> attribute:</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity(name = &quot;Book&quot;)\n@Table(name = &quot;book&quot;)\n@TypeDef(typeClass = JsonNodeBinaryType.class, defaultForType = JsonNode.class)\npublic static class Book {\n\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue\n    private Long id;\n\n    @NaturalId\n    private String isbn;\n\n    @Column(columnDefinition = &quot;jsonb&quot;)\n    private JsonNode properties;\n\n    public Long getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n\n    public void setId(Long id) {\n        this.id = id;\n    }\n\n    public String getIsbn() {\n        return isbn;\n    }\n\n    public void setIsbn(String isbn) {\n        this.isbn = isbn;\n    }\n\n    public JsonNode getProperties() {\n        return properties;\n    }\n\n    public void setProperties(JsonNode properties) {\n        this.properties = properties;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <code>JsonNodeBinaryType</code> is provided by the <a href=\"https://github.com/vladmihalcea/hypersistence-utils\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Hypersistence Utils</code></a> open-source project.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, when executing a native SQL query that fetched the JSON <code>properties</code> column:</p>\n<pre><code>JsonNode properties = (JsonNode) entityManagercreateNativeQuery(&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    SELECT properties\n    FROM book\n    WHERE isbn = :isbn\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;)\n.setParameter(&quot;isbn&quot;, &quot;978-9730228236&quot;)\n.getSingleResult();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Hibernate throws the following exception:</p>\n<pre><code>org.hibernate.MappingException: No Dialect mapping for JDBC type: 1111\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is because Hibernate does not know how to transform the <code>jsonb</code> column to a <code>JsonNode</code> Java object since it lacks a Hibernate-native JSON <code>Type</code>.</p>\n<p>But if we call <code>addScalar</code> and provide the Hibernate <code>Type</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>JsonNode properties = (JsonNode) entityManager.createNativeQuery(&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    SELECT properties\n    FROM book\n    WHERE isbn = :isbn\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;)\n.setParameter(&quot;isbn&quot;, &quot;978-9730228236&quot;)\n.unwrap(org.hibernate.query.NativeQuery.class)\n.addScalar(&quot;properties&quot;, JsonNodeBinaryType.INSTANCE)\n.getSingleResult();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then the query will run just fine!</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":4890996,"reputation":1347,"user_id":3942142,"accept_rate":36,"display_name":"jayendra

But let&#39;s take a closer look: \r\n\r\nIn the worst case, heapify involves moving down each node until it is a leaf node. The cost therefore is the total distance of nodes from the leaves of the tree, or\r\n\r\n    n * h\r\n\r\nwhere `h` is the average distance from a leaf. What is that distance?\r\n\r\nSince a heap is a fully balanced tree, adding a new level of nodes to the tree  adds 1 to the distance of existing nodes, and then adds equally many nodes at distance 0, which halves the average distance:\r\n\r\n    h &lt;- (h + 1) / 2\r\n\r\nTo find what this recurrence relation converges to, we set\r\n\r\n    h = (h + 1) / 2\r\n    \r\nand obtain\r\n\r\n    2h = h + 1\r\n     h = 1\r\n\r\nThat is, the average distance from a leaf in an infinite fully balanced search tree is 1. And that&#39;s why `siftDown`, on average, needs constant time, and `heapify` is linear.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, if we `add()` a node, the following executes:\r\n\r\n    public boolean offer(E e) {\r\n        if (e == null)\r\n            throw new NullPointerException();\r\n        modCount++;\r\n        int i = size;\r\n        if (i &gt;= queue.length)\r\n            grow(i + 1);\r\n        siftUp(i, e);\r\n        size = i + 1;\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n    private void siftUp(int k, E x) {\r\n        if (comparator != null)\r\n            siftUpUsingComparator(k, x, queue, comparator);\r\n        else\r\n            siftUpComparable(k, x, queue);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static &lt;T&gt; void siftUpComparable(int k, T x, Object[] es) {\r\n        Comparable&lt;? super T&gt; key = (Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;) x;\r\n        while (k &gt; 0) {\r\n            int parent = (k - 1) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;\r\n            Object e = es[parent];\r\n            if (key.compareTo((T) e) &gt;= 0)\r\n                break;\r\n            es[k] = e;\r\n            k = parent;\r\n        }\r\n        es[k] = key;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the worst case, `add` moves every node all the way to the root. The overall cost therefore is total distance from the root, i.e. \r\n\r\n    n * d\r\n\r\nwhere d is the average distance from the root. \r\n\r\nTo find the average distance from the root, imaging drawing, from each node, a path to the root. Then, the root node is visited for every node that is not the root, each of the 2 nodes beneath are visited (n-3)/2 times, each of the 4 below (n-7)/4 times, and so on:\r\n\r\n    nd = n * 1/1 + (n-1) * 2/2 + (n-3) * 4/4 + (n-7) * 8/8 + ...\r\n       = n + (n-1) + (n-3) + (n-7) + ... + (n - (n/2 - 1))\r\n       = n * log2(n/2) - (1 + 3 + 7 + ... + (n/2 - 1))\r\n       &gt; n * log2(n/2) - (2 + 4 + 8 + ... + (n/2))\r\n       = n * log2(n/2) - n\r\n       = n * (log2(n) - 2)\r\n\r\nwhich matches what we measured.\r\n\r\nThat is, `heapify` is faster because the average node in a fully balanced binary tree is very close to a leaf, but far from the root.","title":"Building priority queue in linear time","body":"<p>Your test is likely flawed, because the following test shows a clear difference:</p>\n<pre><code>class Counter {\n    int comparisons = 0;\n    \n    class Item implements Comparable&lt;Item&gt; {\n        final int value;\n        \n        Item(int value) {\n            this.value = value;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public int compareTo(Item o) {\n            comparisons++;\n            return value - o.value;\n        }\n        \n        @Override\n        public String toString() {\n            return Integer.toString(value);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Test {\n    static void count(int n) {\n        var c = new Counter();\n        var items = new ArrayList&lt;Counter.Item&gt;();\n        for (int i = n - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\n            items.add(c.new Item(i));\n        }\n        new PriorityQueue&lt;&gt;(items);\n        \n        var c2 = new Counter();\n        var pq2 = new PriorityQueue&lt;&gt;();\n        for (int i = n - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\n            pq2.add(c2.new Item(i));\n        }\n        System.out.println(n + &quot;\\t&quot; + c.comparisons + &quot;\\t&quot; + c2.comparisons);\n    }\n    \n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        for (int i = 1; i &lt; (1 &lt;&lt; 20); i = (i &lt;&lt; 1) | 1) {\n            count(i);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>by printing</p>\n<pre><code>1   0   0\n3   2   2\n7   8   10\n15  22  34\n31  52  98\n63  114 258\n127 240 642\n255 494 1538\n511 1004    3586\n1023    2026    8194\n2047    4072    18434\n4095    8166    40962\n8191    16356   90114\n16383   32738   196610\n32767   65504   425986\n65535   131038  917506\n131071  262108  1966082\n262143  524250  4194306\n524287  1048536 8912898\n1048575 2097110 18874370\n</code></pre>\n<p>That is, while both approaches use a roughly equal number of comparisons for small lists, they scale differently.

And that's why <code>siftDown</code>, on average, needs constant time, and <code>heapify</code> is linear.</p>\n<p>In contrast, if we <code>add()</code> a node, the following executes:</p>\n<pre><code>public boolean offer(E e) {\n    if (e == null)\n        throw new NullPointerException();\n    modCount++;\n    int i = size;\n    if (i &gt;= queue.length)\n        grow(i + 1);\n    siftUp(i, e);\n    size = i + 1;\n    return true;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>where</p>\n<pre><code>private void siftUp(int k, E x) {\n    if (comparator != null)\n        siftUpUsingComparator(k, x, queue, comparator);\n    else\n        siftUpComparable(k, x, queue);\n}\n\nprivate static &lt;T&gt; void siftUpComparable(int k, T x, Object[] es) {\n    Comparable&lt;? super T&gt; key = (Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;) x;\n    while (k &gt; 0) {\n        int parent = (k - 1) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;\n        Object e = es[parent];\n        if (key.compareTo((T) e) &gt;= 0)\n            break;\n        es[k] = e;\n        k = parent;\n    }\n    es[k] = key;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the worst case, <code>add</code> moves every node all the way to the root. The overall cost therefore is total distance from the root, i.e.</p>\n<pre><code>n * d\n</code></pre>\n<p>where d is the average distance from the root.</p>\n<p>To find the average distance from the root, imaging drawing, from each node, a path to the root. Then, the root node is visited for every node that is not the root, each of the 2 nodes beneath are visited (n-3)/2 times, each of the 4 below (n-7)/4 times, and so on:</p>\n<pre><code>nd = n * 1/1 + (n-1) * 2/2 + (n-3) * 4/4 + (n-7) * 8/8 + ...\n   = n + (n-1) + (n-3) + (n-7) + ... + (n - (n/2 - 1))\n   = n * log2(n/2) - (1 + 3 + 7 + ... + (n/2 - 1))\n   &gt; n * log2(n/2) - (2 + 4 + 8 + ... + (n/2))\n   = n * log2(n/2) - n\n   = n * (log2(n) - 2)\n</code></pre>\n<p>which matches what we measured.</p>\n<p>That is, <code>heapify</code> is faster because the average node in a fully balanced binary tree is very close to a leaf, but far from the root.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":28104565,"reputation":107,"user_id":21473368,"display_name":"nick"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":103,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1685741684,"creation_date":1685464179,"question_id":76366868,"body_markdown":"There are two ways to build a priority queue:  \r\n\r\n```\r\n// 1.\r\nPriorityQueue&lt;Integer&gt; pq = new PriorityQueue&lt;&gt;();  \r\npq.addAll(collection);  \r\n\r\n// 2.\r\nPriorityQueue&lt;Integer&gt; pq = new PriorityQueue&lt;&gt;(collection);\r\n```\r\n\r\n - Approach #1 uses the `addAll` method to add each element one by one to the priority queue, so there will be `n` iterations (size of the collection) of the for-loop; and for each iteration there will be a siftUp operation which could take O(log n) time in the worst case.
