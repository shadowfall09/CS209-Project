Drivers obtained through Microsoft (if you're using Windows) typically do not support OpenGL, so you want to download the latest driver from the manufacturer.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":361327,"reputation":12478,"user_id":703851,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Vaibhav Jani"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":18521,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":14,"accepted_answer_id":12518246,"answer_count":2,"score":14,"last_activity_date":1658238301,"creation_date":1309946497,"question_id":6594636,"body_markdown":"This is my simple Camera Intent Demo in which i have only one Activity .....\r\n\r\n    package x.y;\r\n    \r\n    import android.app.Activity;\r\n    import android.content.Intent;\r\n    import android.graphics.Bitmap;\r\n    import android.os.Bundle;\r\n    import android.widget.ImageView;\r\n    public class PhotoShoot extends Activity {\r\n    \tfinal static int CAMERA_RESULT = 0;\r\n    \tImageView imv;\r\n    \t@Override\r\n    \tpublic void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\r\n    \t\tsuper.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\r\n    \t\tsetContentView(R.layout.main);\r\n    \t\tIntent i = new Intent(android.provider.MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE);\r\n    \t\tstartActivityForResult(i, CAMERA_RESULT);\r\n    \t}\r\n    \tprotected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent intent) {\r\n    \t\tsuper.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, intent);\r\n    \t\tif (resultCode == RESULT_OK)\r\n    \t\t{\r\n    \t\t\tBundle extras = intent.getExtras();\r\n    \t\t\tBitmap bmp = (Bitmap) extras.get(&quot;data&quot;);\r\n    \t\t\timv = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.ReturnedImageView);\r\n    \t\t\timv.setImageBitmap(bmp);\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd Layout main.xml\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

Thanks!\r\n\r\nNote: I also found [this][3] question, so I added &quot;{transitive=true}&quot; at the end of the dependency implementation line and it worked.\r\n\r\nSo now to include my library successfully, the dependency must be coded as:\r\n\r\n    implementation (group: &#39;com.mygroup&#39;, name: &#39;my_library&#39;, version: &#39;1.3&#39;, ext: &#39;aar&#39;, classifier: &#39;release&#39;) { transitive=true changing=true }\r\n\r\n(I included &quot;changing=true&quot; to force it to re-download the library every time.)\r\n\r\nIf I don&#39;t include &quot;transitive=true&quot;, I get the following errors:\r\n\r\n        02-04 20:11:48.462 10225-10225/com.mydomain.app.testapplication4 E/dalvikvm: Could not find class &#39;android.graphics.drawable.RippleDrawable&#39;, referenced from method android.support.v7.widget.AppCompatImageHelper.hasOverlappingRendering\r\n        02-04 20:14:07.080 10225-10225/com.mydomain.app.testapplication4 E/dalvikvm: Could not find class &#39;android.app.NotificationChannel&#39;, referenced from method com.mydomain.library.mydomain$1.onReceive\r\n        02-04 20:14:07.290 10225-10225/com.mydomain.app.testapplication4 E/AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: main\r\n            java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com.google.firebase.iid.FirebaseInstanceId\r\n                at com.mydomain.library.MyActivity.onCreate(MyActivity.java:88)\r\n                at android.app.Activity.performCreate(Activity.java:4701)\r\n                at android.app.Instrumentation.callActivityOnCreate(Instrumentation.java:1051)\r\n                at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:1924)\r\n                at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivity(ActivityThread.java:1985)\r\n                at android.app.ActivityThread.access$600(ActivityThread.java:127)\r\n                at android.app.ActivityThread$H.handleMessage(ActivityThread.java:1151)\r\n                at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99)\r\n                at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:137)\r\n                at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:4477)\r\n                at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNative(Native Method)\r\n                at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:511)\r\n                at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:788)\r\n                at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:555)\r\n                at dalvik.system.NativeStart.main(Native Method)\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the latest script I used to publish the library (note that it only publishes the release build, but the dependency line still requires the &quot;release&quot;

And where is that? Who knows!\r\n\r\nWhomever wrote that code messed up. It&#39;s not a good idea to use the CWD for _anything_ in _any_ java code unless you specifically know you want it. And generally, that&#39;s only the case when you&#39;re writing command line tools in the vein of the various tools you find in your average linux distro&#39;s `/bin` dir - a rare occurrence, given that the JVM isn&#39;t really designed for that kind of thing.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 different best practices for &#39;data files&#39; depending on the nature of the data:\r\n\r\n* Static, unchanging data - as much part of your app as your class files are. These should be loaded with `MyClass.class.getResource(&quot;name-of-resource.txt&quot;)` and shipped the same way your classes are. For example, _inside_ the jar file.\r\n\r\n* Config files. These should usually be in `System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;)` - the user&#39;s home dir; `/Users/yourusername` on macs, `/home/yourusername` on linux, `C:\\Users\\YourUserName` on windows. Best practice is to ship a &#39;template&#39; version of the settings file if relevant in the jar file, and upon detecting that there is no config file present at all, to write out the template (and you load the template in via `MyClass.class.getResource`). If a template is not a good idea, something in a similar vein. Bad practice is to have the installer do this, and have your app be broken or leave the user having to peruse complex documentation to (re)create the config file. A different way to do it right is to have a config page in your app (a window, menu bar setting, web app thing - something with a user interface) where you can change settings and the config file is simply the way you store that data.\r\n\r\n* Changing data files. For example, you ship H2 (an all-java database engine) with your app and it needs to write its database file somewhere. This is a bit tricky; user home is not the right place for such data files, but you can&#39;t really &#39;find&#39; the dir where your app is installed either. Even if you can, on non-badly-designed OSes, apps usually cannot (and should not!) be able to write to that location anyway. The location where this data is stored should definitely be configurable, so one easy way out is to _require_ that the user explicitly picks a place. Otherwise I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re stuck having to write per-OS code - find `/Users/myusername/Library/Application Support/yourappname` on mac, which is the right place. As far as I know there is no library to do this right.\r\n\r\nNone of them involve &#39;require that the user start the app with the right CWD&#39;. There are good reasons for that: It can be hard to configure, and it&#39;s not something users think of _to_ configure. For example, when setting up a java app as a recurring task in windows, you _can_ configure the working dir for such a process, but it&#39;s not something that&#39;s usually considered as crucial configuration. When running a java app from the command line, who knows what the working dir is. You&#39;ll end up with an app that usually works, except in some circumstances when it magically doesn&#39;t, and most of your users have no idea that the difference between the magic run that works and the one that does not, is the directory they were in when they started the java app.\r\n\r\nIf you can edit that code, do so - figure out which of the 3 different kinds of data this is about (sounds like the second bullet: Config stuff, so should be in user home, and the app&#39;s name should be part of the file name) - and fix it. for example, that should be:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry (var in = Files.newBufferedReader(Paths.get(System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;), &quot;myapp-mail.conf&quot;)) {\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis solves a whole bunch of problems:\r\n\r\n* Uses try-with to avoid resource leakage.\r\n* Reads from user.home, avoiding current working directory as relevant setting.\r\n* Actually uses UTF-8 encoding (whereas your code will, at least until java 17, do &#39;platform default&#39;.

You can&#39;t throw checked exceptions in a `java.function.Consumer` specifically, because its signature \r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid accept(T t);\r\n```\r\n\r\ndoesn&#39;t declare any.\r\n\r\nThe following functional interface is perfectly acceptable, and can throw certain checked exceptions.\r\n\r\n    public interface MyMessageHandler {\r\n        void accept(IncomingMessage incomingMessage) throws IOException;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    MyMessageHandler handler = (msg) -&gt; {\r\n        throw new IOException(); // Valid\r\n    };\r\n\r\nIf you wanted something more generic, you could declare something like\r\n\r\n    public interface ThrowableConsumer&lt;T&gt; {\r\n        void accept(T t) throws Exception;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    interface MyMessageHandler extends ThrowableConsumer&lt;MyMessage&gt; {}\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; I am throwing the exceptions at this level of the stack, as I want to\r\n&gt; implement the actual handling behaviour higher up the stack\r\n\r\nYou could use Lombok&#39;s [`@SneakyThrows`](https://projectlombok.org/features/SneakyThrows) to effectively convert a checked exception into an unchecked one. A hack, but it works.\r\n\r\n    class SpecificMessageHandler implements MyMessageHandler {\r\n        @Override\r\n        @SneakyThrows\r\n        public void accept(IncomingMessage incomingMessage) {\r\n            // Doesn&#39;t matter that it&#39;s checked and j.f.Consumer doesn&#39;t declare it\r\n            throw new IOException(); \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHowever I highly doubt that your employer will allow you to do hacks like this if you&#39;re not permitted to change an interface.\r\n\r\n&gt; This functionally works, however feels like bad design\r\n\r\nWhy? There&#39;s a huge class of people who believe that checked exceptions were a mistake to begin with.
