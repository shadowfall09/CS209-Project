Instead it should be returned, which also means there is no reason to have a `while` loop at all. This is the decision to take here: either have a loop and no recursion, or have no loop, and use recursion.\r\n\r\n### Correction\r\n\r\nTo stick with your idea, you could correct by turning the `while` into an `if`, and returning the value that comes from the recursive call:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public static int findNthElemFromEnd(Node firstNode, int positionFromEnd) {\r\n        Node tempNode = firstNode;\r\n        \r\n        if (tempNode.next != null) {\r\n            loopCounter = loopCounter + 1;\r\n            \r\n            if(loopCounter &gt; (positionFromEnd - 1)) {\r\n                linkedList = linkedList.next;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            return findNthElemFromEnd(tempNode.next, positionFromEnd); \r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        return linkedList.data; // base case\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some downsides to this solution:\r\n\r\n* The function relies on side-effects: `linkedList` and `loopCounter` are non local variables which this function updates. That means if you want to use that function again, you need to first reset those variables. That is not a nice pattern. It would be better to solve this with local variables only.\r\n\r\n* Recursion costs stack space, and therefor this function puts a limit on the size of the linked list, as for bigger lists, this function will run into a stack overflow.\r\n\r\n* It doesn&#39;t work when the list is empty (exception will be raised). It should check whether `firstNode` is `null` and act accordingly.\r\n\r\n* It doesn&#39;t give the correct result when the value of `positionFromEnd` is greater than the size of the list. It should then not return the first node of the list, but better `null`.\r\n\r\nThe *iterative* solution is also to have two node references that are as many nodes apart as you want to stay away from the end of the list. In the first iterations of the loop the reference at the front gets to walk ahead with the required number of steps. In the rest of the iterations both references walk in tandem until the first one hits the end of the list.\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public static int findNthElemFromEnd(Node firstNode, int positionFromEnd) {\r\n        Node frontNode = firstNode;\r\n        Node backNode = firstNode;\r\n        while (frontNode != null) {\r\n            frontNode = frontNode.next;\r\n            positionFromEnd--;\r\n            if (positionFromEnd &lt; 0) backNode = backNode.next;\r\n        }\r\n        if (positionFromEnd &gt; 0) return null; // List is too short\r\n        return frontNode.data;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n","title":"Linked list execution clarification","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>why it executes the function once again after return statement is called.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is because the recursive function call happens within a <code>while</code> loop, and the condition of the <code>while</code> loop has not changed, so it will loop again, and make the recursive call again.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am able to get the 3rd element from the end of the linked list as expected.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The value that is returned by the recursive call is ignored.

It would be better to solve this with local variables only.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Recursion costs stack space, and therefor this function puts a limit on the size of the linked list, as for bigger lists, this function will run into a stack overflow.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It doesn't work when the list is empty (exception will be raised). It should check whether <code>firstNode</code> is <code>null</code> and act accordingly.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It doesn't give the correct result when the value of <code>positionFromEnd</code> is greater than the size of the list. It should then not return the first node of the list, but better <code>null</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <em>iterative</em> solution is also to have two node references that are as many nodes apart as you want to stay away from the end of the list. In the first iterations of the loop the reference at the front gets to walk ahead with the required number of steps. In the rest of the iterations both references walk in tandem until the first one hits the end of the list.</p>\n<p>Implementation:</p>\n<pre><code>    public static int findNthElemFromEnd(Node firstNode, int positionFromEnd) {\n        Node frontNode = firstNode;\n        Node backNode = firstNode;\n        while (frontNode != null) {\n            frontNode = frontNode.next;\n            positionFromEnd--;\n            if (positionFromEnd &lt; 0) backNode = backNode.next;\n        }\n        if (positionFromEnd &gt; 0) return null; // List is too short\n        return frontNode.data;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":3799294,"reputation":25,"user_id":3153356,"display_name":"user3153356"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1661373557,"creation_date":1661345544,"question_id":73473532,"body_markdown":"I am facing an weird issue while executing a linked list code.

These are the ones that convert Java Objects from and to JSON/XML\r\n - By default, Spring boot will add the following converters:\r\n    1. ByteArrayHttpMessageConverter\r\n    2. StringHttpMessageConverter\r\n    3. ResourceHttpMessageConverter\r\n    4. SourceHttpMessageConverter\r\n    5. FormHttpMessageConverter\r\n    6.

MappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter\r\n    8. **MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter**\r\n- So, whenever we are converting the java object into JSON, then spring will go through this list of converters one by one in order and picks the relevant one to convert\r\n- Now, if we add our custom MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter to this list as the last element, then spring will not come to it because before reaching our converter(9th element), there is the default converter at the 7th index\r\n- So, to resolve this issue, **we need to remove the default MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverte and need to add our custom converter**\r\n\r\n\r\n```@Configuration\r\n@EnableWebMvc\r\npublic class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void extendMessageConverters(List&lt;HttpMessageConverter&lt;?&gt;&gt;

Thanks in Advance.</p>\n<p>KieSession - Is the runtime inferer between the rules and the data.</p>\n<p>Kiebase - Is a collection of rules belonging to a same context and can contain multiple kiesessions.</p>\n<p>Kiemodule - Is a collection of KieBases and is placed under kmodule.xml.</p>\n<p>Kiecontainer - Is a container holding all of the above.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","maven","jpa"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":21994,"reputation":73798,"user_id":53897,"accept_rate":56,"display_name":"Thorbj&#248;rn Ravn Andersen"},"score":0,"creation_date":1661355043,"post_id":73475796,"comment_id":129754048,"body_markdown":"Each module needs to know it’s parent, it is not enough for the parent to know it’s modules.","body":"Each module needs to know it’s parent, it is not enough for the parent to know it’s modules."},{"owner":{"account_id":11899869,"reputation":580,"user_id":8797900,"display_name":"gromyk"},"score":0,"creation_date":1661355781,"post_id":73475796,"comment_id":129754351,"body_markdown":"@Thorbj&#248;rnRavnAndersen they do, but still the application crashes, cause it can&#39;t find the properties.","body":"@Thorbj&#248;rnRavnAndersen they do, but still the application crashes, cause it can&#39;t find the properties."},{"owner":{"account_id":21994,"reputation":73798,"user_id":53897,"accept_rate":56,"display_name":"Thorbj&#248;rn Ravn Andersen"},"score":0,"creation_date":1661355997,"post_id":73475796,"comment_id":129754439,"body_markdown":"Parent modules do not create jars so you need to put property files somewhere else.","body":"Parent modules do not create jars so you need to put property files somewhere else."}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4181375,"reputation":5091,"user_id":3426309,"display_name":"Andrey B.
