I took an example from [Soteria](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/soteria/tree/master/test/app-mem-customform) (as I understand, the reference implementation for Jakarta Security) and created a new Jakarta EE project to deploy on my application servers. The code is available [here](https://github.com/vitorsouza/jakarta-security-example).\r\n\r\nThe example includes a very simple identity store for a user `reza` with password `secret1`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@ApplicationScoped\r\npublic class TestIdentityStore implements IdentityStore {\r\n    public CredentialValidationResult validate(UsernamePasswordCredential usernamePasswordCredential) {\r\n\r\n        if (usernamePasswordCredential.compareTo(&quot;reza&quot;, &quot;secret1&quot;)) {\r\n            return new CredentialValidationResult(&quot;reza&quot;, new HashSet&lt;&gt;(asList(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)));\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return INVALID_RESULT;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA servlet contains the custom form authentication mechanism definition that redirects the user to `/login.jsf` if she&#39;s not authenticated. When authenticated, it displays the user name (principal name) and tests the user roles.

dealing with the form and calling the Jakarta Securty API to perform authentication:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Named\r\n@RequestScoped\r\npublic class LoginBacking {\r\n    @Inject\r\n    private

context = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();\r\n        Credential credential = new UsernamePasswordCredential(username, new Password(password));\r\n        \r\n        AuthenticationStatus status = securityContext.authenticate(\r\n            getRequest(context),\r\n            getResponse(context), \r\n            withParams().credential(credential));\r\n        \r\n        if (status.equals(SEND_CONTINUE)) {\r\n            // Authentication mechanism has send a redirect, should not\r\n            // send anything to response from JSF now.\r\n            context.responseComplete();\r\n        } else if (status.equals(SEND_FAILURE)) {\r\n            addError(context, &quot;Authentication failed&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n

Thanks!","title":"Why does this simple Jakarta Security example from Soteria work on Payara but not on WildFly?","body":"<p>I'm used to using WildFly for Java/Jakarta EE development and lately I wanted to update a project that is using JAAS for authentication/authorization to the new Jakarta Security API from Jakarta EE 9.1.</p>\n<p>I couldn't make it work, so I decided to create the simplest example possible and experiment on different application servers. I took an example from <a href=\"https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/soteria/tree/master/test/app-mem-customform\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soteria</a> (as I understand, the reference implementation for Jakarta Security) and created a new Jakarta EE project to deploy on my application servers. The code is available <a href=\"https://github.com/vitorsouza/jakarta-security-example\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The example includes a very simple identity store for a user <code>reza</code> with password <code>secret1</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@ApplicationScoped\npublic class TestIdentityStore implements IdentityStore {\n    public CredentialValidationResult validate(UsernamePasswordCredential usernamePasswordCredential) {\n\n        if (usernamePasswordCredential.compareTo(&quot;reza&quot;, &quot;secret1&quot;)) {\n            return new CredentialValidationResult(&quot;reza&quot;, new HashSet&lt;&gt;(asList(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)));\n        }\n\n        return INVALID_RESULT;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>A servlet contains the custom form authentication mechanism definition that redirects the user to <code>/login.jsf</code> if she's not authenticated.

These are not the same thing. Your OS can run applications. The terminal isn&#39;t &quot;the OS&quot;. It&#39;s an application. When you type stuff in there, you are not sending it &#39;to the system&#39;, you&#39;re just typing in that application. No different from me typing in this very text box in a web browser. I type a letter and it appears. I hit enter and stuff happens.\r\n\r\nThe shell does a whole boatload of &#39;parsing&#39; on what you type and then uses the equivalent of `Runtime.getRuntime().exec` in the language it is written in.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of things that `/bin/bash`, `/bin/zsh`, `/bin/fish`, windows&#39;s `cmd.exe`, and all those other shells do. For some of these, it really IS the OS that does it... depending on which OS you&#39;re using. It&#39;s best to __rely on absolutely none of these__:\r\n\r\n* Scour the PATH when you type a non-absolute-path executable to know which one to run.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n* Append `.exe`, `.bat`, `.com`, or similar.\r\n* A whole bunch of well known commands like `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, etcetera.\r\n* `&amp;&amp;`, `||` and other ways to chain things.\r\n* filename substitutions, such as `whatever.exe *.txt` (the *.txt is &#39;substitution&#39;).&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, same goes for `?`.\r\n* variable substitution, such as `/bin/foo $fn`.\r\n* Redirect pipes such as `2&gt;/dev/null` or `&lt;myfile.txt`.\r\n* splitting the command up by separating on spaces and considering the first thing the path of a command and all other things, each individually, a single argument... but then looking at quotes, using those to figure out certain spaces are _not_ separators between parameters, and removing the actual quote characters of course.\r\n* Replace `~` with the user&#39;s home dir.\r\n* And much, much more.\r\n\r\nYou need to do __all of it__ yourself. That&#39;s why you should never use `Runtime.getRuntime().exec` and always use [`ProcessBuilder`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/ProcessBuilder.html) instead. You can set up redirects with that, do the argument splitting on your own. Always specify an absolute path.

These are not the same thing. Your OS can run applications. The terminal isn't &quot;the OS&quot;. It's an application. When you type stuff in there, you are not sending it 'to the system', you're just typing in that application. No different from me typing in this very text box in a web browser. I type a letter and it appears. I hit enter and stuff happens.</p>\n<p>The shell does a whole boatload of 'parsing' on what you type and then uses the equivalent of <code>Runtime.getRuntime().exec</code> in the language it is written in.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of things that <code>/bin/bash</code>, <code>/bin/zsh</code>, <code>/bin/fish</code>, windows's <code>cmd.exe</code>, and all those other shells do. For some of these, it really IS the OS that does it... depending on which OS you're using. It's best to <strong>rely on absolutely none of these</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scour the PATH when you type a non-absolute-path executable to know which one to run.<sup>2</sup></li>\n<li>Append <code>.exe</code>, <code>.bat</code>, <code>.com</code>, or similar.</li>\n<li>A whole bunch of well known commands like <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, etcetera.</li>\n<li><code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code> and other ways to chain things.</li>\n<li>filename substitutions, such as <code>whatever.exe *.txt</code> (the *.txt is 'substitution').<sup>1</sup>, same goes for <code>?</code>.</li>\n<li>variable substitution, such as <code>/bin/foo $fn</code>.</li>\n<li>Redirect pipes such as <code>2&gt;/dev/null</code> or <code>&lt;myfile.txt</code>.</li>\n<li>splitting the command up by separating on spaces and considering the first thing the path of a command and all other things, each individually, a single argument... but then looking at quotes, using those to figure out certain spaces are <em>not</em> separators between parameters, and removing the actual quote characters of course.</li>\n<li>Replace <code>~</code> with the user's home dir.</li>\n<li>And much, much more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You need to do <strong>all of it</strong> yourself. That's why you should never use <code>Runtime.getRuntime().exec</code> and always use <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/ProcessBuilder.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>ProcessBuilder</code></a> instead.

If a thread-safe highly-concurrent implementation is desired, then it is recommended to use [`ConcurrentHashMap`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html) in place of Hashtable.\n\n**Whatever you do, do not use `clone()`,** it is not secure and not performant.

If it&#39;s purely a defensive copy, **and it&#39;s immutable**, I would recommend using [`Map&lt;String, String&gt; map = ImmutableMap.copyOf(properties)`](http://google.github.io/guava/releases/snapshot/api/docs/com/google/common/collect/ImmutableMap.html). Note: again, this doesn&#39;t use an actual `Properties` object because `Hashtable` is not recommended unless you need it. From [the wiki](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/ImmutableCollectionsExplained) \n\n&gt; When you don&#39;t expect to modify a collection, or expect a collection to remain constant, it&#39;s a good practice to defensively copy it into an immutable collection.\n&gt;\n&gt; Important: Each of the Guava immutable collection implementations rejects null values. We did an exhaustive study on Google&#39;s internal code base that indicated that null elements were allowed in collections about 5% of the time, and the other 95% of cases were best served by failing fast on nulls. If you need to use null values, consider using Collections.unmodifiableList and its friends on a collection implementation that permits null.

If a thread-safe implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>HashMap</code></a> in place of <code>Hashtable</code>. If a thread-safe highly-concurrent implementation is desired, then it is recommended to use <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>ConcurrentHashMap</code></a> in place of Hashtable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Whatever you do, do not use <code>clone()</code>,</strong> it is not secure and not performant. See: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/29528850/1768232\">Java: Why shouldn&#39;t clone() be used for defensive copying?</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>You edited your question to ask about Guava and apache-commons. If it's purely a defensive copy, <strong>and it's immutable</strong>, I would recommend using <a href=\"http://google.github.io/guava/releases/snapshot/api/docs/com/google/common/collect/ImmutableMap.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>Map&lt;String, String&gt; map = ImmutableMap.copyOf(properties)</code></a>. Note: again, this doesn't use an actual <code>Properties</code> object because <code>Hashtable</code> is not recommended unless you need it. From <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/ImmutableCollectionsExplained\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the wiki</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you don't expect to modify a collection, or expect a collection to remain constant, it's a good practice to defensively copy it into an immutable collection.</p>\n<p>Important: Each of the Guava immutable collection implementations rejects null values. We did an exhaustive study on Google's internal code base that indicated that null elements were allowed in collections about 5% of the time, and the other 95% of cases were best served by failing fast on nulls. If you need to use null values, consider using Collections.unmodifiableList and its friends on a collection implementation that permits null. More detailed suggestions can be found here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":464810,"reputation":2023,"user_id":868540,"accept_rate":72,"display_name":"Pumphouse"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1438893503,"creation_date":1438892026,"answer_id":31864946,"question_id":31864727,"body_markdown":"Properties implements Cloneable, so it looks like you could do the following if you wanted. \r\n\r\n\r\n    this.properties = (Properties) properties.clone();\r\n\r\nadd this to your class\r\n\r\n    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {\r\n        return super.clone();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOr if you&#39;re worried about using clone, your class also implements serializable, so you could do this. \r\n\r\n    import org.apache.commons.lang.SerializationUtils;\r\n    \r\n    this.properties = SerializationUtils.clone(properties);\r\n\r\n[Properies][1]\r\n\r\n[Cloneable][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html\r\n  [2]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Cloneable.html\r\n","title":"How do I make a copy of java.util.Properties object?","body":"<p>Properties implements Cloneable, so it looks like you could do the following if you wanted. </p>\n\n<pre><code>this.properties = (Properties) properties.clone();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>add this to your class</p>\n\n<pre><code>protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {\n    return super.clone();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or if you're worried about using clone, your class also implements serializable, so you could do this. </p>\n\n<pre><code>import org.apache.commons.lang.SerializationUtils;\n\nthis.properties = SerializationUtils.clone(properties);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Properies</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Cloneable.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cloneable</a></p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":5621346,"reputation":629,"user_id":4451076,"display_name":"Scott Schechter"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1438897586,"creation_date":1438897586,"answer_id":31866358,"question_id":31864727,"body_markdown":"Or you can just do it the &quot;long&quot; way:\r\n\r\n        Iterator i = properties.keySet().iterator();\r\n        while(i.hasNext()){\r\n            this.properties.put(i.next(), properties.get(i));\r\n        }\r\n\r\nIterator is from the same java.util package as Properties, so no outside dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf the compiler warning about unchecked types bothers you, you can simply change it to (assuming your property keys are strings):\r\n\r\n        Iterator&lt;Object&gt; i = properties.keySet().iterator();\r\n        while(i.hasNext()){\r\n            this.properties.put(i.next().toString(), properties.get(i));\r\n        }","title":"How do I make a copy of java.util.Properties object?","body":"<p>Or you can just do it the \"long\" way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Iterator i = properties.keySet().iterator();\n    while(i.hasNext()){\n        this.properties.put(i.next(), properties.get(i));\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Iterator is from the same java.util package as Properties, so no outside dependencies.</p>\n\n<p>If the compiler warning about unchecked types bothers you, you can simply change it to (assuming your property keys are strings):</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Iterator&lt;Object&gt; i = properties.keySet().iterator();\n    while(i.hasNext()){\n        this.properties.put(i.next().toString(), properties.get(i));\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1088201,"reputation":4958,"user_id":1083428,"display_name":"Pavel Evstigneev"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1502170942,"creation_date":1502167536,"answer_id":45559455,"question_id":31864727,"body_markdown":"Try this:\r\n\r\n    Properties newProps = new Properties();\r\n    properties.forEach((key, value) -&gt; {\r\n        newProps.setProperty((String) key, (String) value);\r\n    });","title":"How do I make a copy of java.util.Properties object?","body":"<p>Try this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Properties newProps = new Properties();\nproperties.forEach((key, value) -&gt; {\n    newProps.setProperty((String) key, (String) value);\n});\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3511610,"reputation":3120,"user_id":2935802,"display_name":"Sudhakar"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1563882896,"creation_date":1563882896,"answer_id":57163691,"question_id":31864727,"body_markdown":"The below program copies the one property file to another and will remove the duplicates also.

I am running into an issue where port scrapers among other entities connecting will delay the handshake and cause latency for anyone registered on OP_READ. My solution was to handle OP_READ &amp; OP_ACCEPT on separate threads but I have been having issues.

So that might make it better to convert to upper case.  You're using lower case 'ss' in your match string.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1361789,"reputation":2778,"user_id":1299008,"accept_rate":42,"display_name":"Hoobajoob"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":94,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1638810013,"creation_date":1638807850,"question_id":70248597,"body_markdown":"Assuming these string definitions:\r\n```java\r\nString lowerStream = &quot;ﬂü&#223;chen&quot;;\r\nString upperStream = &quot;FL&#220;SSCHEN&quot;;\r\nString streamPattern = &quot;.*(ss).*&quot;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing this pattern:\r\n```java\r\nPattern pattern = Pattern.compile(streamPattern, Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE | Pattern.UNICODE_CASE);\r\n```\r\n\r\n...this assertion passes:\r\n```java\r\nassertThat( pattern.matcher(upperStream).find() ).isTrue()\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and this one fails:\r\n```java\r\nassertThat( pattern.matcher(lowerStream).find() ).isTrue()\r\n```\r\n\r\n...whereas *both* `lowerStream` and `upperStream` pass on [rubular.com][1] with each of these regexes:\r\n\r\n`/.*(ss).*/i`\r\n\r\n`/.*(SS).*/i`\r\n\r\n`/.*(&#223;).*/i`\r\n\r\nIt is also not possible to get a successful comparison using any of `String.equalsIgnoreCase()`, `String.toLowerCase().equals()`, or `String.toUpperCase().equals()`.\r\n\r\nDoes java&#39;s unicode regex only support simple case folding?
