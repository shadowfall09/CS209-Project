It is strongly recommended, though, to limit the number of fonts to one, and to the smallest possible number if one is not possible.</p>\n<p>So here we basically create a <code>PdfFormXObject</code> which serves as our appearance object:</p>\n<pre><code>FontSet fontSet = new FontSet();\nfontSet.addFont(&quot;C:/Windows/Fonts/arial.ttf&quot;);\nFontProvider fontProvider = new FontProvider(fontSet);\n\nPdfFormXObject xObject = new PdfFormXObject(FIELDRECT);\nCanvas canvas = new Canvas(xObject, pdfDoc);\ncanvas.setProperty(Property.FONT_PROVIDER, fontProvider);\ncanvas.add(new Paragraph(FIELDVALUE).setMultipliedLeading(1).setFontFamily(&quot;Arial&quot;));\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then we have to set it to the field:</p>\n<pre><code>ff.setAppearance(PdfName.N, null, xObject.getPdfObject());\n</code></pre>\n<p>Full code of your <code>createPdf</code> now looks as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>PdfWriter writer = new PdfWriter(dest);\nPdfDocument pdfDoc = new PdfDocument(writer);\nDocument doc = new Document(pdfDoc);\n\nParagraph para = new Paragraph(&quot;Test document for multi-font appearance in a text formfield&quot;);\ndoc.add(para);\n\nPdfAcroForm acroForm = PdfAcroForm.getAcroForm(pdfDoc,true);\nPdfTextFormField ff = PdfFormField.createText(pdfDoc,FIELDRECT,&quot;test&quot;, FIELDVALUE);\nff.setMultiline(true);\nff.setScroll(true);\n\nFontSet fontSet = new FontSet();\nfontSet.addFont(&quot;C:/Windows/Fonts/arial.ttf&quot;);\nFontProvider fontProvider = new FontProvider(fontSet);\n\nPdfFormXObject xObject = new PdfFormXObject(FIELDRECT);\nCanvas canvas = new Canvas(xObject, pdfDoc);\ncanvas.setProperty(Property.FONT_PROVIDER, fontProvider);\ncanvas.add(new Paragraph(FIELDVALUE).setMultipliedLeading(1).setFontFamily(&quot;Arial&quot;));\n\nff.setAppearance(PdfName.N, null, xObject.getPdfObject());\n\nacroForm.addField(ff,pdfDoc.getFirstPage());\n\nPdfCanvas pdfCanvas = new PdfCanvas(pdfDoc.getFirstPage());\npdfCanvas.setLineWidth(1f).setStrokeColor(ColorConstants.BLUE).rectangle(FIELDRECT).stroke();\n\ndoc.close();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Visual result on opening the PDF:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kku3X.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kku3X.png\" alt=\"result\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>UPD</strong> The code above works fine in Adobe Acrobat, Foxit, Chrome PDF viewer but when you open it up in Adobe Reader you see empty form field.</p>\n<p>To make it work in Acrobat, you have to make sure to have your XObject bbox start at origin:</p>\n<pre><code>PdfFormXObject xObject = new PdfFormXObject(new Rectangle(0, 0, FIELDRECT.getWidth(), FIELDRECT.getHeight()));\n</code></pre>\n<p>And also wrap the appearance into <code>/Tx BMC</code> / <code>EMC</code> block which marks the part that need to be replaced when appearance is regenerated.</p>\n<p>Fixed part of code produces correct result in Adobe Acrobat Reader as well:</p>\n<pre><code>PdfFormXObject xObject = new PdfFormXObject(new Rectangle(0, 0, FIELDRECT.getWidth(), FIELDRECT.getHeight()));\nCanvas canvas = new Canvas(xObject, pdfDoc);\ncanvas.getPdfCanvas().beginMarkedContent(new PdfName(&quot;Tx&quot;));\ncanvas.setProperty(Property.FONT_PROVIDER, fontProvider);\ncanvas.add(new Paragraph(FIELDVALUE).setMultipliedLeading(1).setFontFamily(&quot;Arial&quot;));\ncanvas.getPdfCanvas().endMarkedContent();\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":14961660,"reputation":1403,"user_id":10801227,"display_name":"John"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":268,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":69144156,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1634841779,"creation_date":1630669683,"question_id":69044414,"body_markdown":"I create a PDF document with text fillable fields using ```itext 7.1.9``` library.

I have another piece of code that does exactly the same thing and never gave any trouble. It goes sorta like this:\r\n\r\n    public class A {\r\n\r\n        public class B {\r\n\r\n            public byte x;\r\n\r\n            public B(DataInput in) throws IOException {\r\n                x = in.readByte();\r\n                if (Utility.get(x, 7)) {\r\n                    y = in.readInt();\r\n                    ...\r\n                    etc.\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow with the new code the utility method mostly returns true but sometimes false for the same arguments (when printed these are b=-124 and bit=7). I checked that no other Threads are accessing the byte member variable that is passed as &#39;b&#39; (shouldn&#39;t be possible anyway since all of this happens in the class&#39; constructor). Also if I print out the passed value for &#39;b&#39; in the utility method (for example) the issue goes away. It seems to be timing related (that&#39;s why I thought of Threads).\r\n\r\nAfter reading up I realized that (b &amp; 0b10000000) cast as a byte is -128 but (b &amp; 0b10000000) cast as an int is 128.

I have another piece of code that does exactly the same thing and never gave any trouble. It goes sorta like this:</p>\n<pre><code>public class A {\n\n    public class B {\n\n        public byte x;\n\n        public B(DataInput in) throws IOException {\n            x = in.readByte();\n            if (Utility.get(x, 7)) {\n                y = in.readInt();\n                ...\n                etc.\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now with the new code the utility method mostly returns true but sometimes false for the same arguments (when printed these are b=-124 and bit=7). I checked that no other Threads are accessing the byte member variable that is passed as 'b' (shouldn't be possible anyway since all of this happens in the class' constructor). Also if I print out the passed value for 'b' in the utility method (for example) the issue goes away.

is a 2 argument `groupingBy` method - the second argument is a `Collector` that is applied to the value (a `List`) associated to each key.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s do it step-by-step.\r\n\r\nAssuming `import static java.util.stream.Collectors.*;`  \r\nand that we have the list:\r\n````\r\nList&lt;Item&gt; list = List.of(\r\n  new Item(&quot;A&quot;, 1, 100, &quot;ABC&quot;),\r\n  new Item(&quot;B&quot;, 2, 200, &quot;ABC&quot;),\r\n  new Item(&quot;A&quot;, 3, 300, &quot;ABC&quot;),\r\n  new Item(&quot;B&quot;, 2, 200, &quot;PQR&quot;),\r\n  new Item(&quot;B&quot;, 2, 200, &quot;PQR&quot;),\r\n  new Item(&quot;A&quot;, 2, 200, &quot;PQR&quot;));\r\n````\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n- First step: group by `txnId` as already in question:\r\n````\r\nlist.stream().collect(groupingBy(Item::txnId))\r\n````\r\nthis will result in a `Map&lt;String,List&lt;Item&gt;&gt;`: \r\n````\r\n{ PQR=[Item[sku=B, quantity=2, amount=200, txnId=PQR], \r\n       Item[sku=B, quantity=2, amount=200, txnId=PQR], \r\n       Item[sku=A, quantity=2, amount=200, txnId=PQR]\r\n      ], \r\n  ABC=[Item[sku=A, quantity=1, amount=100, txnId=ABC],

list by `sku`:\r\n````\r\nlist\r\n.stream()\r\n.collect(groupingBy(Item::txnId, \r\n                    groupingBy(Item::sku)))\r\n````\r\nresulting in a `Map&lt;String,Map&lt;String,List&lt;Item&gt;&gt;`:\r\n````\r\n{ PQR={ A=[ Item[sku=A, quantity=2, amount=200, txnId=PQR] ], \r\n        B=[ Item[sku=B, quantity=2, amount=200, txnId=PQR], \r\n            Item[sku=B, quantity=2, amount=200, txnId=PQR] ]\r\n      }, \r\n  ABC={ A=[ Item[sku=A, quantity=1, amount=100, txnId=ABC], \r\n            Item[sku=A, quantity=3, amount=300, txnId=ABC] ], \r\n        B=[ Item[sku=B, quantity=2, amount=200, txnId=ABC] ]\r\n      }\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n- Third step reduce the internal lists, summing the values: \r\n\r\nI will assume we have a `sum` method to sum 2 `Item`s returning a new one, very simplified:\r\n````\r\nItem {\r\n    // fields\r\n    // getters and setters\r\n\r\n    public static Item sum(Item item1, Item item2) {\r\n        return new Item(item2.sku, item1.quantity+item2.qantity, item1.amount+item2.amount, item2.txnId);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n````\r\n&lt;sup&gt;this could also be defined as a 1-arg non-static method&lt;/sup&gt; \r\n\r\nNow we can use `reducing` to *add* up the elements of the internal list:\r\n````\r\nlist\r\n.stream()\r\n.collect(groupingBy(Item::txnId, \r\n                    groupingBy(Item::sku,\r\n                               reducing(new Item(null, 0, 0, null),\r\n                                        Item::sum))))\r\n```` \r\nfinally resulting in:\r\n````\r\n{ PQR={ A=Item[sku=A, quantity=2, amount=200, txnId=PQR], \r\n        B=Item[sku=B, quantity=4, amount=400, txnId=PQR]\r\n      }, \r\n  ABC={ A=Item[sku=A, quantity=4, amount=400, txnId=ABC], \r\n        B=Item[sku=B, quantity=2, amount=200, txnId=ABC]\r\n      }\r\n}\r\n```` \r\n\r\n-----\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNote1: A Lambda expression may be used instead of the `sum` method for `reducing`:\r\n````\r\n....reducing( new Item(null, 0, 0, null),\r\n              (i1,i2) -&gt; new Item(i2.sku,\r\n                                  i1.quantity+i2.quantity,\r\n

second `groupingBy`:\r\n````\r\n... collectingAndThen( groupingBy(Item::sku, ...), Map:values ) ...\r\n````","title":"Java Streams, GroupBy and sum quantities similar items in the

&quot;PQR&quot;),\n  new Item(&quot;B&quot;, 2, 200, &quot;PQR&quot;),\n  new Item(&quot;A&quot;, 2, 200, &quot;PQR&quot;));\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>First step: group by <code>txnId</code> as already in question:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>list.stream().collect(groupingBy(Item::txnId))\n</code></pre>\n<p>this will result in a <code>Map&lt;String,List&lt;Item&gt;&gt;</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>{ PQR=[Item[sku=B, quantity=2, amount=200, txnId=PQR], \n       Item[sku=B, quantity=2, amount=200, txnId=PQR], \n       Item[sku=A, quantity=2, amount=200, txnId=PQR]\n      ], \n  ABC=[Item[sku=A, quantity=1, amount=100, txnId=ABC], \n       Item[sku=B, quantity=2, amount=200, txnId=ABC], \n       Item[sku=A, quantity=3, amount=300, txnId=ABC]\n      ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>Second step: group each <em>internal</em> list by <code>sku</code>:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>list\n.stream()\n.collect(groupingBy(Item::txnId, \n                    groupingBy(Item::sku)))\n</code></pre>\n<p>resulting in a <code>Map&lt;String,Map&lt;String,List&lt;Item&gt;&gt;</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>{ PQR={ A=[ Item[sku=A, quantity=2, amount=200, txnId=PQR] ], \n        B=[ Item[sku=B, quantity=2, amount=200,

will assume we have a <code>sum</code> method to sum 2 <code>Item</code>s returning a new one, very simplified:</p>\n<pre><code>Item {\n    // fields\n    // getters and setters\n\n    public static Item sum(Item item1, Item item2) {\n        return new Item(item2.sku, item1.quantity+item2.qantity, item1.amount+item2.amount, item2.txnId);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><sup>this could also be defined as a 1-arg non-static method</sup></p>\n<p>Now we can use <code>reducing</code> to <em>add</em> up the elements of the internal list:</p>\n<pre><code>list\n.stream()\n.collect(groupingBy(Item::txnId, \n                    groupingBy(Item::sku,\n                               reducing(new Item(null, 0, 0, null),\n                                        Item::sum))))\n</code></pre>\n<p>finally resulting in:</p>\n<pre><code>{ PQR={ A=Item[sku=A, quantity=2, amount=200, txnId=PQR], \n        B=Item[sku=B, quantity=4, amount=400, txnId=PQR]\n      }, \n  ABC={ A=Item[sku=A, quantity=4, amount=400, txnId=ABC], \n        B=Item[sku=B, quantity=2, amount=200, txnId=ABC]\n      }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<hr />\n<p>Note1: A Lambda expression may be used instead of the <code>sum</code> method for <code>reducing</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>....reducing( new Item(null, 0, 0, null),\n              (i1,i2) -&gt; new Item(i2.sku,\n                                  i1.quantity+i2.quantity,\n                                  i1.amount+i2.amount,\n                                  i2.txnId) )\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note2: To convert the inner Maps to a List use <code>collectingAndThen</code> with <code>Map::values</code> <em>around</em> the second <code>groupingBy</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>... collectingAndThen( groupingBy(Item::sku, ...), Map:values )
