The color of the .track  is set with the CSS rule below : \r\n\r\n    .slider .track {\r\n          -fx-background-color:\r\n              -fx-shadow-highlight-color,\r\n              linear-gradient(to bottom, derive(-fx-text-box-border, -10%), -fx-text-box-border),\r\n              linear-gradient(to bottom,\r\n                derive(-fx-control-inner-background, -9%),\r\n                derive(-fx-control-inner-background, 0%),\r\n                derive(-fx-control-inner-background, -5%),\r\n                derive(-fx-control-inner-background, -12%)\r\n              );\r\n        -fx-background-insets: 0 0 -1 0, 0, 1;\r\n        -fx-background-radius: 0.25em, 0.25em, 0.166667em; /* 3 3 2 */\r\n        -fx-padding: 0.25em; /* 3 */\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThere are few things you need to do, the first one is to listen for value changes of your slider and second to update your track color depending on the slider&#39;s value. To set the background color you will need to set a linear-gradient to the background like  :\r\n\r\n`-fx-background-color: linear-gradient(to right, #2D819D START, #969696 END);`\r\n\r\nWith the code above, you will set a linear gradient background starting from the left to right using the color #2D819D which is the &#39;progress&#39; color and the #969696 which represents the remaining progress. Now the START and the END should be numbers and in order to have the look you want, both numbers must be equal so when the one stops the other starts. For example if you set :\r\n\r\n `-fx-background-color: linear-gradient(to right, #2D819D 20%, #969696 20%);`\r\n\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nThe real challenge is to find a way to set these values programmatically inside the ChangeListener of your slider. My first approach was to use a CSS variable like :\r\n\r\n    .slider .track{\r\n    \t-progress : 0.2;\r\n    \t-fx-background-color: linear-gradient(to right, #2D819D -progress, #969696 -progress);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd to update the `-progress` using inline CSS rules on ChangeListener. Sadly for some reason this is not supported. I would love to find out why too. Also, you can&#39;t apply inline CSS for the subclass, which means you can not do slider.setStyle(&quot;.track {...}&quot;); \r\n\r\nSo to summarize, you could either :\r\n\r\n**1.

CSS lookups can be problematic, because they will return `null` unless CSS has been applied and a layout pass has been made. The referenced answer avoids this by looking up the track *after* showing the stage, but this can be hard to achieve in some circumstances (particularly using FXML, where controller initialization necessarily happens before the UI is added to a scene). This answer also goes to some lengths to preserve the default style as much as is reasonably possible.\r\n\r\nThe basic strategy here is to:\r\n\r\n - use &quot;looked up colors&quot; to define the linear gradient which separates the track to the left of the value from the track to the right of the value\r\n - set the background color of the track based on the looked-up colors\r\n - use `setStyle(...)` on the slider to modify the looked-up color programmatically.\r\n\r\nThis avoids the CSS lookup, because looked-up colors are inherited in CSS. Thus it&#39;s enough to modify the looked-up color only on the slider itself: the track (to which you don&#39;t readily have a reference) will inherit the value.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s worth looking at the default CSS applied to the slider and its track, which you can see in the [source code](https://github.com/openjdk/jfx/blob/master/modules/javafx.controls/src/main/resources/com/sun/javafx/scene/control/skin/modena/modena.css#L957):\r\n\r\n    .slider .track {\r\n          -fx-background-color:\r\n              -fx-shadow-highlight-color,\r\n              linear-gradient(to bottom, derive(-fx-text-box-border, -10%), -fx-text-box-border),\r\n              linear-gradient(to bottom,\r\n                derive(-fx-control-inner-background, -9%),\r\n                derive(-fx-control-inner-background, 0%),\r\n                derive(-fx-control-inner-background, -5%),\r\n                derive(-fx-control-inner-background, -12%)\r\n              );\r\n        -fx-background-insets: 0 0 -1 0, 0, 1;\r\n        -fx-background-radius: 0.25em, 0.25em, 0.166667em; /* 3 3 2 */\r\n        -fx-padding: 0.25em; /* 3 */\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis background is a &quot;nested background&quot; with the nesting defined by the three background inset values. The first value for `-fx-background-color` defines a shadow 1 pixel below the track; the second (given by the first linear gradient) defines a 1-pixel border with a subtle gradient, and the third (the second linear gradient) defines the majority of the track: it is a subtle linear gradient based on the standard theme color `-fx-control-inner-background`.\r\n\r\nThe plan here is to retain the border and the shadow, and vary the piece in the middle using a linear gradient. Since we can&#39;t use a linear gradient as the target of another linear gradient, we will approximate the default center of the track with `-fx-control-inner-background`:\r\n\r\n    .slider {\r\n        -default-track-color: -fx-control-inner-background;\r\n        -track-color: -default-track-color ;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand then use the same construct to wrap the shadow and border around the track color. Note we can just use the default insets and padding defined in the default stylesheet: there is no need to redefine them here:\r\n\r\n    .slider .track {\r\n        -fx-background-color: -fx-shadow-highlight-color,\r\n              linear-gradient(to bottom, derive(-fx-text-box-border, -10%), -fx-text-box-border),\r\n              -track-color;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow in the Java code we can just update the `-track-color` defined by the slider:\r\n\r\n        slider.valueProperty().addListener((obs, oldValue, newValue) -&gt; {\r\n            double percentage = 100.0 * newValue.doubleValue() / slider.getMax();\r\n            String style = String.format(\r\n                    // in the String format, \r\n                    // %1$.1f%% gives the first format argument (&quot;1$&quot;),\r\n                    // i.e. percentage, formatted to 1 decimal place (&quot;.1f&quot;).\r\n                    // Note literal % signs must be escaped (&quot;%%&quot;)\r\n                    &quot;-track-color: linear-gradient(to right, &quot; +\r\n                            &quot;-fx-accent 0%%, &quot; +\r\n                            &quot;-fx-accent %1$.1f%%, &quot; +\r\n                            &quot;-default-track-color %1$.1f%%, &quot; +\r\n                            &quot;-default-track-color 100%%);&quot;,\r\n                    percentage);\r\n            slider.setStyle(style);\r\n        });\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a complete example:\r\n\r\nstyle.css:\r\n\r\n    .slider {\r\n        -default-track-color: -fx-control-inner-background;\r\n        -track-color: -default-track-color ;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    .slider .track {\r\n        -fx-background-color: -fx-shadow-highlight-color,\r\n              linear-gradient(to bottom, derive(-fx-text-box-border, -10%), -fx-text-box-border),\r\n              -track-color;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    import javafx.application.Application;\r\n    import javafx.scene.Scene;\r\n    import javafx.scene.control.Slider;\r\n    import javafx.scene.layout.BorderPane;\r\n    import javafx.stage.Stage;\r\n    \r\n    import java.io.IOException;\r\n    \r\n    public class ProgressSlider extends Application {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void start(Stage stage) throws IOException {\r\n            Slider slider = new Slider();\r\n            slider.valueProperty().addListener((obs, oldValue, newValue) -&gt; {\r\n                double percentage = 100.0 * newValue.doubleValue() / slider.getMax();\r\n                String style = String.format(\r\n                        &quot;-track-color: linear-gradient(to right, &quot; +\r\n                                &quot;-fx-accent 0%%, &quot; +\r\n                                &quot;-fx-accent %1$.1f%%, &quot; +\r\n                                &quot;-default-track-color %1$.1f%%, &quot; +\r\n                                &quot;-default-track-color 100%%);&quot;,\r\n                        percentage);\r\n                slider.setStyle(style);\r\n            });\r\n            BorderPane root = new BorderPane(slider);\r\n            Scene scene = new Scene(root, 400, 400);\r\n            scene.getStylesheets().add(getClass().getResource(&quot;style.css&quot;).toExternalForm());\r\n            stage.setScene(scene);\r\n            stage.show();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            launch();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Om2F.png","title":"how to change fill color of slider in javafx","body":"<p>Here is a slight variation on <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4167500/jkostikiadis\">@JKostikiadis</a>'s <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/51344773/2189127\">answer</a> which avoids the CSS lookup. CSS lookups can be problematic, because they will return <code>null</code> unless CSS has been applied and a layout pass has been made. The referenced answer avoids this by looking up the track <em>after</em> showing the stage, but this can be hard to achieve in some circumstances (particularly using FXML, where controller initialization necessarily happens before the UI is added to a scene). This answer also goes to some lengths to preserve the default style as much as is reasonably possible.</p>\n<p>The basic strategy here is to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>use &quot;looked up colors&quot; to define the linear gradient which separates the track to the left of the value from the track to the right of the value</li>\n<li>set the background color of the track based on the looked-up colors</li>\n<li>use <code>setStyle(...)</code> on the slider to modify the looked-up color programmatically.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This avoids the CSS lookup, because looked-up colors are inherited in CSS. Thus it's enough to modify the looked-up color only on the slider itself: the track (to which you don't readily have a reference) will inherit the value.</p>\n<p>It's worth looking at the default CSS applied to the slider and its track, which you can see in the <a href=\"https://github.com/openjdk/jfx/blob/master/modules/javafx.controls/src/main/resources/com/sun/javafx/scene/control/skin/modena/modena.css#L957\" rel=\"noreferrer\">source code</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>.slider .track {\n      -fx-background-color:\n          -fx-shadow-highlight-color,\n          linear-gradient(to bottom, derive(-fx-text-box-border, -10%), -fx-text-box-border),\n          linear-gradient(to bottom,\n            derive(-fx-control-inner-background, -9%),\n            derive(-fx-control-inner-background, 0%),\n            derive(-fx-control-inner-background, -5%),\n            derive(-fx-control-inner-background, -12%)\n          );\n    -fx-background-insets: 0 0 -1 0, 0, 1;\n    -fx-background-radius: 0.25em, 0.25em, 0.166667em; /* 3 3 2 */\n    -fx-padding: 0.25em; /* 3 */\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This background is a &quot;nested background&quot; with the nesting defined by the three background inset values. The first value for <code>-fx-background-color</code> defines a shadow 1 pixel below the track; the second (given by the first linear gradient) defines a 1-pixel border with a subtle gradient, and the third (the second linear gradient) defines the majority of the track: it is a subtle linear gradient based on the standard theme color <code>-fx-control-inner-background</code>.</p>\n<p>The plan here is to retain the border and the shadow, and vary the piece in the middle using a linear gradient.

As a result, Name Canonicalization behavior cannot be customized. The client will claim support for it in every `TGT` request if `sun.security.krb5.disableReferrals` is `false`, and the KDC service may change the client name.\r\n\r\nJDK 11: The &#39;`canonicalize`&#39; flag in the `krb5.conf` file is now supported by the JDK Kerberos implementation. When set to true.\r\nThe new default behavior is different from previous releases where name canonicalization was always requested by clients in `TGT` requests to `KDC` services (provided that support for [RFC 6806][11] was not explicitly disabled with the sun.security.krb5.disableReferrals system or security properties)\r\n\r\nThis issue was seen in few minor `Java` 8 version(1.8.0_242) as well. You can try the example in the ticket to reproduce. [JDK-8239385][12] &lt;br/&gt;\r\nSome more information [JDK-8244465][13]\r\n\r\nCross-Realm Referrals Support is enabled by default and 5 is the maximum number of referral hops allowed. To turn it off, set the `sun.security.krb5.disableReferrals` security or system property to false. To configure a custom maximum number of referral hops, set the `sun.security.krb5.maxReferrals` security or system property to any positive value.\r\n\r\nYou can try changing the `JAAS` config to use a ticket in the ticket cache created upfront using kinit.&lt;br/&gt;\r\nYou can try to upgrade the java version as well.\r\n\r\n**Update from discussion in the comments section**:\r\n\r\n    by: sun.security.krb5.KrbException: Invalid option in ticket request. (101)\r\n\r\nThis could be linked to `proxiable=true` in your krb5.conf. Removing the value can help in resolving the issue.\r\n\r\n    Kerberos authentication fails with “java.nio.BufferOverflowException&quot;\r\nThis issue could be related to the JDBC driver. The current version may  not support the operation.

We&#39;re entering the `if`-body (as `tokens[0] == 1`), declare an `sbuf` variable and again make exactly the same check for that `i` (but we&#39;re inside the `if`-block with the same check as your `while` condition). So, we&#39;re going inside while loop, append `tokens[0]` to `sbuf` and **increase** our `i`. So now `i` is 1 and points to `+`, while condition is `false`, we parse `&quot;1&quot;` into 1 and add it to `values`. But now the next iteration of outer for-loop begins and the `i` value will be `2`.

Next we&#39;re checking the next value of `i` without incrementing. If it is also a number we&#39;re incrementing `i` and appending it to `sb`.
