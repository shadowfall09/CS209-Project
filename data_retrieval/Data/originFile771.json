Once that state is found the series of moves is known and can be returned.</p>\n<p>Here is an implementation of both the conversion to stacks and of the backtracking algorithm:</p>\n<pre><code>def getstacks(board):\n    counts = [0, 0, 0]\n    # Convert data structure to stacks -- one stack per column\n    stacks = [[] for _ in board[0]]\n    for row, values in enumerate(reversed(board)):\n        for col, (value, stack) in enumerate(zip(values, stacks)):\n            if value:\n                # Verify there are no holes\n                if len(stack) != row:\n                    raise ValueError(f&quot;The disc at {row+1},{col+1} should not be floating above an empty cell&quot;)\n                stack.append(value)\n                counts[value] += 1\n    if not (0 &lt;= counts[1] - counts[2] &lt;= 1):\n        raise ValueError(&quot;Number of discs per player is inconsistent&quot;)\n    return stacks, 1 + counts[1] - counts[2] \n\n\ndef searchmoves(stacks, player):\n    # Perform a depth first search with backtracking\n    for col, stack in enumerate(stacks):\n        if stack and stack[-1] == player:\n            stack.pop()\n            moves = searchmoves(stacks, 3 - player)\n            stack.append(player)  # Restore\n            if moves is not None:  # Success\n                moves.append(col + 1)\n                return moves\n    if any(stacks):\n        return None  # Stuck: backtrack.\n    return []  # Success: all discs were removed\n\n\ndef solve(board):\n    stacks, nextplayer = getstacks(board)\n    return searchmoves(stacks, 3 - nextplayer)\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can run it as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>board = [\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,2,0,0],\n    [0,0,1,0,1,0,0],\n    [0,0,2,1,2,0,0],\n] \nprint(solve(board))  # [4, 5, 5, 3, 3, 5]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another example run:</p>\n<pre><code>board =  [\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0],\n    [0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0]\n]\nprint(solve(board))  # [6, 5, 3, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 3, 4, 2]\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":20266730,"reputation":41,"user_id":14863727,"display_name":"django"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":115,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":74950580,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1672330292,"creation_date":1672304078,"question_id":74949047,"body_markdown":"I wanted to know weather we can calculate the move order for a given Connect4 board, such that if the moves are played out sequentially from an empty board, we get the current position on board.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n[![current position](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YdJ2I.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YdJ2I.png)\r\n\r\nI have this position matrix for the above pictured board state:\r\n\r\n```\r\nboard = [\r\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\r\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\r\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\r\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\r\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],\r\n    [0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0],\r\n] \r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I know the coordinates of the coins from this picture:\r\n\r\n- row 1 col 3 = yellow\r\n- row 1 col 4 = red\r\n- row 1 col 5 = yellow\r\n- row 2 col 3 = red\r\n- row 2 col 5 = red\r\n- row 3 col 5 = yellow\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, the move order (columns) played was: 4, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5:\r\n\r\nRed and yellow moves alternate.

Both show similar behavior, i.e. printing out a log line when working but not in my updated project.\nThis brings me to the assumption, that it is no problem with the jpa-metamodel-gen but rather with APT itself.</p>\n<p>Where should I be looking next?</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n<p>I have done some more researching. Via gradle --debug I was able to extract the actual <code>javac</code> call. Executing that from console shows the same error.</p>\n<p>I reduced the number of elements to be compiled. It seems that putting an actual entity on the list of things to be compiled the APT generator goes dormant. Putting only a <code>MappedEntity</code> supertype on the list will still leave the APT active. WTF?</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT2</strong></p>\n<p>I am currently on my way to a reproducable exmaple. I've cut through a lot of business-related libs and right now, what I have is a havac call, where <code>-processorpath</code> only mentions the jpamodelgen and <code>-classpath</code> only mentions hibernate core (both in Version 6.1.6).</p>\n<p>In this constellation the modelgen does not work. As soon as I eliminate the hibernate-core, it works.</p>\n<p>Next step: I'll strip down the entities.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","hana"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":6655693,"reputation":3515,"user_id":5136580,"display_name":"Mikel Rychliski"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1586279908,"creation_date":1586279908,"answer_id":61085686,"question_id":60739606,"body_markdown":"The HANA 2.4.x JDBC driver supports JRE 6 **and later**","title":"Does ngdbc.jar (2.4.67 or above) support JRE 11?","body":"<p>The HANA 2.4.x JDBC driver supports JRE 6 <strong>and later</strong></p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2179728,"reputation":73077,"user_id":10819573,"display_name":"Arvind Kumar Avinash"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1672328908,"creation_date":1672328908,"answer_id":74953225,"question_id":60739606,"body_markdown":"Yes, it does.

Add the ePOS2.jar (and ePOSEasySelect.jar if needed) file to the &quot;Jars&quot; folder and set the file&#39;s build action (in the properties window) to &quot;EmbeddedJar&quot;.\r\n 3. INSTALL THE OPOS Common Control Objects (CCOs) locally (OPOS_CCOs_1.14.001.msi) from the [Epson ePOS SDK for Android download][1].\r\n 4. Copy all of the resulting .dll files to your project from step 1. I&#39;ve used a &quot;lib&quot; folder within it, but you do you.\r\n 5. Reference the .dlls from the project.\r\n 6.

(And without degrading the performance in case the answer is the complete set.)\r\n\r\n- Loop over the *interesting* positions from left to right. An interesting position is where a parent or child interval starts or ends.\r\n- If the position is a parent:\r\n  - If this the start of the parent, add the parent to a linked hashset of started parents.\r\n  - Otherwise it&#39;s the end of the parent.

Let&#39;s analyze the program like it was written using `char cLeft = str.charAt(l % str.length())` instead to make it a little more interesting.\r\n\r\nI feel like the main argument should be based on the &quot;total number of character count&quot; stored in `map` (a map of character to counter pairs). Here are some facts, mainly:\r\n\r\n1. The **outter** loop always **increases** a single counter by exactly one.\r\n2. The **inner** loop always **decreases** a single counter by exactly one.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\n3. The inner loop ensure that all counters are positive (removes counters when they are equal to 0).\r\n4. The inner loop runs as long as the number of (positive) counters is `&gt; k`.  \r\n\r\n**Lemma** For the inner loop to be executed C times in total, the outer loop needs to be executed at least C times in total.\r\n\r\n**Proof** Suppose the outer loop is executed `C` times, and the inner loop at least `C + 1` times, that means it exists an iteration `r` of the outer loop in which the inner loop is executed `r + 1` times. During this iteration `r` of the outer loop, at some point (by 1. and 2.) the sum of all character counters in `map` will equal `0`. By fact 3., this means that there are no counter left (`map.size()` equals 0). Since `k &gt; 0`, during iteration `r` it is impossible to enter the inner loop for a `r + 1` time because of 4.. A contradiction that proves the Lemma is true.\r\n \r\nLess formally, the inner loop will never execute if the sum of counters is 0 because the total sum of `k` (`&gt; 0`) positives counters is greater than `0`. In other words, the consumer (inner loop) can&#39;t consume more than what is being produced (by the outer loop).\r\n\r\nBecause of this Lemma and because the outer loop executes exactly N times, the inner loop executes at most `N` times. In total we will execute at most `A * N` function calls in the outter loop, and `B * N` function calls in the inner loop, both `A` and `B` are constants and all functions are in `O(1)`, therefore `(A + B) * N ∈ O(N)`. \r\n\r\nAlso note that writing `O(N + N)` is a pleonasm (or doesn&#39;t make sense) because big-O is supposed to ignore all constant factors (both multiplicative and additive). Usually people will not write equations using big-O notations because it is hard to write something correct and formal (appart for obvious set inclusions like `O(log N) ∈ O(N)`).

Usually you would say something like &quot;all operations are in <code>O(N)</code>, therefore the algorithm is in <code>O(N)</code>&quot;.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":444292,"reputation":1,"user_id":836018,"accept_rate":57,"display_name":"Jack"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":260,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1674562252,"accepted_answer_id":74950402,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1672312494,"creation_date":1671999163,"question_id":74915663,"body_markdown":"In a Java app, I have the following algorithm that is used for &quot;Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters&quot; as shown below:\r\n\r\n&gt;Input:&#160;String=&quot;araaci&quot;,&#160;K=2\r\nOutput:&#160;4\r\nExplanation:&#160;The&#160;longest&#160;substring&#160;with&#160;no&#160;more&#160;than&#160;&#39;2&#39;&#160;distinct&#160;characters&#160;is&#160;&quot;araa&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;Input:&#160;String=&quot;cbbebi&quot;,&#160;K=3\r\nOutput:&#160;5\r\nExplanation:&#160;The&#160;longest&#160;substrings&#160;with&#160;no&#160;more&#160;than&#160;&#39;3&#39;&#160;distinct&#160;characters&#160;are&#160;&quot;cbbeb&quot;&#160;&amp;&#160;&quot;bbebi&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the code:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static int longestSubstring(String str, int k) {\r\n    Map&lt;Character, Integer&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n    int maxLength = 0;\r\n    int l = 0;\r\n\r\n    for (int r = 0; r &lt; str.length(); r++) {\r\n        char cRight = str.charAt(r);\r\n        map.put(cRight, map.getOrDefault(cRight, 0) + 1);\r\n\r\n        while (map.size() &gt; k) {\r\n            char cLeft = str.charAt(l);\r\n            map.put(cLeft, map.getOrDefault(cLeft, 0) - 1);\r\n            if (map.get(cLeft) == 0) {\r\n                map.remove(cLeft);\r\n            }\r\n            l++;\r\n        }\r\n        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, r - l + 1);\r\n    }\r\n    return maxLength;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could not understand the time complexity in the following definition:\r\n\r\n**Time Complexity**\r\nThe time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) where ‘N’ is the number of characters in the input string.
