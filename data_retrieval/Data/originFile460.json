Lets have the `Parameter` class that would hold our key-value**\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Parameter {\r\n    String key;\r\n    Object value;\r\n\r\n    public Parameter(String key, Object value){\r\n        this.key = key;\r\n        this.value = value;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getKey() {\r\n        return key;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public Object getValue() {\r\n        return value;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**1.

Now we can build a flag mask that would hold enable/disable flag for all combinations**\r\n\r\n```java\r\nboolean[][] getCombinations(Parameter[] parameters){\r\n    int rowNum = (int)Math.pow(2, parameters.length);\r\n    boolean[][] results = new boolean[rowNum][parameters.length];\r\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; rowNum; i++){\r\n        boolean[] line = getCombination(i, parameters.length);\r\n        for(int j = 0; j &lt; parameters.length; j++){\r\n            results[i][j] = line[j];\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return results;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**3.

This comes in several different flavors: start on application server host, start on gateway, start on frontend PC and some others, if I remember correctly.\r\n\r\nIn the first case (&quot;registered server&quot;), the connection already exists (it was created by the server program, when registering under the given program ID), and the SAP system simply sends any RFC request for this destination over this open connection.\r\n\r\nIn the second case (started server), the mechanism is completely different. The SAP system first generates a unique ID (CPIC conversation ID), tells the gateway to start listening for an incoming connection with that ID, then starts the given executable and tells it to open a connection with exactly that ID. When the gateway reports, that someone with that ID has indeed opened a connection, the SAP system finally sends the RFC request over it. The executable is started in several different ways, depending on the &quot;flavor&quot; of the destination: via fork (&quot;start on gateway&quot;), via remote shell (&quot;start on a given app server host&quot;) or by sending the name of the executable and the start parameters back to SAPGui over the currently open DIAG connection connecting SAPGui with the current ABAP side user session. SAPGui then starts the executable with the given parameters (&quot;start on frontend PC&quot;).\r\n\r\nAs Trixx already said: JCo3 only supports the registered server, but not the started server. If you need an RFC server of that type (e.g. because you want to have it started on the frontend PC via SAPGui), you will need to write either a C/C++ program using the NetWeaver RFC Library or a .NET program using NCo3. Both, NCo3 as well as NW RFC Library provide the necessary functionality for a started server.

This comes in several different flavors: start on application server host, start on gateway, start on frontend PC and some others, if I remember correctly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the first case (\"registered server\"), the connection already exists (it was created by the server program, when registering under the given program ID), and the SAP system simply sends any RFC request for this destination over this open connection.</p>\n\n<p>In the second case (started server), the mechanism is completely different. The SAP system first generates a unique ID (CPIC conversation ID), tells the gateway to start listening for an incoming connection with that ID, then starts the given executable and tells it to open a connection with exactly that ID. When the gateway reports, that someone with that ID has indeed opened a connection, the SAP system finally sends the RFC request over it. The executable is started in several different ways, depending on the \"flavor\" of the destination: via fork (\"start on gateway\"), via remote shell (\"start on a given app server host\") or by sending the name of the executable and the start parameters back to SAPGui over the currently open DIAG connection connecting SAPGui with the current ABAP side user session. SAPGui then starts the executable with the given parameters (\"start on frontend PC\").</p>\n\n<p>As Trixx already said: JCo3 only supports the registered server, but not the started server. If you need an RFC server of that type (e.g. because you want to have it started on the frontend PC via SAPGui), you will need to write either a C/C++ program using the NetWeaver RFC Library or a .NET program using NCo3. Both, NCo3 as well as NW RFC Library provide the necessary functionality for a started server.

The @Path annotation’s value is a partial URI path template relative to the base URI of the server on which the resource is deployed, the context root of the application, and the URL pattern to which the JAX-RS runtime responds.\r\n    \r\n    URI path templates are URIs with variables embedded within the URI syntax. These variables are substituted at runtime in order for a resource to respond to a request based on the substituted URI. Variables are denoted by braces ({ and }). For example, look at the following @Path annotation:\r\n    \r\n    @Path(&quot;/users/{username}&quot;)\r\n    In this kind of example, a user is prompted to type his or her name, and then a JAX-RS web service configured to respond to requests to this URI path template responds. For example, if the user types the user name “Galileo,” the web service responds to the following URL:\r\n    \r\n    http://example.com/users/Galileo\r\n    To obtain the value of the user name, the @PathParam annotation may be used on the method parameter of a request method, as shown in the following code example:\r\n    \r\n    @Path(&quot;/users/{username}&quot;)\r\n    public class UserResource {\r\n    \r\n        @GET\r\n        @Produces(&quot;text/xml&quot;)\r\n        public String getUser(@PathParam(&quot;username&quot;) String userName) {\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n    The @Produces Annotation\r\n    The @Produces annotation is used to specify the MIME media types or representations a resource can produce and send back to the client. If @Produces is applied at the class level, all the methods in a resource can produce the specified MIME types by default. If applied at the method level, the annotation overrides any @Produces annotations applied at the class level.\r\n    \r\n    If no methods in a resource are able to produce the MIME type in a client request, the JAX-RS runtime sends back an HTTP “406 Not Acceptable” error.\r\n    \r\n    The value of @Produces is an array of String of MIME types. For example:\r\n    \r\n    @Produces({&quot;image/jpeg,image/png&quot;})\r\n    The following example shows how to apply @Produces at both the class and method levels:\r\n    \r\n    @Path(&quot;/myResource&quot;)\r\n    @Produces(&quot;text/plain&quot;)\r\n    public class SomeResource {\r\n        @GET\r\n        public String doGetAsPlainText() {\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @GET\r\n        @Produces(&quot;text/html&quot;)\r\n        public String doGetAsHtml() {\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    The @Consumes Annotation\r\n    The @Consumes annotation is used to specify which MIME media types of representations a resource can accept, or consume, from the client. If @Consumes is applied at the class level, all the response methods accept the specified MIME types by default. If applied at the method level, @Consumes overrides any @Consumes annotations applied at the class level.\r\n    \r\n    If a resource is unable to consume the MIME type of a client request, the JAX-RS runtime sends back an HTTP 415 (“Unsupported Media Type”) error.\r\n    \r\n    The value of @Consumes is an array of String of acceptable MIME types. For example:\r\n    \r\n    @Consumes({&quot;text/plain,text/html&quot;})\r\n    The following example shows how to apply @Consumes at both the class and method levels:\r\n    \r\n    @Path(&quot;/myResource&quot;)\r\n    @Consumes(&quot;multipart/related&quot;)\r\n    public class SomeResource {\r\n        @POST\r\n        public String doPost(MimeMultipart mimeMultipartData) {\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @POST\r\n        @Consumes(&quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;)\r\n        public String doPost2(FormURLEncodedProperties formData) {\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n    }","title":"Java Servlets Without Extending a Servlet Class","body":"<p>Like the answer above mentions, what you're seeing are Java annotations in general.</p>\n<p>Here's a general link about that <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/basics.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/basics.html</a></p>\n<p>Also the links above answer bring me to page not found pages but here are links I found discussing the @Path annotations and others that are associated with RESTful web services:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19798-01/821-1841/6nmq2cp26/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19798-01/821-1841/6nmq2cp26/index.html</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gilik.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gilik.html</a></p>\n<p>Here's some snippets from the links:</p>\n<pre><code>The @Path annotation identifies the URI path template to which the resource responds and is specified at the class or method level of a resource.
