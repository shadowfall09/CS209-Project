SP sometimes known as modular programming, this is a technique devised to improve the reliability and clarity of programs. In SP, the program flow control is restricted to three structures (i.e., sequences, selection [`IF`/`THEN`/`ELSE`], and repetitions [`FOR`/`WHILE`]), or to a structure derivable from a combination of those. The result is a program built of modules that are highly independent of each other. This enforces a logical structure on the program being written to make it more efficient and easier to understand and modify.\r\n\r\nPython supports Procedural Programming (PP). PP is a programming paradigm, derived from SP, based upon the concept of the procedure call. A procedure call is a simple statement made by stating the procedure name, and listing actual parameter names or values within parentheses. So this paradigm is about writing a list of instructions to tell the computer what to do step by step. It relies on procedures, witch simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out.  \r\n\r\nJava only supports object-oriented programming (OOP). This main focus is about encapsulating data and behavior into objects. An OOP application will use a collection of objects which knows how to perform certain actions and how to interact with other elements of the application. For instance, an object could be a person. That person would have a name (that would be a property of the object), and would know how to walk (that would be a method). A method in OOP can be considered as a procedure in PP, but here it belongs to a specific object. Another important aspect of OOP are classes. A class can be considered as a blueprint for an object.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What this means?\r\n\r\nAs this simple definition says, **Java** is a **class-based** and **object-oriented** programming language. So when the user asked: *&quot;Can I just create the program directly the way I do it in other languages?&quot;*, the answer is *NO*, because it is not part of the definition of the language.\r\n\r\n### Why can C and Python do that? \r\nWell, it is because **C* and **Python** support non-member functions, while **Java** supports only member functions.\r\n\r\n### What is the difference between a member function and a non-member function?\r\nBasically, a **non-member function** always is defined out of a class. While a **member function** must defined as part of a class. This is to identify that that function is a member of a particular class. Another difference between **member functions** and **non-member functions** is how they are called (or invoked).\r\nTo call a **member function** you need a class object to get access to the function, but **non-member functions** can be invoked directly.\r\n\r\n### TL;DR\r\n\r\n**Java** needs a class to define a member function like `main()` because it only supports OOP. So, if you want a very minimal program, you can create a class with a `main()` method. Consider the following segment of code:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class MainClass {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args)  {\r\n        System.out.print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is the equivalent in C:\r\n\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n   printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);\r\n   return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","title":"Is it necessary to create a Java class everytime?","body":"<p>I know this is an old question but I think the question is important to clarify something.

Consider the following segment of code:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class MainClass {\n    public static void main(String[] args)  {\n        System.out.print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the equivalent in C:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-c prettyprint-override\"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main()\n{\n   printf(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);\n   return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":4652704,"reputation":333,"user_id":4465332,"accept_rate":86,"display_name":"Kira"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":4378,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":9,"accepted_answer_id":29927544,"answer_count":5,"score":8,"last_activity_date":1666060109,"creation_date":1430246759,"question_id":29927462,"body_markdown":"I am starting to learn the Java programming language and I am a little confused.\r\n\r\nI would like to create a simple program like adding two numbers or calculate the sum of n numbers.

A good reference for this is Joshua Bloch&#39;s &quot;Effective Java&quot; (which I strongly recommend any Java programmer should read); in the second and third editions it is Item 1.\r\n\r\nFor the specific classes you mention:\r\n\r\n`Color`\r\n---\r\n\r\nSince factory methods have names, using factory methods allows for multiple methods with the same signature. E.g.\r\n\r\n    public static Color color(double red, double green, double blue);\r\n    public static Color hsb(double hue, double saturation, double brightness);\r\n\r\nThese could not be replaced by two different constructors, as they would be ambiguous.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it could be argued that the factory methods provide more descriptive names. For example, the two methods\r\n\r\n\r\n    public static Color valueOf(String value);\r\n    public static Color web(String colorString);\r\n\r\nhave exactly the same functionality, but both are valuable from a design perspective. The `valueOf()` method allows for interaction with the `FXMLLoader`, whereas the `web(...)` method is more appropriately named (it takes a string in the same format as is used in the HTML specification).\r\n\r\n`Font`\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe rationale for this class is less clear, and knowing the exact reasons would require knowing the mind of the original API designers. However, note that the [API specification](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/18/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/text/Font.html) of the static factory method differs from the constructor:\r\n\r\n    public static Font font(String family, double size)\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Searches for an appropriate font based on the font family name and size. This method is not guaranteed to return a specific font, but does its best to find one that fits the specified requirements.

A good reference for this is Joshua Bloch's &quot;Effective Java&quot; (which I strongly recommend any Java programmer should read); in the second and third editions it is Item 1.</p>\n<p>For the specific classes you mention:</p>\n<h2><code>Color</code></h2>\n<p>Since factory methods have names, using factory methods allows for multiple methods with the same signature. E.g.</p>\n<pre><code>public static Color color(double red, double green, double blue);\npublic static Color hsb(double hue, double saturation, double brightness);\n</code></pre>\n<p>These could not be replaced by two different constructors, as they would be ambiguous.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it could be argued that the factory methods provide more descriptive names. For example, the two methods</p>\n<pre><code>public static Color valueOf(String value);\npublic static Color web(String colorString);\n</code></pre>\n<p>have exactly the same functionality, but both are valuable from a design perspective. The <code>valueOf()</code> method allows for interaction with the <code>FXMLLoader</code>, whereas the <code>web(...)</code> method is more appropriately named (it takes a string in the same format as is used in the HTML specification).</p>\n<h2><code>Font</code></h2>\n<p>The rationale for this class is less clear, and knowing the exact reasons would require knowing the mind of the original API designers. However, note that the <a href=\"https://openjfx.io/javadoc/18/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/text/Font.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">API specification</a> of the static factory method differs from the constructor:</p>\n<pre><code>public static Font font(String family, double size)\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Searches for an appropriate font based on the font family name and size. This method is not guaranteed to return a specific font, but does its best to find one that fits the specified requirements. A null or empty value for family allows the implementation to select any suitable font.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>public Font(String name, double size)\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Constructs a font using the specified full face name and size</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as I can tell, the current implementation is actually the same, but the API specification allows for that to change in future releases. There may be other benefits too, e.g. the static factory method <em>could</em> cache fonts and return the same instance if that were determined to be a performance enhancement.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":14337166,"reputation":69,"user_id":19422364,"display_name":"HLR"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":110,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":7,"accepted_answer_id":74098559,"answer_count":1,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1666047190,"creation_date":1666013125,"question_id":74098053,"body_markdown":"In JavaFX, there are a few classes, for example javafx.scene.text.Font and javafx.scene.paint.Color that have static methods that act like constructors.
