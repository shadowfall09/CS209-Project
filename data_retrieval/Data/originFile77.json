Your own `ApplicationRunner` is in your own package and initializes all the beans in the package and subpackage by default, but the `ApplicationRunner` from Spring doesn&#39;t know about your package and won&#39;t do that.\r\n\r\nTo prevent confusion I recommend calling your `ApplicationRunner` something different (I used `MySpringApplication` in the example below but you could use some name specific to your application if you wanted).\r\n\r\n**Reference**\r\n\r\nFuther info on this topic is provided in the answer here:\r\n\r\n * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57887944/adding-spring-dependency-injection-in-javafx-jpa-repo-service/57896435#57896435\r\n\r\n**Working Code**\r\n\r\nTo create this, I created a new JavaFX project in Idea, removed the generated `module-info.java` to make the project non-modular (Java modularity and Spring 6 mix poorly unfortunately).  Downloaded and extracted the JavaFX 21 SDK from Gluon.  Right clicked on the class `MySpringApplication` to choose &quot;More Run/Debug: Modify the Run Configuration...&quot; set the VM parameters of the run configuration as:\r\n\r\n    --module-path /Users/&lt;username&gt;/Downloads/javafx-sdk-21/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml\r\n\r\nI modified the code to call your spring application `MySpringApplication` and import and use that in your `JavaFXApplication`.\r\n\r\nI removed all of the references to missing classes (most of that stuff is probably better handled in a service layer rather than in the Controller class anyway).\r\n\r\nI changed the database dependency to h2 from postgres so I didn&#39;t have to setup postgres.\r\n\r\nI removed the lombok dependency as I have seen other experienced developers note issues with it when used in the context of JavaFX and also recommend against its use in general.\r\n\r\nI modified the fxml so that it would load (it defined insets incorrectly, so I deleted those references).\r\n\r\nAn FXML controller is not a Spring controller, which is for use in a Java Servlet style framework, don&#39;t annotate your FXML controller with the Spring `@Controller` annotation, a `@Component` annotation with `prototype` scope is probably best. (I used the recommended annotations in my example).\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t use the JavaFX versions with `ea` in the name, they are early access versions, which may not be stable.  (I used a stable version - 21 - in my example).\r\n\r\n**Outstanding issue**\r\n\r\nThere is another likely issue with your code, which I didn&#39;t try to address.  Although you correctly set the controller factory to use the spring context to inject Spring bean references into the controller when you load the main window FXML:\r\n\r\n    fxmlLoader.setControllerFactory(context::getBean);\r\n\r\nYou don&#39;t set the controller factor for subsequent page loads which you perform in the `MainWindowController.loadWindow` method.  This means that none of these subsequent page loads will have spring beans injected into their related controllers.\r\n  \r\nI&#39;ll leave fixing this outstanding issue as an exercise for the reader

Downloaded and extracted the JavaFX 21 SDK from Gluon.  Right clicked on the class <code>MySpringApplication</code> to choose &quot;More Run/Debug: Modify the Run Configuration...&quot; set the VM parameters of the run configuration as:</p>\n<pre><code>--module-path /Users/&lt;username&gt;/Downloads/javafx-sdk-21/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml\n</code></pre>\n<p>I modified the code to call your spring application <code>MySpringApplication</code> and import and use that in your <code>JavaFXApplication</code>.</p>\n<p>I removed all of the references to missing classes (most of that stuff is probably better handled in a service layer rather than in the Controller class anyway).</p>\n<p>I changed the database dependency to h2 from postgres so I didn't have to setup postgres.</p>\n<p>I removed the lombok dependency as I have seen other experienced developers note issues with it when used in the context of JavaFX and also recommend against its use in general.</p>\n<p>I modified the fxml so that it would load (it defined insets incorrectly, so I deleted those references).</p>\n<p>An FXML controller is not a Spring controller, which is for use in a Java Servlet style framework, don't annotate your FXML controller with the Spring <code>@Controller</code> annotation, a <code>@Component</code> annotation with <code>prototype</code> scope is probably best. (I used the recommended annotations in my example).</p>\n<p>Don't use the JavaFX versions with <code>ea</code> in the name, they are early access versions, which may not be stable.  (I used a stable version - 21 - in my example).</p>\n<p><strong>Outstanding issue</strong></p>\n<p>There is another likely issue with your code, which I didn't try to address.  Although you correctly set the controller factory to use the spring context to inject Spring bean references into the controller when you load the main window FXML:</p>\n<pre><code>fxmlLoader.setControllerFactory(context::getBean);\n</code></pre>\n<p>You don't set the controller factor for subsequent page loads which you perform in the <code>MainWindowController.loadWindow</code> method.  This means that none of these subsequent page loads will have spring beans injected into their related controllers.</p>\n<p>I'll leave fixing this outstanding issue as an exercise for the reader

You select your desired recipient and tap on a second &quot;Send Money&quot; button, this then takes you to a success page that lists the amount sent and the username of the recepient (SendReceiverSuccessPage).\r\n\r\nOn the SendMoney page I need to get the amount inputted and pass that data to the SendReceiverSuccessPage, I&#39;ve done this by using `Intent` and I&#39;ve added this code to when the Send Money button is clicked, but in doing this what happens is that it for some reason creates multiple instances of the SendReceiver page it navigates to. So on the SendReceiver page when I&#39;m done and I hit the second &quot;Send Money&quot; button it just opens a new instance of SendReceiver whiles the SendReceiverSuccessPage is stuck in the background for some reason.  \r\n\r\nI need it to be one single smooth navigation flow where it goes from SendMoney to SendReceiver to SendReceiverSuccessPage without SendReceiver popping up multiple times and stacking on top of the success page, all whiles being able to actively pass and retrieve the &quot;AmountSent&quot;

The only problem is that the amount sent that I need to pass to the success page isn&#39;t recoreded or passed. So ideally, if I could find a way or alternative to getting this data to the desired page without putting it into the button OnClick or having it create multiple instances of the activity.\r\n","title":"Clicking on a button ends up making multiple instances of the Activity it navigates to","body":"<p>I'm making an app in Android Studio, its like a fintech app. In one activity/page(SendMoney.java), you put in a number amount and tap the &quot;Send Money&quot; button, from here it goes to the page where you choose who you're sending this money to (SendReceiver.java). You select your desired recipient and tap on a second &quot;Send Money&quot; button, this then takes you to a success page that lists the amount sent and the username of the recepient (SendReceiverSuccessPage).</p>\n<p>On the SendMoney page I need to get the amount inputted and pass that data to the SendReceiverSuccessPage, I've done this by using <code>Intent</code> and I've added this code to when the Send Money button is clicked, but in doing this what happens is that it for some reason creates multiple instances of the SendReceiver page it navigates to. So on the SendReceiver page when I'm done and I hit the second &quot;Send Money&quot; button it just opens a new instance of SendReceiver whiles the SendReceiverSuccessPage is stuck in the background for some reason.</p>\n<p>I need it to be one single smooth navigation flow where it goes from SendMoney to SendReceiver to SendReceiverSuccessPage without SendReceiver popping up multiple times and stacking on top of the success page, all whiles being able to actively pass and retrieve the &quot;AmountSent&quot;

AS LONG as these methods DO NOT depend on each other\r\n   (no reference interdependence).\r\n   \r\n - b) Optimizations such as parallelization ARE DONE on specific\r\n   mathematical operations done on ALU, and NEVER performed on\r\n   programmer&#39;s &quot;macro&quot; logic code... even if it could.\r\n   \r\n - c) The processor would NEVER do something outlandish like &quot;memory\r\n   hoisting&quot;, these events are ALWAYS a compiler side responsibility.\r\n   (see &quot;d&quot;)\r\n   \r\n - d) Register promotion (prosessor&#39;s bare-bones &quot;memory hoisting&quot;\r\n   mechanic) can only occur on primitives and require explicit instructions.\r\n   \r\n    -  d.1) My assumption is that libraries such as Java&#39;s Math. would\r\n   make use of such optimizations, but outside this, compilers will\r\n   never make a processor promote a register UNLESS NO OTHER register is\r\n   involved in the concurrent mathematical operation.\r\n\r\nOn Java&#39;s compiler...\r\n\r\n - e) Java&#39;s compiler and (JIT) implementations NEVER parallelize COMPLEX interdependencies, even if they could.\r\n\r\n    - e.1) Only on simple loops where no interdependencies are required.... like Arrays library Array/Collection pure-functional construction.\r\n\r\n - f) Activities such as memory hoisting are done on this level, NOT on the processor level.\r\n\r\n    - * Explanation of f: just think about it, If there is NO specific instruction to promote or prevent register promotion on memories other than primitives on the **processor level**, then latency prevention can only be achieved in the compiler level via hoisting... WHILE actions like double-checking DO INVOLVE the processor since the processor has the means to reorder and simplify the code... damaging the double-check in the process.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow let&#39;s examine the argument:     \r\n&gt; &quot;Ok, it works now, but... what about weakly memory ordered processors?&quot;\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that `volatile` AND `getAcquire` loads are &quot;levers&quot; meant to handle COMPILER + processor reordering BEHAVIOR... volatile(`seq_const`) and acquire DO HAVE influence over previous and subsequent loads and stores....\r\n\r\nBUT `getOpaque`/`memory_ordered_relaxed` is JUST a compiler handle.... that does NOTHING on the processor level... depending on the case, either it be hoisting-prevention... or simplification-prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince ALL it prevents is hoisting, then processors have no idea a `getOpaque` was even used...(?), depending on the case.\r\n\r\nThe biggest clue about my assumption is the name the lynux kernel defines the fence... as `read_once()`, as to tell the compiler &quot;This will not be read more than once, please do NOT HOIST-optimize&quot;\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nSo, de-virtualization is a behavior that &quot;almost never happens&quot; according to some answers on this site, and even if it DOES, it will only occur on situations on which the scope is &quot;contextually aknowledged&quot;... aka private/protected methods (inheritance by extension...)\r\n\r\nThis exempts: \r\npublic methods (relative to an outer scope), lambdas and static methods(not so sure about this one tbh).\r\n\r\nIn the next code I will try to demonstrate how a specific syntax will prevent load hoisting, by taking advantage of method virtualization.\r\nNote: On double-checking getOpaque/relaxed is still required.\r\n\r\nIF... for the code:\r\n\r\n       int plain = 0;\r\n       final Executor executor;\r\n    \r\n       Runnable readRunnable = () -&gt;

","title":"Does getOpaque/order_relaxed/read_once have influence on the processor, or just the compiler during memory hoisting?","body":"<p>I've had some discussion with multiple people on this issue, and there are some points that makes the usage of memory ordering fences on load situations somewhat confusing.</p>\n<p>The first bullet point seems to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>a) The level of processor reordering is limited by the amount of\nmethod de-virtualization done by the compiler.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>a.1) The processor can reorder instructions WITHIN a virtual method,\nBUT NOT OUT of the virtual method (unless de-virtualized).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>a.2) The processor CAN reorder virtual method calls, between OTHER virtual\nmethod calls... AS LONG as these methods DO NOT depend on each other\n(no reference interdependence).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>b) Optimizations such as parallelization ARE DONE on specific\nmathematical operations done on ALU, and NEVER performed on\nprogrammer's &quot;macro&quot; logic code... even if it could.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>c) The processor would NEVER do something outlandish like &quot;memory\nhoisting&quot;, these events are ALWAYS a compiler side responsibility.\n(see &quot;d&quot;)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>d) Register promotion (prosessor's bare-bones &quot;memory hoisting&quot;\nmechanic) can only occur on primitives and require explicit instructions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>d.1) My assumption is that libraries such as Java's Math. would\nmake use of such optimizations, but outside this, compilers will\nnever make a processor promote a register UNLESS NO OTHER register is\ninvolved in the concurrent mathematical operation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On Java's compiler...</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>e) Java's compiler and (JIT) implementations NEVER parallelize COMPLEX interdependencies, even if they could.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>e.1) Only on simple loops where no interdependencies are required.... like Arrays library Array/Collection pure-functional construction.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>f) Activities such as memory hoisting are done on this level, NOT on the processor level.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Explanation of f: just think about it, If there is NO specific instruction to promote or prevent register promotion on memories other than primitives on the <strong>processor level</strong>, then latency prevention can only be achieved in the compiler level via hoisting... WHILE actions like double-checking DO INVOLVE the processor since the processor has the means to reorder and simplify the code... damaging the double-check in the process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now let's examine the argument:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Ok, it works now, but... what about weakly memory ordered processors?&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems to me that <code>volatile</code> AND <code>getAcquire</code> loads are &quot;levers&quot; meant to handle COMPILER + processor reordering BEHAVIOR... volatile(<code>seq_const</code>) and acquire DO HAVE influence over previous and subsequent loads and stores....</p>\n<p>BUT <code>getOpaque</code>/<code>memory_ordered_relaxed</code> is JUST a compiler handle.... that does NOTHING on the processor level... depending on the case, either it be hoisting-prevention... or simplification-prevention.</p>\n<p>Since ALL it prevents is hoisting, then processors have no idea a <code>getOpaque</code> was even used...(?), depending on the case.</p>\n<p>The biggest clue about my assumption is the name the lynux kernel defines the fence... as <code>read_once()</code>, as to tell the compiler &quot;This will not be read more than once, please do NOT HOIST-optimize&quot;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>So, de-virtualization is a behavior that &quot;almost never happens&quot; according to some answers on this site, and even if it DOES, it will only occur on situations on which the scope is &quot;contextually aknowledged&quot;... aka private/protected methods (inheritance by extension...)</p>\n<p>This exempts:\npublic methods (relative to an outer scope), lambdas and static methods(not so sure about this one tbh).</p>\n<p>In the next code I will try to demonstrate how a specific syntax will prevent load hoisting, by taking advantage of method virtualization.\nNote: On double-checking getOpaque/relaxed is still required.</p>\n<p>IF... for the code:</p>\n<pre><code>   int plain = 0;\n   final Executor executor;\n\n   Runnable readRunnable = () -&gt;

The remote interface itself doesn&#39;t have any such magical property. All methods defined in a remote interface must be declared to throw `RemoteException,` although the implementations of these methods generally don&#39;t need to be so declared (i.e. unless they perform remote operations themselves: the compiler will tell you).\r\n\r\n&gt; We need class that create a Remote object&#39;s so we crate class object implement the Remote Interface to make the object&#39;s that created by this class object\r\n\r\nFar too much confusion here. We need a *class.* The *class* must implement the remote interface. This is not an &#39;object&#39; yet: it is a piece of code that must be compiled to a .class file. A class doesn&#39;t &#39;make objects&#39;. An application does that, with the `new` operator.\r\n\r\n&gt; we link this object&#39;s to the RMI System by extends from this class UnicastRemoteObjec so When a class extends from UnicastRemoteObject, it must provide a constructor declaring this constructor calls super(), it activates code in UnicastRemoteObject, which performs the RMI linking and remote object initialization\r\n\r\nThere is no &#39;link&#39; step in RMI. There is an &#39;export&#39; step. It is performed *either* by extending `UnicastRemoteObject` *or* by calling `UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject().` If you don&#39;t extend `UnicastRemoteObject` you don&#39;t need the constructor you described.\r\n\r\n&gt; The server&#39;s job is to accept requests from a client, perform some service, and then send the results back to the client.\r\n\r\nThe server&#39;s job is to implement the methods in the remote interface. RMI does all the rest for you.\r\n\r\n&gt; The server creates the remote object, registers it under some arbitrary name, then waits for remote requests\r\n\r\nThe server *is* the remote object. It can register itself.\r\n\r\n&gt;  for register The remote object we use java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry class allows the RMI registry service (provided as part of the JVM) to be started within the code by calling its createRegistry() method.\r\n\r\nOr you can use an external Registry via the `rmiregistry` command. Or you can use an LDAP server via JNDI.\r\n\r\n    LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099); \r\n    Naming.rebind(&quot;TheCalendar&quot;, \r\n                  new CalendarImpl()); \r\n\r\nThis won&#39;t work unless you store the result of `createRegistry()` into a static variable. And having stored it, you may as well *use* it to do the bind, instead of using the `Naming` class. If you don&#39;t store it into a static variable it will be garbage-collected and so will the remote object.\r\n\r\n&gt; The java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry class allows the RMI registry service to be located by a client by its getRegistry() method\r\n\r\nOr you can use the `Naming` class, see below.\r\n\r\n&gt; The java.rmi.registry.Registry class provides a lookup() method that takes the &quot;ArbitraryName&quot; the remote object was bound to by the server.\r\n\r\nSo does the `Naming` class. It takes an rmi: URL which specifies the host and port and bind-name. You can omit the `rmi://` part. If you omit the host it defaults to &#39;localhost&#39;, but this is only useful if the client is running in the same host as the server, which isn&#39;t itself very useful. If you omit the port it defaults to 1099.","title":"how to create rmi in java","body":"<p>The code you have written doesn't start a registry. <code>LocateRegistry.getRegistry()</code> doesn't do that.

All methods defined in a remote interface must be declared to throw <code>RemoteException,</code> although the implementations of these methods generally don't need to be so declared (i.e. unless they perform remote operations themselves: the compiler will tell you).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We need class that create a Remote object's so we crate class object implement the Remote Interface to make the object's that created by this class object</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Far too much confusion here. We need a <em>class.</em> The <em>class</em> must implement the remote interface. This is not an 'object' yet: it is a piece of code that must be compiled to a .class file. A class doesn't 'make objects'. An application does that, with the <code>new</code> operator.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>we link this object's to the RMI System by extends from this class UnicastRemoteObjec so When a class extends from UnicastRemoteObject, it must provide a constructor declaring this constructor calls super(), it activates code in UnicastRemoteObject, which performs the RMI linking and remote object initialization</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is no 'link' step in RMI. There is an 'export' step. It is performed <em>either</em> by extending <code>UnicastRemoteObject</code> <em>or</em> by calling <code>UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject().</code> If you don't extend <code>UnicastRemoteObject</code> you don't need the constructor you described.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The server's job is to accept requests from a client, perform some service, and then send the results back to the client.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The server's job is to implement the methods in the remote interface. RMI does all the rest for you.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The server creates the remote object, registers it under some arbitrary name, then waits for remote requests</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The server <em>is</em> the remote object. It can register itself.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>for register The remote object we use java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry class allows the RMI registry service (provided as part of the JVM) to be started within the code by calling its createRegistry() method.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or you can use an external Registry via the <code>rmiregistry</code> command. Or you can use an LDAP server via JNDI.</p>\n<pre><code>LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099); \nNaming.rebind(&quot;TheCalendar&quot;, \n              new CalendarImpl()); \n</code></pre>\n<p>This won't work unless you store the result of <code>createRegistry()</code> into a static variable. And having stored it, you may as well <em>use</em> it to do the bind, instead of using the <code>Naming</code> class. If you don't store it into a static variable it will be garbage-collected and so will the remote object.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry class allows the RMI registry service to be located by a client by its getRegistry() method</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or you can use the <code>Naming</code> class, see below.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The java.rmi.registry.Registry class provides a lookup() method that takes the &quot;ArbitraryName&quot; the remote object was bound to by the server.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So does the <code>Naming</code> class. It takes an rmi: URL which specifies the host and port and bind-name. You can omit the <code>rmi://</code> part. If you omit the host it defaults to 'localhost', but this is only useful if the client is running in the same host as the server, which isn't itself very useful. If you omit the port it defaults to 1099.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":2840581,"reputation":2340,"user_id":2440284,"accept_rate":46,"display_name":"Fadi"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":1,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":3978,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1386097513,"accepted_answer_id":20339784,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1699304029,"creation_date":1386015095,"question_id":20336933,"body_markdown":"hi i have searched the internet for a long time trying to find some thing that talk about how to start rmi registry in windows 7 using cmd so if any one know how to do that pleas let me to know how to do it or if any one can provide us a good link for that... thx in advance \r\n\r\nok thanx for all how answered my question when i asked the question i was not fully understand the RMI system or how it work but know i have good idea i will summarized this for provide all with an idea for the RMI system and if i have any mistake please correct me \r\n\r\nso \r\n\r\n\r\nRemote Interface:\r\n\r\n1.

Good tutorial [here][1]. Among other things it removes the need for you to take care and create dependencies for everything in your classes, It does this using using IoC (Inversion of Control). You create the rules and the container will then facilitate your needs by taking care of dependencies and creating objects when needed. These container managed objects are called Beans. This removes the need for using &#39;new&#39; and figuring our where to get the instance of an object in you own class. So DataSource db = new DataSource(&quot;all the parameters you need. What if this is production env?!?&quot;) becomes essentially DataSource db = context.getBean(MySpecializedDataSource.class); and Spring decides according to your configuration and properties what instance to get for you.\r\n\r\nLets say you are creating a servlet that responds to HTTP requests and gets data from a database. Normally you would do everything by hand and extend HttpServlet and implement your logic in `doGet()` and `doPost()`. Then you would create a jdbc connection and get the data you need.

I have done J2EE programming back in the day for banks and such, so I got something like 7 years of Java experience in my pocket. When I was doing stuff there were Annotations in Java, but nobody was using them. There was no enum yet. So now ~20 years later I needed some software to automate a company&#39;s business. &quot;I can do it myself with Java!&quot; I thought and Googling around a bit I found out that Spring and Spring Boot is the way to go. Now after a week I finally got the Spring Boot Maven project to compile. I think I understand some of the methodology now. I don&#39;t know if the code actually runs, I wrote it as I undertand the Spring concept\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/spring-framework\r\n","title":"What in the world are Spring beans?","body":"<p>Spring is a Java framework that facilitates for many needs and links to Spring are already posted in other answers, so I will not repost them here.

I have done J2EE programming back in the day for banks and such, so I got something like 7 years of Java experience in my pocket. When I was doing stuff there were Annotations in Java, but nobody was using them. There was no enum yet. So now ~20 years later I needed some software to automate a company's business. &quot;I can do it myself with Java!&quot; I thought and Googling around a bit I found out that Spring and Spring Boot is the way to go. Now after a week I finally got the Spring Boot Maven project to compile. I think I understand some of the methodology now. I don't know if the code actually runs, I wrote it as I undertand the Spring concept</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3347768,"reputation":405,"user_id":2812560,"display_name":"Okpo"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1699299992,"creation_date":1699299992,"answer_id":77433860,"question_id":17193365,"body_markdown":"According to the Spring Documentation, &quot;...A bean definition is essentially a recipe for creating one or more objects.

Also you need to use an interceptor for basic authentication for Retrofit.</p>\n<p>I tried to find that information in documentation , but unfortunately i can't\nalso i asked to ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>Here code .</p>\n<p><code>data class LoginRequest(val username: String, val password: String) </code></p>\n<p>`interface GitHubService {</p>\n<pre><code>@POST(&quot;authorizations&quot;)    \n@Headers(&quot;Accept: application/json&quot;)\n    fun login(@Header(&quot;Authorization&quot;) authHeader: String,@Body loginRequest: LoginRequest):Call&lt;YourResponseModel&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>}`</p>\n<pre><code>private fun doRequest() {\n        val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()\n            .baseUrl(&quot;https://api.github.com/&quot;)\n            .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())\n            .build()\n\n        val githubService = retrofit.create(GitHubService::class.java)\n\n        val emailOrUsername = binding?.editTextText?.text.toString()\n        val password = binding?.editTextTextPassword?.text.toString()\n        val authHeader = &quot;Basic &quot; + Base64.encodeToString(\n            &quot;$emailOrUsername:$password&quot;.toByteArray(), Base64.NO_WRAP\n        )\n\n        val loginRequest = LoginRequest(emailOrUsername, password)\n\n        githubService.login(authHeader, loginRequest).enqueue(object : Callback&lt;YourResponseModel&gt; {\n            override fun onResponse(call: Call&lt;YourResponseModel&gt;, response: Response&lt;YourResponseModel&gt;) {\n                if (response.isSuccessful) {\n                    // Authentication successful\n                    // Store the logged-in state here\n                } else {\n                    // Authentication failed, show a Snackbar\n                    Snackbar.make(rootView, &quot;Invalid credentials&quot;, Snackbar.LENGTH_SHORT).show()\n                }\n            }\n\n            override fun onFailure(call: Call&lt;YourResponseModel&gt;, t: Throwable) {\n                // Handle network or other errors\n            }\n        })\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case , i can't get request model , also i can't get correct response with Postman</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","keycloak"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4028001,"reputation":91,"user_id":5753259,"display_name":"Marius"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1642168501,"creation_date":1642168501,"answer_id":70711673,"question_id":58005895,"body_markdown":"The URL in your example contains an UUID which is valid only once, thus there is a reload of the page.\r\n\r\nI was successful using a registration URL like this:\r\n\r\n    https://&lt;your_host&gt;/auth/realms/&lt;your_realm&gt;/protocol/openid-connect/registrations?client_id=&lt;your_client&gt;&amp;response_type=code&amp;scope=openid%20email&amp;redirect_uri=&lt;your_host&gt;\r\n\r\nBtw. some GET parameter names are not permitted, e.g. the name &quot;ref&quot; seems to be reserved.","title":"Is it possible to add custom GET parameters in Keycloak registration page","body":"<p>The URL in your example contains an UUID which is valid only once, thus there is a reload of the page.</p>\n<p>I was successful using a registration URL like this:</p>\n<pre><code>https://&lt;your_host&gt;/auth/realms/&lt;your_realm&gt;/protocol/openid-connect/registrations?client_id=&lt;your_client&gt;&amp;response_type=code&amp;scope=openid%20email&amp;redirect_uri=&lt;your_host&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Btw. some GET parameter names are not permitted, e.g. the name &quot;ref&quot; seems to be reserved.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":83131,"reputation":8752,"user_id":233286,"accept_rate":73,"display_name":"ilhan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":1738,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":9,"answer_count":1,"score":9,"last_activity_date":1699295224,"creation_date":1568878234,"question_id":58005895,"body_markdown":"I have created a custom field in Keycloak registration form that I can fill it automatically with a JavaScript code that takes it from the GET parameter in the url.

Use `synchronized` only around brief code that does not block, such as checking guards in memory. \r\n\r\n## Just one lock, but not really a singleton\r\n\r\n&gt;Getting Java locks on a singleton class, understanding why\r\n\r\nNot &quot;locks&quot; plural, but singular. There is only a single lock in your code, from this line: &quot;synchronized (logfiles) {&quot;. \r\n\r\n&gt;The locks are on the singleton class.\r\n\r\nThe lock is *not* on your `SomeSingleton` class, if that is what your meant by &quot;the singleton class&quot;. The lock is on the `Properties` object held in `logfiles` object. \r\n\r\n&gt;`SomeSingleton`\r\n\r\nYour class is not actually a singleton, as explained in [Answer by Eggen][1]. \r\n\r\nYou have a race condition, where multiple threads could be accessing your `getInstance` method and read a `null` before you have finished assigning an instance to `SomeSingleton instance`. At runtime, your code could actually instantiate more than one `SomeSingleton` objects.\r\n\r\nPlus, `SomeSingleton instance` should be `private` rather than `public` if you intend access to go through `getInstance`. \r\n\r\n## Revamped, with private constructor\r\n\r\nYou need to revamp that code. I would change it around to make a single instance available through a `public final` object reference, and make the constructor private to assure no inadvertent instantiations take place. \r\n\r\nChange this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class SomeSingleton {\r\n\r\n  private static final Thing object = new Thing();\r\n\r\n    public static SomeSingleton instance = null;    \r\n\r\n    private final Properties logfiles = new Properties();\r\n\r\n    public static SomeSingleton getInstance() {\r\n        if (instance == null) {\r\n            createInstance();\r\n        }\r\n        return instance;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n \r\n    /**\r\n     * Imagine this method called\r\n     * SomeSingleton.getInstance().log()\r\n     */\r\n    public void log(final String message) {\r\n        try {\r\n            synchronized (logfiles) {\r\n            }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n… to the following.\r\n\r\nWe mark `instance` as `public` because this is our designated access route for calling methods. \r\n\r\nWe mark `instance` as `final` to prevent re-assignment to another object.\r\n\r\nWe re-org our `static` vars together for clarity.\r\n\r\nWe add a constructor, making it `private` to avoid uncontrolled instantiation. \r\n\r\nWe initialize `logfiles` in the constructor, rather than on the declaration line, as a matter of style. Some folks like me want to see all the initialization for this object in one place, not scattered amongst declaration lines. Reasonable people may disagree.\r\n\r\nThis code instantiates `instance` in the static declaration, `… instance = new SomeSingleton();`. We no longer need your `getInstance` method. This instantiation occurs when the class loads. The `instance` field is marked `final` to prevent any other instance from being assigned. \r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class SomeSingleton \r\n{\r\n    // Statics.\r\n    public static final SomeSingleton instance = new SomeSingleton();\r\n    private static final Thing thing = new Thing();  \r\n\r\n    // Member fields.\r\n    private final Properties logfiles;  // To enable logging.\r\n    \r\n    // Private constructor.\r\n    private SomeSingleton() \r\n    {\r\n        this.logfiles = new Properties() ;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Perform logging by calling:\r\n     * SomeSingleton.instance.log( … )\r\n     */\r\n    public void log( final String message ) \r\n    {\r\n        synchronized ( this.logfiles ) \r\n        {\r\n            …  \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## `ReentrantLock` rather than `synchronized` for virtual threads\r\n\r\nFor compatibility with [virtual threads][2] in [Java 21][3]+, we replace `synchronized` with a [`ReentrantLock`][4] object.\r\n\r\nDo this only if (a) the work being performed is not entirely [CPU-bound][5] (involves blocking), and (b) takes a while to execute. If short-lived, just use `synchronized`. Pinning the virtual thread is not a problem for a mere moment. \r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class SomeSingleton \r\n{\r\n    // Statics.\r\n    public static final SomeSingleton instance = new SomeSingleton();\r\n    private static final Thing thing = new Thing();  \r\n\r\n    // Member fields.\r\n    private final Properties logfiles;  // To enable logging.\r\n    private final Lock loggingLock;  // To protect logging.\r\n    \r\n    // Private constructor.\r\n    private SomeSingleton() \r\n    {\r\n        this.logfiles = new Properties() ;\r\n        this.loggingLock = new ReentrantLock();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Perform logging by calling:\r\n     * SomeSingleton.instance.log( … )\r\n     */\r\n    public void log( final String message ) \r\n    {\r\n        this.loggingLock.lock();  // Blocks until lock becomes available.\r\n        try \r\n        {\r\n            …  // Involves blocking, such as I/O.\r\n        } \r\n        finally \r\n        {\r\n            this.loggingLock.unlock();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Singleton as `enum`\r\n\r\nBut even this is not ideal. Singleton pattern is surprisingly tricky business! \r\n\r\nCurrent wisdom is that a singleton in Java is generally best implemented as an `enum`. For more info, see:\r\n\r\n - The book [*Effective Java*](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/effective-java/P200000000138) by [Dr. Joshua Bloch][6]. \r\n - This Question, [*Implementing Singleton with an Enum (in Java)*][7]\r\n\r\nAn enum is implicitly `static` and `final`, no need to add those modifiers.\r\n\r\nIn transforming to an enum, we can delete the line: `public static final SomeSingleton instance = new SomeSingleton();`. The named enum object populates (the instantiation of our singleton) when the class loads, just the same as our `static` field did as mentioned above.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic enum SomeSingleton \r\n{\r\n    // enum\r\n    INSTANCE ;\r\n\r\n    // Statics.\r\n    private static final Thing thing = new Thing();  \r\n\r\n    // Member fields.\r\n    private final Properties logfiles;  // To enable logging.\r\n    private final Lock loggingLock;  // To protect logging.\r\n    \r\n    // Private constructor.\r\n    private SomeSingleton() \r\n    {\r\n        this.logfiles = new Properties() ;\r\n        this.loggingLock = new ReentrantLock();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Perform logging by calling:\r\n     * SomeSingleton.INSTANCE.log( … )\r\n     */\r\n    public void log( final String message ) \r\n    {\r\n        this.loggingLock.lock();  // Blocks until lock becomes available.\r\n        try \r\n        {\r\n            …  // Involves blocking, such as I/O.\r\n        } \r\n        finally \r\n        {\r\n            this.loggingLock.unlock();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/77352937/642706\r\n  [2]: https://openjdk.org/jeps/444\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_21\r\n  [4]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs//api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock.html\r\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU-bound\r\n  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Bloch\r\n  [7]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/26285520/642706","title":"Getting Java locks on a singleton class, understanding why","body":"<h1>tl;dr</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Define your singleton as an <code>enum</code>.</li>\n<li>Use virtual threads if your code involves blocking (if your code is not CPU-bound).\n<ul>\n<li>Protect thread-unsafe resources with a <code>ReentrantLock</code> in long-running (blocking) code.

From my understanding there are multiple golang build packs being used in the process of image building.\r\n\r\nNo, that&#39;s not correct. When you build a Java app, it only uses the Java-related buildpacks. It does not use any Go buildpacks. You can see in the output of your build the list of buildpacks it utilizes. It&#39;ll look something like this. The buildpacks listed in DETECTING are the *only* buildpacks that get invoked.\r\n\r\n```\r\n===&gt; DETECTING\r\n6 of 26 buildpacks participating\r\npaketo-buildpacks/ca-certificates   3.6.6\r\npaketo-buildpacks/bellsoft-liberica 10.4.2\r\npaketo-buildpacks/syft              1.39.0\r\npaketo-buildpacks/executable-jar    6.8.2\r\npaketo-buildpacks/dist-zip          5.6.7\r\npaketo-buildpacks/spring-boot       5.27.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat you might be confusing here is that *all* of the Paketo buildpacks themselves are written in Golang. So if you were to pick a buildpack image, like `gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/bellsoft-liberica`, you would see that there is a Go binary at `/cnb/buildpacks/paketo-buildpacks_bellsoft-liberica/10.4.2/bin/main`. This is what gets invoked during detect and build, and what actually performs the operations of the buildpack. \r\n\r\nIn addition, there are actions that the buildpack executes before your application starts at runtime, for example configuring JVM settings, and these are performed by a separate binary called `helper` (same directory of the buildpack image). This binary, unlike `main`, is copied into the final image, so your scanner is correct that there is a Go binary in the image. It is the `helper` binary. If you look at your app image with `dive`, you can see the layer that adds the `helper` binary and confirm this.\r\n\r\nYour scanner will see this binary and scan it like everything else. It is able to tell from the binary what version of Golang created the binary, and from there it will tell you that the binary file is potentially vulnerable to *any* known CVEs for that version of Go or greater.\r\n\r\nThe scanner has zero context on what the binary does or whether it&#39;s actually vulnerable to any of the CVEs though. I do not know what CVEs you&#39;re referring to, but I can tell you that given the context of Paketo buildpack `helper` binaries, most CVEs will not be applicable. For example, anything that&#39;s related to a server, networking, or HTTP is not relevant. The `helper` binary is a CLI that runs and typically reads arguments/environment variables and then prints out some structured text. That&#39;s it, typically no servers, networking, or HTTP.\r\n\r\nIf you have *specific* questions about a CVE and its impact, you can ask on the Paketo Slack but do not just dump the list of CVEs from your scanner there and expect someone to go through them all for you.

the user.\r\n- Convert Hexcode to RGB values: Extract the Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha (if available) components from the Hexcode.\r\n- Create an Image: Use the RGB values to create an image in memory.\r\n- Save as JPG/PNG: Save the generated image as a JPG or PNG file.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Question:** How can I achieve my goal of converting this Hexcode to a JPG or PNG file? &lt;br&gt;\r\n**Additionally:** Is there a specific file format that comes to mind when you see this hexcode?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/lajeO.png","title":"Convert .GRF to Image File

But if the thread is interrupted during sleep, JVM is so kind it will inform you about by throwing <code>InterruptedException</code> out of <code>sleep()</code>. Catch it and break your loop.

The dictionary name is no longer hard-coded, so users should be able to dynamically specify it during agent configuration. The problem is that after the changes, the agent stil did not recognize other dictionaries. I guess this problem is extremely simple, but I would still appreciate any help.","title":"Creating a universal agent in a Java Agent Development Framework (JADE)","body":"<p>I'm new to JADE and have recently created a Service agent that looks up the definition of words from two dictionaries (WordNet(r) 3.0 (2006) and Easton's 1897 Bible Dictionary).\nI want to merge all services and behaviors of ServiceAgent into one.
