In it, you are only comparing one column with the value from the other column.  In the case of your first example, Each value from column 2 `{5,2,9,5,4}` exists only once in column 1 `{5,7,4,9,2}`.  Even though 5 appears twice in column 2, it only appears once in column 1.  Therefore, the conditional `!= 1` passes for both instances of 5 in column 2.\r\n\r\nYou can fix this easily enough by extending your code to repeat the check in the opposite direction\r\n```java\r\npublic static boolean similarColumns(int[][] similar, int col1, int col2) {\r\n  boolean isSimilar = true;\r\n  for (int[] ints : similar) {\r\n    if (numInColumn(similar, col1, ints[col2]) != 1 &amp;&amp; numInColumn(similar, col2, ints[col1]) != 1) {\r\n      isSimilar = false;\r\n      break;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return isSimilar;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are able to use non-primitive Objects and types, you can also accomplish this fairly easily without loops using the Java8 Stream api.

In particular, the names of reference types (classes and interfaces) should begin with capital letters (e.g. <code>List</code>) whereas the names of methods and instance variables should begin with lowercase letters.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some comments on your non-working method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void rev(list lst,list lst1)\n{\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is pointless to pass lst1 if you are immediately going to discard whatever value was passed, as you do here:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    lst1=null;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is also pointless to initialize variable 'ptr' here, as the very first thing you do with it (at the beginning of the loop) is assign a new value.  In fact, it would be cleaner to declare it inside the loop body.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    list ptr=new list();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The following loop looks like it's probably ok, but consider the state in which it leaves the object initially referenced by the <code>lst</code>.  Hint: <code>lst1</code> is initialized to <code>null</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    while(lst!=null)\n    {\n        ptr =lst;\n        lst=lst.l;\n        ptr.l=lst1;\n        lst1=ptr;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now consider that Java has only pass-by-value, so whatever references are passed to this method are not changed from the invoker's perspective.</p>\n\n<pre><code>}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you're still not seeing it, then consider this question: which node is now at the head of the list?</p>\n\n<p>In a more general sense, you have a bit of a modelling problem in that your <code>list</code> class tries to do double duty representing not only an overall list but also a node in that list.  That can work, and it has properties that could be useful, but it also has properties that can cause trouble.  For instance, you cannot represent an empty list with an instance of your class.  You also cannot usefully reverse a list represented by an instance of your class via a method having the signature of your <code>rev()</code>.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":124783,"reputation":4934,"user_id":320104,"accept_rate":79,"display_name":"WBAR"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1415207539,"creation_date":1415207539,"answer_id":26763098,"question_id":26761714,"body_markdown":"Using

But if I delete the configuration class (so I don&#39;t configure the ThreadPoolTaskExecutor bean), the app compiles and runs perfectly, but I see in the logs that it uses only one thread:\r\n\r\n    2022-10-09 18:50:56.027  INFO [accounts,27e5f8bb1b00cda3,27e5f8bb1b00cda3] 2396 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] c.d.b.a.s.client.RetrieveDetailsAsync    : Attempting to retr\r\n    ieve accounts details, thread =  http-nio-8080-exec-1\r\n    Hibernate: select accounts0_.account_number as account_1_0_, accounts0_.account_type as account_2_0_, accounts0_.branch_address as branch_a3_0_, accounts0_.create_\r\n    dt as create_d4_0_, accounts0_.customer_id as customer5_0_ from accounts accounts0_ where accounts0_.customer_id=?\r\n    2022-10-09 18:50:56.341  INFO [accounts,27e5f8bb1b00cda3,27e5f8bb1b00cda3] 2396 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] c.d.b.a.s.client.RetrieveDetailsAsync    : Attempting to retr\r\n    ieve loans details, thread =  http-nio-8080-exec-1\r\n    2022-10-09 18:50:57.701  INFO [accounts,27e5f8bb1b00cda3,27e5f8bb1b00cda3] 2396 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] c.d.b.a.s.client.RetrieveDetailsAsync    : Attempting to retr\r\n    ieve cards details, thread =  http-nio-8080-exec-1\r\n\r\nIt look s that it creates and uses only one thread. So the 3 requests aren&#39;t done concurrently? From my research I understand that if I don&#39;t configure this ThreadPoolTaskExecutor bean, it will use SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor by default. If there is only one thread http-nio-8080-exec-1, does this mean that first request uses this thread, after the request is finished, the second request uses the same thread and after that the third request uses the same thread. So the request aren&#39;t done concurrently? \r\n\r\nAnd another question is about ThreadPoolExecutor (the implementation for ExecutorService interface). What exactly is the difference between ThreadPoolTaskExecutor and ThreadPoolExecutor. Is the difference only the fact that the first is from spring framework and the second is from JEE? Because I see that both uses tasks concurrently? And because ThreadPoolTaskExecutor is from Spring framework, it is better to use it in Spring Boot projects. Thank you for response! ","title":"Does SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor use only one thread without concurrency in Spring Boot?","body":"<p>I'm learning about ThreadPoolTaskExecutor in Spring Boot Microservice.

But if I delete the configuration class (so I don't configure the ThreadPoolTaskExecutor bean), the app compiles and runs perfectly, but I see in the logs that it uses only one thread:</p>\n<pre><code>2022-10-09 18:50:56.027  INFO [accounts,27e5f8bb1b00cda3,27e5f8bb1b00cda3] 2396 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] c.d.b.a.s.client.RetrieveDetailsAsync    : Attempting to retr\nieve accounts details, thread =  http-nio-8080-exec-1\nHibernate: select accounts0_.account_number as account_1_0_, accounts0_.account_type as account_2_0_, accounts0_.branch_address as branch_a3_0_, accounts0_.create_\ndt as create_d4_0_, accounts0_.customer_id as customer5_0_ from accounts accounts0_ where accounts0_.customer_id=?\n2022-10-09 18:50:56.341  INFO [accounts,27e5f8bb1b00cda3,27e5f8bb1b00cda3] 2396 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] c.d.b.a.s.client.RetrieveDetailsAsync    : Attempting to retr\nieve loans details, thread =  http-nio-8080-exec-1\n2022-10-09 18:50:57.701  INFO [accounts,27e5f8bb1b00cda3,27e5f8bb1b00cda3] 2396 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] c.d.b.a.s.client.RetrieveDetailsAsync    : Attempting to retr\nieve cards details, thread =  http-nio-8080-exec-1\n</code></pre>\n<p>It look s that it creates and uses only one thread. So the 3 requests aren't done concurrently? From my research I understand that if I don't configure this ThreadPoolTaskExecutor bean, it will use SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor by default. If there is only one thread http-nio-8080-exec-1, does this mean that first request uses this thread, after the request is finished, the second request uses the same thread and after that the third request uses the same thread. So the request aren't done concurrently?</p>\n<p>And another question is about ThreadPoolExecutor (the implementation for ExecutorService interface). What exactly is the difference between ThreadPoolTaskExecutor and ThreadPoolExecutor. Is the difference only the fact that the first is from spring framework and the second is from JEE? Because I see that both uses tasks concurrently? And because ThreadPoolTaskExecutor is from Spring framework, it is better to use it in Spring Boot projects. Thank you for response!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":6897165,"reputation":7367,"user_id":5298696,"display_name":"CollinD"},"score":5,"creation_date":1671133536,"post_id":74816767,"comment_id":132038744,"body_markdown":"What are you expecting as output?

I already know a decent amount of Javascript and so i was trying to apply that knowledge to java. So everything has been working so far except one thing: Prompting a user for a choice. So read online that i have to import a scanner so i did that as you can see from my code. I also tried some code where you can have the user import a string but you can see a bit later in my program i change the variable userChoice into a number. So basically i just need help with this. If there is some way to have a variable type that can store both numbers or strings that would be best. But im tottaly open to other ways of doing this! Thanks in advanced!
