Each element in the list is an integer within the range [0....70,000]</p>\n<p>I am not being lazy, here's my incorrect attempt:</p>\n<pre><code>public static int getMinimumFilters(double[] pollutionLevels) {\n    double totalPollution = Arrays.stream(pollutionLevels).sum();\n    double targetPollution = totalPollution / 2.0;\n    int numFilters = 0;\n    double currentPollution = 0;\n    double tempPollution = 0;\n\n    Arrays.sort(pollutionLevels);\n\n    for (double i = pollutionLevels.length -1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\n        currentPollution = (totalPollution - pollutionLevels[(int) i]) + pollutionLevels[(int) i]/2;\n        numFilters++;\n        if (currentPollution &lt;= targetPollution) {\n            break;\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return numFilters;\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    double[] pollutionLevels = {3, 5, 6, 1, 18};\n    System.out.println(&quot;Minimum number of filters needed: &quot; + getMinimumFilters(pollutionLevels));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>My next line of thought was to sum the array and then use the difference between the sum and the targetPollution value to somehow check which array values should be halved to achieve the target.</p>\n<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","user-interface","javafx"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":26879624,"reputation":386,"user_id":20460294,"display_name":"Anon"},"score":0,"creation_date":1685994045,"post_id":76408759,"comment_id":134735925,"body_markdown":"`stage.setScene(new Scene(new Pane(), 200, 200));` write this before the `stage.show();` for more info https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/get_started/hello_world.htm","body":"<code>stage.setScene(new Scene(new Pane(), 200, 200));</code> write this before the <code>stage.show();</code> for more info <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/get_started/hello_world.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/get_started/hello_world.htm</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":2819940,"reputation":12538,"user_id":2423906,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"SedJ601"},"score":1,"creation_date":1685994710,"post_id":76408759,"comment_id":134736029,"body_markdown":"https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/","body":"<a href=\"https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">openjfx.io/openjfx-docs</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":81822,"reputation":204250,"user_id":230513,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"trashgod"},"score":0,"creation_date":1686156218,"post_id":76408759,"comment_id":134761616,"body_markdown":"The code runs correctly rom the command line.","body":"The code runs correctly rom the command line."}],"owner":{"account_id":26410559,"reputation":19,"user_id":20059702,"display_name":"Mathayel"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1685986214,"creation_date":1685986214,"question_id":76408759,"body_markdown":"I have a Mac OS (Version: 12.6.5) and I downloaded javaFX to work on GUI applications.

Here is the error message:</p>\n<pre><code>Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 26 &gt; 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is the function with the problem:</p>\n<pre><code>public void generateRows() {\n    setRowCount(0);\n    int cont = 0;\n    for (Object obj : productos) {\n        addRow(obtenerAtributosProducto((ProductoComida) obj));\n        cont++;\n    }\n    setRowCount(cont);\n}\nprivate Object[] obtenerAtributosProducto(ProductoComida producto) {\n    /*\n     *Los atributos se obtendrán en el siguiente orden:  &quot;Id&quot;, &quot;Nombre&quot;,\n     *  &quot;Precio&quot;, &quot;Marca&quot;\n     * , &quot;Calificación&quot; \n     * */\n\n\n    rowData[0] = producto.obtenerId().toString();\n    rowData[1] = producto.obtenerNombre();\n    rowData[2] = producto.obtenerPrecio();\n    rowData[3] = producto.obtenerMarca();\n    rowData[4] = producto.obtenerCalificacion();\n    rowData[5] = &quot;Here is a panel&quot;;\n\n    return rowData;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the rest of the code:</p>\n<pre><code>public class ComprarComidaTableModel extends DefaultTableModel {\nprivate static final String[] titles = {\n        &quot;Id&quot;, &quot;Nombre&quot;,  &quot;Precio&quot;, &quot;Marca&quot;\n        , &quot;Calificación&quot;, &quot;Opciones&quot;\n};//La última fila es la fila del botón, la cantidad, y obtener más información del producto.\n\nprivate Inventario inventario = new Inventario();;\nprivate Object[] productos;\nprivate String filtro;\nprivate Object[] rowData = new Object[6];\n\npublic ComprarComidaTableModel() {\n    super(0, 0);\n    this.productos = inventario.obtenerCatComida().obtenerProductos();\n    generateColumns(); \n    generateRows(); //This method is the problem\n    this.filtro = &quot;Ninguno&quot;;\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I know that I don't need to do this for a single table, but I have to do almost 3 tables like this and I think this is the best way to simplify the code.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","eclipse","xsd","xsd-validation"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1937747,"reputation":14200,"user_id":1744774,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Gerold Broser"},"score":0,"creation_date":1686111664,"post_id":76408080,"comment_id":134752740,"body_markdown":"Perhaps this helps: [_How to solve this error : src-resolve: Cannot resolve the name &#39;j2ee:descriptionType&#39; to a(n) &#39;type definition&#39; component.?_](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9945668/1744774)","body":"Perhaps this helps: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/9945668/1744774\"><i>How to solve this error : src-resolve: Cannot resolve the name &#39;j2ee:descriptionType&#39; to a(n) &#39;type definition&#39; component.?</i></a>"}],"owner":{"account_id":18177895,"reputation":53,"user_id":14342895,"display_name":"NoobCoder"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1685980118,"creation_date":1685980118,"question_id":76408080,"body_markdown":"I am getting this error when validating my schema\r\nBelow I have attached both xsds.

All projects has one separated build configuration.\r\n\r\nNow I want to combine four separate projects into one and divide them using modules in this structure:\r\n\r\n- {parent} &lt;- `pom`\r\n- data &lt;- `jar`, executable\r\n- commons &lt;- `jar`, libraries, not executable\r\n- backend &lt;- `jar`, executable\r\n- infrastructure &lt;- `jar`, libraries, not executable\r\n\r\nNow I&#39;m not sure how the module build works in this multi module project.

Additionally, a quick internet search also led me to a that question, which was not as comprehensive as it could be (in my opinion). I noticed that in many cases, people suggest using the `maven-assembly-plugin`, `maven-shade-plugin`, and sometimes the `onejar-maven-plugin` to create multiple `jar`s. However, there is one more way to achieve this by using the simple `maven-jar-plugin`, which I&#39;ll describe in detail below.\r\n\r\n___\r\n# All possible solutions\r\n\r\nHere is a short description of the plugins that you can use to assemble your program into several `jar` archives (I obtained most of the information directly from the official sites):\r\n\r\n## maven-assembly-plugin \r\nThe Assembly Plugin for Maven enables developers to combine project output into a single distributable archive that also contains dependencies, modules, site documentation, and other files. Currently it can create distributions in the following formats: `zip`, `tar`, `tar.gz`, `tar.bz2`, `tar.snappy`, `tar.xz`, `tar.zst`, `jar`, `dir`, `war`. If your project wants to package your artifact in an [uber-jar](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11947037/what-is-an-uber-jar), the assembly plugin provides only basic support. For more control, use the [Maven Shade Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/). You can read more about `maven-assembly-plugin` right [here](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## maven-shade-plugin\r\nThis plugin provides the capability to package the artifact in an `uber-jar`, including its dependencies and to shade - i.e. rename - the packages of some of the dependencies. You can read more about shading [here](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/297276/what-is-a-shaded-java-dependency) and about the plugin itself right[here](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/).\r\n\r\n## maven-jar-plugin\r\nThis plugin provides the capability to build `jar`s. That&#39;s its primary purpose, and it doesn&#39;t offer any additional functionality beyond that. You can read more about `maven-jar-plugin` right [here](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-jar-plugin/). \r\n\r\n## onejar-maven-plugin\r\nThis is an unofficial plugin that enables you to build an executable `jar` with Maven 2, including all dependencies. Here is a [helpful answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9126300/10423604) that explains how you can use it. However, it&#39;s important to note that the latest version of the plugin was released on December 13, 2011, which means that it might be outdated.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the `maven-assembly-plugin` is a widely used plugin with extensive settings for adjusting project aspects. For greater control in creating fat `jar`&#39;s with dependencies and package shading for multiple library versions, the `maven-shade-plugin` is recommended. The `maven-jar-plugin` serves as a lightweight and efficient solution for building multiple `jar`s without additional functionality, making it suitable for many cases. However, it&#39;s best to avoid using the outdated `onejar-maven-plugin`.\r\n___\r\n\r\n# The usage of `maven-jar-plugin` \r\n\r\nThe usage of the `maven-assembly-plugin` and `maven-shade-plugin` was well described in [that](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15798936/creating-two-executable-jars-using-maven-assembly-plugin) thread and in [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8726884/create-multiple-runnable-jars-with-dependencies-included-from-a-single-maven-p) question. Here, I will provide some examples of how to create multiple `jar`s by using the simple and lightweight `maven-jar-plugin`. For example, you can define it as follows: \r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;plugin&gt;\r\n  &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-jar-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n  &lt;version&gt;3.3.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n  &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n    &lt;finalName&gt;\r\n      my-application\r\n    &lt;/finalName&gt;\r\n  &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n  &lt;executions&gt;\r\n    &lt;execution&gt;\r\n      &lt;id&gt;production&lt;/id&gt;\r\n      &lt;phase&gt;package&lt;/phase&gt;\r\n      &lt;goals&gt;\r\n        &lt;goal&gt;jar&lt;/goal&gt;\r\n      &lt;/goals&gt;\r\n      &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n        &lt;classifier&gt;production&lt;/classifier&gt;\r\n        &lt;archive&gt;\r\n          &lt;manifest&gt;\r\n            &lt;mainClass&gt;\r\n              org.example.Production\r\n            &lt;/mainClass&gt;\r\n          &lt;/manifest&gt;\r\n        &lt;/archive&gt;\r\n      &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n    &lt;/execution&gt;\r\n    &lt;execution&gt;\r\n      &lt;id&gt;staging&lt;/id&gt;\r\n      &lt;phase&gt;package&lt;/phase&gt;\r\n      &lt;goals&gt;\r\n        &lt;goal&gt;jar&lt;/goal&gt;\r\n      &lt;/goals&gt;\r\n      &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n        &lt;classifier&gt;staging&lt;/classifier&gt;\r\n        &lt;archive&gt;\r\n          &lt;manifest&gt;\r\n            &lt;mainClass&gt;\r\n              org.example.Staging\r\n            &lt;/mainClass&gt;\r\n          &lt;/manifest&gt;\r\n        &lt;/archive&gt;\r\n      &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n    &lt;/execution&gt;\r\n    &lt;execution&gt;\r\n      &lt;id&gt;testing&lt;/id&gt;\r\n      &lt;phase&gt;package&lt;/phase&gt;\r\n      &lt;goals&gt;\r\n        &lt;goal&gt;jar&lt;/goal&gt;\r\n      &lt;/goals&gt;\r\n      &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n        &lt;classifier&gt;testing&lt;/classifier&gt;\r\n        &lt;archive&gt;\r\n          &lt;manifest&gt;\r\n            &lt;mainClass&gt;\r\n              org.example.Testing\r\n            &lt;/mainClass&gt;\r\n          &lt;/manifest&gt;\r\n        &lt;/archive&gt;\r\n      &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n    &lt;/execution&gt;\r\n  &lt;/executions&gt;\r\n&lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAfter executing the `mvn package` command, you will find three different `jar`&#39;s in the `target` directory, each of which has its own main class:\r\n\r\n*  `my-application-production.jar` - the main class is `org.example.Production`\r\n*  `my-application-staging.jar` - the main class is `org.example.Staging`\r\n*  `my-application-testing.jar` - the main class is `org.example.Testing`\r\n \r\nHence, when you run `java -jar target/my-application-staging.jar`, the `org.example.Staging` class will be invoked.\r\nHowever, there is one trick - the `maven-jar-plugin` only packs your classes into a `jar` archive without adding the dependencies.\r\nIf you need to include dependencies in the `jar`, such as when creating an executable `jar`, you will likely need to use the `maven-dependency-plugin` in conjunction with the `maven-jar-plugin`:\r\n\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;plugin&gt;\r\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-dependency-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    &lt;version&gt;3.6.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n    &lt;executions&gt;\r\n        &lt;execution&gt;\r\n            &lt;id&gt;dependencies&lt;/id&gt;\r\n            &lt;phase&gt;prepare-package&lt;/phase&gt;\r\n            &lt;goals&gt;\r\n                &lt;goal&gt;copy-dependencies&lt;/goal&gt;\r\n            &lt;/goals&gt;\r\n            &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n                &lt;outputDirectory&gt;\r\n                    ${project.build.directory}/deps\r\n                &lt;/outputDirectory&gt;\r\n            &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n        &lt;/execution&gt;\r\n    &lt;/executions&gt;\r\n&lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, in `maven-jar-plugin` you will have to specify the classpath properties:\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;plugin&gt;\r\n  &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-jar-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n  &lt;version&gt;3.3.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n  &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n    &lt;finalName&gt;\r\n      my-application\r\n    &lt;/finalName&gt;\r\n  &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n  &lt;executions&gt;\r\n    &lt;execution&gt;\r\n      &lt;id&gt;production&lt;/id&gt;\r\n      &lt;phase&gt;package&lt;/phase&gt;\r\n      &lt;goals&gt;\r\n        &lt;goal&gt;jar&lt;/goal&gt;\r\n      &lt;/goals&gt;\r\n      &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n        &lt;classifier&gt;production&lt;/classifier&gt;\r\n        &lt;archive&gt;\r\n          &lt;manifest&gt;\r\n            &lt;mainClass&gt;\r\n              org.example.Production\r\n            &lt;/mainClass&gt;\r\n            &lt;addClasspath&gt;true&lt;/addClasspath&gt;\r\n            &lt;classpathPrefix&gt;deps/&lt;/classpathPrefix&gt;\r\n          &lt;/manifest&gt;\r\n        &lt;/archive&gt;\r\n      &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n    &lt;/execution&gt;\r\n  &lt;/executions&gt;\r\n&lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n```\r\nPlease note that we have added the `addClasspath` and `classpathPrefix` properties to the `maven-jar-plugin`. It is important to ensure that the name of the directory set in the `outputDirectory` of the `maven-dependency-plugin` matches the name specified in the `classpathPrefix` property of the `maven-jar-plugin`\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s all. I hope it will be helpful to someone.","title":"Creating Two Executable Jars Using maven-assembly-plugin","body":"<p>When I was searching for different ways to create multiple <code>jar</code>'s from the same project, I came across several answers, and it turned out that other answers were marked as <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8726884/create-multiple-runnable-jars-with-dependencies-included-from-a-single-maven-p\">duplicates</a> of that particular answer. Additionally, a quick internet search also led me to a that question, which was not as comprehensive as it could be (in my opinion). I noticed that in many cases, people suggest using the <code>maven-assembly-plugin</code>, <code>maven-shade-plugin</code>, and sometimes the <code>onejar-maven-plugin</code> to create multiple <code>jar</code>s. However, there is one more way to achieve this by using the simple <code>maven-jar-plugin</code>, which I'll describe in detail below.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>All possible solutions</h1>\n<p>Here is a short description of the plugins that you can use to assemble your program into several <code>jar</code> archives (I obtained most of the information directly from the official sites):</p>\n<h2>maven-assembly-plugin</h2>\n<p>The Assembly Plugin for Maven enables developers to combine project output into a single distributable archive that also contains dependencies, modules, site documentation, and other files. Currently it can create distributions in the following formats: <code>zip</code>, <code>tar</code>, <code>tar.gz</code>, <code>tar.bz2</code>, <code>tar.snappy</code>, <code>tar.xz</code>, <code>tar.zst</code>, <code>jar</code>, <code>dir</code>, <code>war</code>. If your project wants to package your artifact in an <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11947037/what-is-an-uber-jar\">uber-jar</a>, the assembly plugin provides only basic support. For more control, use the <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maven Shade Plugin</a>.

Any ideas?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","abstract-class"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":28367824,"reputation":73,"user_id":21696871,"display_name":"fnymmm"},"score":1,"creation_date":1685962458,"post_id":76405704,"comment_id":134729205,"body_markdown":"Does this answer your question?

Or you can also solve this by registering a custom `TypeAdapter` for `File`:\r\n```java\r\nclass FileTypeAdapter extends TypeAdapter&lt;File&gt; {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void write(JsonWriter out, File file) throws IOException {\r\n        if (file == null) {\r\n            out.nullValue();\r\n        } else {\r\n            out.value(file.getPath());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public File read(JsonReader in) throws IOException {\r\n        if (in.peek() == JsonToken.NULL) {\r\n            in.nextNull();\r\n            return null;\r\n        } else {\r\n            return new File(in.nextString());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n(Coincidentally this custom `TypeAdapter` also produces more compact JSON because it serializes the `File` as a JSON string value whereas the reflection-based adapter would serialize it as JSON object with JSON string property.)\r\n\r\nYou can then register the adapter like this:\r\n```java\r\nGson gson = new GsonBuilder()\r\n    .registerTypeAdapter(File.class, new FileTypeAdapter())\r\n    .create();\r\n```\r\nIf that does not solve your issue, you could also try registering the adapter with `GsonBuilder.registerTypeHierarchyAdapter`.
