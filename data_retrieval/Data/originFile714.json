The latter has been set up with a controller class that handles the initial request for a particular document through a related REST controller. This controller class is extended by specific classes for each document, which assemble the end product; inheritance was not my idea.\r\n\r\nTo measure performance I want to log execution time for individual methods by using an `@Around` advice. However, even when the functions are individually annotated, those in the subclass are not advised. Methods further in the call stack that are not inherited from the initial controller class are not ignored. The relevant subclass methods are public and they are not inherited from the superclass. \r\n\r\nLogging the execution time of the controller method is meant to provide the overall duration. Information with respect to subsequent functions is supposed to indicate possible bottlenecks. How can I include the methods declared in the subclass? \r\n\r\nConfidentiality precludes sharing specifics, but the relevant aspects of the class structure can be conveyed using generic names:\r\n\r\n[![document generator abbreviated class model][1]][1] [  \r\n\r\nTo follow best practices I always intended to implement custom annotations to be used in pointcuts. Nevertheless, initially, I used signature based pointcuts and their combinations. Ignoring package elements of the pointcut declaration: \r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Pointcut(&quot;execution(public String Controller.*(..)&quot;)\r\npublic void controllerPointcut() {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach captures the controller methods, as do similar declarations for the reader classes. However such pointcuts are simply ignored in the case of the subclass. Using the + symbol to target child classes does not help.

The latter has been set up with a controller class that handles the initial request for a particular document through a related REST controller. This controller class is extended by specific classes for each document, which assemble the end product; inheritance was not my idea.</p>\n<p>To measure performance I want to log execution time for individual methods by using an <code>@Around</code> advice. However, even when the functions are individually annotated, those in the subclass are not advised. Methods further in the call stack that are not inherited from the initial controller class are not ignored. The relevant subclass methods are public and they are not inherited from the superclass.</p>\n<p>Logging the execution time of the controller method is meant to provide the overall duration. Information with respect to subsequent functions is supposed to indicate possible bottlenecks. How can I include the methods declared in the subclass?</p>\n<p>Confidentiality precludes sharing specifics, but the relevant aspects of the class structure can be conveyed using generic names:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yrCxv.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yrCxv.png\" alt=\"document generator abbreviated class model\" /></a> [</p>\n<p>To follow best practices I always intended to implement custom annotations to be used in pointcuts. Nevertheless, initially, I used signature based pointcuts and their combinations. Ignoring package elements of the pointcut declaration:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Pointcut(&quot;execution(public String Controller.*(..)&quot;)\npublic void controllerPointcut() {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This approach captures the controller methods, as do similar declarations for the reader classes. However such pointcuts are simply ignored in the case of the subclass. Using the + symbol to target child classes does not help. The documentation indicates that inherited or declared methods in a subclass can be targeted by signature. In the specific case this results in an <code>IllegalStateException</code> due to ambiguous mapping, as does the use of a class level annotation, unsurprisingly.</p>\n<p>I only need to log two methods in the child classes, so I hoped to target them directly with a common annotation, which I also added to the controller and reader methods.

Transient properties are ignored in Spring Data modules (not only Spring Data Elasticsearch).\r\n\r\nBut you you can use the `org.springframework.data.annotation.ReadOnlyProperty` annotation for this:\r\n\r\n    @Id\r\n    @ReadOnlyProperty\r\n    private String id;\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn&#39;t know up to now that this exists, this comes from Spring Data Commons as well and is checked in the `isWriteable()` method of the property when properties are written by the `MappingElasticsearchConverter` .\r\n\r\n**Question 2:**\r\n\r\nSurely not incorrect, but problematic as you found out. We always consider the whole entity when storing it, so we never thought about not writing the id.

In Java, the only two valid values are `true` and `false`. Therefore, you cannot assign integer values to a boolean variable. \r\n\r\nFor your boolean expressions to be valid, your variables `skyB` and `day` must be `boolean` data types\r\n\r\n```\r\nboolean skyB = false\r\nboolean day = true\r\n\r\nif (!skyB || day) {\r\n  System.out.print(&quot;example text&quot;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `boolean` fields are evaluated without the need to compare them to true or false. The expression `!skyB` (read &quot;not skyB&quot;) evaluates to `false`. So this is the equivalent to `skyB == false`. Since that portion evaluates to true (skyB is equal to false), the second part of the expression is skipped and the `System.out.print()` is called. If the value of `skyB` was changed to true, the variable `day` would then be evaluated and the if-statement would be executed if the value of that variable equals true (which it is).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could build boolean expressions using numeric values. How? Simple. Any mathematical expression is evaluated the same. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nint x = 5;\r\nint y = 3;\r\n\r\nif (x &gt; y) {\r\n  System.out.println(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBasically... The logic of what you are trying to do (the way I understood it) is correct, but your implementation was not. You cannnot mix boolean fields and numeric values. It is simply not allowed in Java.\r\n\r\nNow, to your question...\r\n\r\n```\r\nboolean skyB = false; // this must be boolean, not int\r\nint day =2;       // this is fine\r\n\r\nif (skyB || day == 1) {\r\n  System.out.print(&quot;example text&quot;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nShould produce the desired outcome. In plain English, the above is read:\r\n\r\n&gt; If skyB is false OR is day one, print &quot;example test&quot;\r\n\r\nIf either part of the expression fails to evaluate to true (i.e. if skyB is true and day variable is any value other than one), it will not print anything.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**:\r\n\r\nEven if this answer has been accepted and upvoted, I would like to include some information about boolean expressions for the benefit of new developers that might be struggling with this concept.\r\n\r\n&gt; What is a Boolean Expression?\r\n\r\nAccording to [Oracle documentation][1], &quot;*A Boolean expression is a logical statement that is either TRUE or FALSE.*&quot; These expressions take a few different forms. For example,\r\n\r\n- ***Boolean literals***\r\n```\r\nif (true) {...}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no real reason for such if-statement, the above is a valid expression. &quot;If true, do the stuff inside the curly braces.&quot; This means that the stuff inside will always execute (making it the same as not having the &quot;if&quot;. However, this is the basis for understanding the rest.\r\n\r\n- ***Boolean variables***\r\n```\r\nboolean isBlue = false;\r\nif (isBlue) {...}\r\n```\r\nIn the above case, the Boolean expression is the variable itself. The expectation is that, if the variable value evaluates to `true`, the stuff inside the curly braces will be executed. Since the value is false, it won&#39;t be executed. The above &quot;if&quot; is the more accepted short form of\r\n```\r\nboolean isBlue = false;\r\nif (isBlue == true) {...}\r\n```\r\nSo, since the left hand (variable) value of this evaluation is false and the right side is true, the complete expression evaluates to false. Therefore, the stuff inside curly braces won&#39;t be executed (false does not equals true). However\r\n```\r\nboolean isBlue = false;\r\nif(!isBlue == true){...}\r\n```\r\nNegating a boolean variable toggles it&#39;s value. In this case, the `isBlue` variable holds the value of `false`. The &quot;not&quot; operator toggles its value to `true`. Since `true == true` evaluates to true (true equals true is a true expression), the stuff inside curly braces is executed.\r\n\r\n- ***Functions that yield a boolean value***\r\n```\r\npublic boolean isSkyBlue() {\r\n  return true; // sorry for the over simplification\r\n}\r\n...\r\nif (isSkyBlue()) {...}\r\n```\r\nThis is nothing more than an advance form of what I have shown already. In this case, the method &quot;computes&quot; the boolean value to be returned. Since boolean values are expressions onto themselves, it is valid to insert a method call such as the one illustrated above inside the parentheses. The stuff inside curly braces will execute so long the function returns `true`.\r\n\r\n- ***Comparison operations***\r\n\r\nI included the following example already:\r\n```\r\nint x = 5;\r\nint y = 3;\r\n\r\nif (x &gt; y) {\r\n  System.out.println(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAny type of comparison operation will yield true or false. Therefore, these comparison operations are boolean expressions. This also includes the result of overridden `Object#equals(Object)` method. For example:\r\n```\r\nString s = &quot;Hello&quot;;\r\nif (s.equals(&quot;Hello&quot;)) {...}\r\n```\r\nAs a side note, objects in Java should be compared using an overridden `equals()` method, and not using the double-equals operator (unless you are only interested in comparing the object references (address) to be equal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B12037_01/olap.101/b10339/expression006.htm","title":"Comparing an int initialization with a boolean operator for an if statement parameter","body":"<p>The simple answer: this isn't C++</p>\n<p>You cannot assign numeric value to boolean fields.

They actually *can*, but then `x` of `C` is said to *hide* `x` of `P`. This is defined in the Java Language Specification (JLS), [&#167; 8.3][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt; If a class declares a field with a certain name, then the declaration of that field is said to **hide any and all accessible declarations of fields with the same name in superclasses**, and superinterfaces of the class. \r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;(Emphasis mine.)&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\nThis has two implications:\r\n\r\n1. You can refer to `P.x` from within `C` by using `super` (JLS [&#167; 15.11.2][2]):\r\n\r\n    ```java\r\n    class C extends P {\r\n\r\n        int x;\r\n\r\n        void test() {\r\n            System.out.println(super.x);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2.

You might want to have a look [at these examples][2] provided by Apache Poi itself about this topic (the url may change slightly over time). [This article][3] also may provide an hint for the solution you&#39;re asking for.\r\n\r\nYou can create a new `Workbook` (the Java Object representing your excel) using [WorkbookFactory][4] as follows:\r\n\r\n    Workbook workbook = WorkbookFactory.create(new FileInputStream(excelFilePath));\r\n\r\nwhere `excelFilePath` is (obviously) the Path of the excel file you want to update.\r\n\r\nYou can now do whatever you want with your `Workbook`, hurray! You can both read and change all its content and (eventually) write new one! *Note that all the changes to your `Workbook` are NOT actually going to affect your excel file.* You&#39;re editing the `Workbook` Java Object, not the actual excel file. In a sense, your `Workbook` is initially created based on your excel file content, then it is totally independent from it.\r\n\r\nOnce you&#39;re done editing your `Workbook`, you can save it overriding your initial excel file (in a way, *you&#39;re now updating your excel file with all your changes*) as follows:\r\n\r\n    FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(excelFilePath);\r\n    workbook.write(outputStream);\r\n    workbook.close();\r\n    outputStream.close();\r\n\r\nand you&#39;re done!

This solution is as horrible as HSSF is (did you get the [joke][7]?).\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re using .xlsx excel files, you may want to use Apache Poi XSSF objects (as [XSSFWorkbook][8], [XSSFRow][9] and [XSSFCell][10]). More about [XSSF vs HSSF on this post][11].\r\n\r\nFinally, here it is the explicit list of all libreries needed in order for my code to run (they&#39;re a lot, do not panic): [Apache Poi 4.1.2][12], [Apache Poi Ooxml 4.1.2][13], [Apache Poi Ooxml Schemas 4.1.2][14], [XmlBeans][15], [Commons Codec][16], [Commons Collections4][17], [Commons Compress][18] and [Commons Math3][19].

Opening more and more Consumers without closing them\r\n\r\nA rebalance takes place if you add a consumer to an existing ConsumerGroup. Therefore, it is essential to close the consumer after usage or to always use the same instance instead of creating new KafkaConsumer object for every message/iteration.\r\n\r\n## 2.

As your consumer is taking more than those 5 minutes, the consumer is considered failed and the group will rebalance in order to reassign the partitions to another member (see [Consumer Configuration][1]).\r\n\r\n### Solution for Poll Timeout:\r\nA possible solution is also given in the error message\r\n&gt; You can address this either by increasing `max.poll.interval.ms` or by reducing the maximum size of batches returned in poll() with `max.poll.records`.\r\n\r\nThe consumer reads all messages again, because (as the error shows) it is not able to commit the offsets. That means, if you start the Consumer with the same `group.id` it think that it never read anything from that topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3. Timeout of Heartbeat\r\n\r\nThere are two main configuration in your KafkaConsumer that deal with the heartbeats: `heartbeat.interval.ms` and `session.timeout.ms`.\r\n\r\nIn a seperate background thread your KafkaConsumer sends periodic heartbeats to the server. If the consumer crashes or is unable to send heartbeats for a duration of session.timeout.ms, then the consumer will be considered dead and its partitions will be reassigned. If the rebalance is triggered your consumer can&#39;t commit anything from an &quot;old assigned&quot; partition as it is written in the description of the CommitFailedException: &quot;This can happen when a group rebalance completes before the commit could be successfully applied.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n### Solution for Heartbeat Timeout:\r\n\r\nIncrease the settings `heartbeat.interval.ms` and `session.timeout.ms` while following the recommendation: &quot; The `heartbeat.interval.ms` must be set lower than `session.timeout.ms`, but typically should be set no higher than 1/3 of that value.&quot;\r\n\r\nJust keep in mind that changing these values always comes with a trade-off.
