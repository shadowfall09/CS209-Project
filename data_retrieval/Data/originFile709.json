How does Tomcat parse the request information and send it to the servlets?\r\n\r\nThe [Servlet specification][1] explains that in detail. The spec is surprisingly easy to read; I suggest giving it a go. \r\n\r\nAs a simplified overview…\r\n\r\nThe job of a Servlet container is to process the incoming request, which is just a bunch of text. The Servlet container pulls out the various pieces and assembles them into a request object. \r\n\r\nLikewise, the response produced by your servlet is packaged up as a response object. The Servlet container&#39;s job is to use all the info contained in that object to create a stream of text to be sent back to the client web browser.\r\n\r\nThe whole point of Servlet containers is to relieve the servlet-writing programmers of the need to know much of the details of HTTP and how to make a server. The Servlet container does all that work. In other words, the great thing about Servlet technology is that you the programmer need not ask this # 2 question of yours!\r\n\r\n# 3. Is Tomcat a servlet container or a web server? Are these the same thing?\r\n\r\n(a) both, (b) no. \r\n\r\nNo, servlet containers and web servers are two different kinds of software. \r\n\r\nA web server handles:\r\n\r\n - listening for incoming connections from clients (web browsers, etc.)\r\n - sending response back to the client\r\n\r\nA web server handles all the network traffic. \r\n\r\nA Servlet container provides an environment in which relatively small chunks of code (servlets) can process a request and formulate a response. The small servlet does not have to handle network traffic, launching &amp; shutting down, security, and all the other responsibilities of a full server. That explains the &quot;-let&quot; in &quot;Servlet&quot;. \r\n\r\nYour servlet you write plugs into a Servlet container. The container communicates with the web server, receiving each request passed by the web server, and passing to the web server the response produced by your servlet. When a request arrives, the container invokes your servlet. \r\n\r\nYour servlet remains blissfully ignorant as to what particular Servlet container implementation is running, as long as it complies with the *Jakarta Servlet* specification. And your servlet remains blissfully ignorant as to the existence of web servers. \r\n\r\nSome products, such as Tomcat &amp; Jetty, can be composed of *both* a web server and a Servlet container. \r\n\r\nTomcat is composed mainly of three components: (1) Catalina, a servlet container, (2) Coyote, a web server, and (3) Jasper, a Jakarta Server Pages processor. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Tomcat).\r\n\r\nFor most people&#39;s needs, the *Coyote* web server in Tomcat is a suitable web server. So you can use Tomcat as as all-in-one application server, handling both web traffic and servlets.\r\n\r\n```none\r\n[web request] ➜ [Tomcat Coyote] ➜ [Tomcat Catalina] ➜ [your servlet]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, some folks choose to use Tomcat only as a Servlet container, sitting behind a separate web server such as [Apache HTTP Server][2]. In such a case, Tomcat’s *Coyote* component goes unused. Instead, the separate web server handles client browser components, and processes incoming requests. If a request is asking for a static resource, the web server serves it out, without any involvement from Tomcat. If the request is asking for work that has been assigned to a servlet, then the separate web server passes the request on to Tomcat and its *Catalina* component.

How does Tomcat parse the request information and send it to the servlets?</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Servlet specification</a> explains that in detail. The spec is surprisingly easy to read; I suggest giving it a go.</p>\n<p>As a simplified overview…</p>\n<p>The job of a Servlet container is to process the incoming request, which is just a bunch of text. The Servlet container pulls out the various pieces and assembles them into a request object.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the response produced by your servlet is packaged up as a response object. The Servlet container's job is to use all the info contained in that object to create a stream of text to be sent back to the client web browser.</p>\n<p>The whole point of Servlet containers is to relieve the servlet-writing programmers of the need to know much of the details of HTTP and how to make a server. The Servlet container does all that work. In other words, the great thing about Servlet technology is that you the programmer need not ask this # 2 question of yours!</p>\n<h1>3. Is Tomcat a servlet container or a web server? Are these the same thing?</h1>\n<p>(a) both, (b) no.</p>\n<p>No, servlet containers and web servers are two different kinds of software.</p>\n<p>A web server handles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>listening for incoming connections from clients (web browsers, etc.)</li>\n<li>sending response back to the client</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A web server handles all the network traffic.</p>\n<p>A Servlet container provides an environment in which relatively small chunks of code (servlets) can process a request and formulate a response. The small servlet does not have to handle network traffic, launching &amp; shutting down, security, and all the other responsibilities of a full server. That explains the &quot;-let&quot; in &quot;Servlet&quot;.</p>\n<p>Your servlet you write plugs into a Servlet container. The container communicates with the web server, receiving each request passed by the web server, and passing to the web server the response produced by your servlet. When a request arrives, the container invokes your servlet.</p>\n<p>Your servlet remains blissfully ignorant as to what particular Servlet container implementation is running, as long as it complies with the <em>Jakarta Servlet</em> specification. And your servlet remains blissfully ignorant as to the existence of web servers.</p>\n<p>Some products, such as Tomcat &amp; Jetty, can be composed of <em>both</em> a web server and a Servlet container.</p>\n<p>Tomcat is composed mainly of three components: (1) Catalina, a servlet container, (2) Coyote, a web server, and (3) Jasper, a Jakarta Server Pages processor. See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Tomcat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>.</p>\n<p>For most people's needs, the <em>Coyote</em> web server in Tomcat is a suitable web server. So you can use Tomcat as as all-in-one application server, handling both web traffic and servlets.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>[web request] ➜ [Tomcat Coyote] ➜ [Tomcat Catalina] ➜ [your servlet]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively, some folks choose to use Tomcat only as a Servlet container, sitting behind a separate web server such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apache HTTP Server</a>. In such a case, Tomcat’s <em>Coyote</em> component goes unused. Instead, the separate web server handles client browser components, and processes incoming requests. If a request is asking for a static resource, the web server serves it out, without any involvement from Tomcat. If the request is asking for work that has been assigned to a servlet, then the separate web server passes the request on to Tomcat and its <em>Catalina</em> component. After your servlet produces a response, the response moves from Tomcat back to the external web server, which traffics the response onwards to the client web browser.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>[web request] ➜ [Apache HTTP Server] ➜ [Tomcat Catalina] ➜ [your servlet]\n</code></pre>\n<h1>4 … embedded vs. non-embedded …</h1>\n<p>Non-embedded is the classic situation, as originally envisioned when Servlet technology was first invented.</p>\n<p>Back then, servers were few, expensive, and already in place permanently.

It will be everything or nothing.\r\n\r\n# Preventing files downloads when a direct link is used\r\n\r\nMore important, to prevent direct linking to your pictures, you can only do this BEFORE PHP is involved to display your website, so ONLY AT THE WEB SERVER level. You need to tell the webserver to forbid any image access not made directly by itself (to display the image of your website). \r\nTo do this you need to play with the webserver configuration file: ***.htaccess*** located at the root level of your standard WordPress installation.\r\n\r\n# Editing .htaccess\r\n\r\n 1. open ***/.htaccess*** \r\n 2. Add the following code before the `#BEGIN Wordpress` line and adapt it with your website domain name knowing that the following code is made for a website located at *www.example.com*. This sample of code is blocking direct downloads of every .txt, .mp4, .jpg and .png files. If you want to make another choice, just change *txt|mp4|jpg|png* in the code: \r\n\r\n        &lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;\r\n\r\n        RewriteEngine On\r\n        RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^https://(www\\.)?example\\.com [NC]\r\n        RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^https://(www\\.)?example\\.com.*$ [NC]\r\n        RewriteRule \\.(txt|mp4|jpg|png)$ - [F]\r\n        # or, much better, less radical, you can replace the last RewriteRule by the following one, to display always the same page or image from your website, changing *https://www.example.com/link-to-page-or-image* to the address of the page or image you&#39;d like to display when someone is trying to download a file using a direct link :\r\n        # RewriteRule \\.(txt|mp4|jpg|png)$ https://www.example.com/link-to-page-or-image [L]\r\n\r\n        &lt;/IfModule&gt;\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n 1. Empty your browser cache.\r\n 2. Try to reach an image of your website entering the direct link to that image in your browser address bar (in WP for example go to your *Media Library*, select any image - a .jpg one if you adapted the previous code to prevent direct downloading of .jpg images - and use the copy button to copy image URL then open a browser new window and paste the copied url in your browser address bar). You should see that the image can&#39;t be downloaded by this way. \r\n 3. Visit to your website : all the images are displayed and every functionalities involving images and direct links (lightbox...) should still be working perfectly because only the webserver has the right to call them.\r\n 4. If the results looks perfect to you, don&#39;t forget to save a copy of the edited ***.htaccess*** file on your desktop for example (removing the dot if your are working on Mac or Linux machine to keep it visible) since Wordpress, in some circumstances, could regenerate that file without the added code. My advice on this point: when you have changed any settings in WP and mainly the some related to permalinks (adding some extensions could also involved ***.htaccess*** edition), take a look at the ***.htaccess*** file&#39;s content to check if the added code is still there... Or add it again.\r\n\r\nEnjoy! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"How to prevent the right click &quot;Save as image&quot; or &quot;open image in New Tab&quot; on wordpress?","body":"<p>The second question - how to disable direct download of any file when you know its url - is a great one!

there are 2 roles: &quot;BUYER&quot; and &quot;SELLER&quot;. I have a table called <code>users</code> in a MySQL database that stores users along with their usernames, passwords and their roles. I would like to implement an authentication method that allows me to specify which endpoints can be called based on the role of the user (e.g. anyone can create a new user, buyers can purchase products from the vending machine and sellers can add new products). Most of the tutorials I have seen have been using an old version of Spring Boot Security and using things like the <code>WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter</code> which have since been deprecated and therefore I cannot follow the tutorials and other ones are using h2 or other in memory databases. How can I implement this authentication using MySQL.</p>\n<p>Worth noting I am using Postman to test my requests.</p>\n<p><code>users</code>

I have a project on magic squares and my code can solve 3x3 and 5x5 but not 44 and 6x6 arrays for some reason. To give some info about the project we make a program that should give the user 4 option to solve a magic square (using an arraylist as a stack or as queue, a stack and a linked list as a queue). The code makes copies of the magic square and each of them has a new cell filled with a number according to the check methods and its i,j position. Each copy is created checked and filled if possible in the nextSuccessor() method. if at least a number can fill the cell the copy is returned to the main program to be stored in the data structure the user has chosen in the beginning of the program. If no number could fill the cell the method returns null. The program ends when either all the cells of a copy of a magic square are filled, or if the data structure gets empty. \r\n\r\nps: That first constructor that is in the MagicSquare class is what we were instructed to do so that&#39;s why i made the set method. \r\n\r\nHere are the two classes:\r\n```\r\npublic class MagicSquare{\r\n    int N;\r\n    int C;\r\n    int[][] magic;

Still nothing... Everything i tried is as a comment in the classes&#39; code.\r\n\r\nSo Any ideas?","title":"Java Code solves 3x3 and 5x5 magic squares but not 4x4 and 6x6","body":"<p>Hey guys new to programming here. I have a project on magic squares and my code can solve 3x3 and 5x5 but not 44 and 6x6 arrays for some reason. To give some info about the project we make a program that should give the user 4 option to solve a magic square (using an arraylist as a stack or as queue, a stack and a linked list as a queue). The code makes copies of the magic square and each of them has a new cell filled with a number according to the check methods and its i,j position. Each copy is created checked and filled if possible in the nextSuccessor() method. if at least a number can fill the cell the copy is returned to the main program to be stored in the data structure the user has chosen in the beginning of the program. If no number could fill the cell the method returns null. The program ends when either all the cells of a copy of a magic square are filled, or if the data structure gets empty.</p>\n<p>ps: That first constructor that is in the MagicSquare class is what we were instructed to do so that's why i made the set method.</p>\n<p>Here are the two classes:</p>\n<pre><code>public class MagicSquare{\n    int N;\n    int C;\n    int[][] magic;

The length of the local variable array of a frame is determined at compile-time and supplied in the binary representation of a class or interface along with the code for the method associated with the frame (&#167;4.7.3).\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; A single local variable can hold a value of type boolean, byte, char, short, int, float, reference, or returnAddress. A pair of local variables can hold a value of type long or double.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Local variables are addressed by indexing. The index of the first local variable is zero. An integer is considered to be an index into the local variable array if and only if that integer is between zero and one less than the size of the local variable array.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; **A value of type long or type double occupies two consecutive local variables. Such a value may only be addressed using the lesser index. For example, a value of type double stored in the local variable array at index n actually occupies the local variables with indices n and n+1; however, the local variable at index n+1 cannot be loaded from. It can be stored into. However, doing so invalidates the contents of local variable n.**\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The Java Virtual Machine does not require n to be even. In intuitive terms, values of types long and double need not be 64-bit aligned in the local variables array. Implementors are free to decide the appropriate way to represent such values using the two local variables reserved for the value.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The Java Virtual Machine uses local variables to pass parameters on method invocation. On class method invocation, any parameters are passed in consecutive local variables starting from local variable 0. On instance method invocation, local variable 0 is always used to pass a reference to the object on which the instance method is being invoked (this in the Java programming language).

A pair of local variables can hold a value of type long or double.</p>\n<p>Local variables are addressed by indexing. The index of the first local variable is zero. An integer is considered to be an index into the local variable array if and only if that integer is between zero and one less than the size of the local variable array.</p>\n<p><strong>A value of type long or type double occupies two consecutive local variables. Such a value may only be addressed using the lesser index. For example, a value of type double stored in the local variable array at index n actually occupies the local variables with indices n and n+1; however, the local variable at index n+1 cannot be loaded from. It can be stored into. However, doing so invalidates the contents of local variable n.</strong></p>\n<p>The Java Virtual Machine does not require n to be even. In intuitive terms, values of types long and double need not be 64-bit aligned in the local variables array. Implementors are free to decide the appropriate way to represent such values using the two local variables reserved for the value.</p>\n<p>The Java Virtual Machine uses local variables to pass parameters on method invocation. On class method invocation, any parameters are passed in consecutive local variables starting from local variable 0. On instance method invocation, local variable 0 is always used to pass a reference to the object on which the instance method is being invoked (this in the Java programming language). Any parameters are subsequently passed in consecutive local variables starting from local variable 1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis mine)</p>\n<p>You store a double in slot 5 (which occupies the slots 5 and 6), then you store something in slot 6, thereby invalidating the variable in slot 5.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":13087646,"reputation":23,"user_id":9456163,"display_name":"Tambapps"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":246,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":75201088,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1674396594,"creation_date":1674389306,"question_id":75200278,"body_markdown":"I am trying to generate Java bytecode using the Java Asm library (I am basically trying to create yet another JVM programming language)\r\n\r\nHere is the code I am compiling\r\n```groovy\r\nfloat f = 2f\r\nfloat f2 = new Float(2f)\r\nFloat f3 = f2\r\nprintln(f2)\r\n\r\ndouble d = 2d\r\ndouble d2 = new Double(2d)\r\nDouble d3 = d2\r\nprintln(d2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see the syntax is very similar to Java. `println` is just a call to `System.out.println`. \r\n\r\nWhen I use my compiler, it generates the following code (got this output using javap)\r\n\r\n```text\r\nCode:\r\n       0: ldc           #14                 // float 2.0f\r\n       2: fstore_1\r\n       3: new           #16                 // class java/lang/Float\r\n       6: dup\r\n       7: ldc           #14                 // float 2.0f\r\n       9: invokespecial #19                 // Method java/lang/Float.&quot;&lt;init&gt;&quot;:(F)V\r\n      12: invokevirtual #23                 // Method java/lang/Float.floatValue:()F\r\n      15: fstore_2\r\n      16: fload_2\r\n      17: invokestatic  #27                 // Method java/lang/Float.valueOf:(F)Ljava/lang/Float;\r\n      20: astore_3\r\n      21: getstatic     #33                 // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;\r\n      24: fload_2\r\n      25: invokevirtual #38                 // Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(F)V\r\n      28: ldc2_w        #39                 // double 2.0d\r\n      31: dstore        4\r\n      33: new           #42                 // class java/lang/Double\r\n      36: dup\r\n      37: ldc2_w        #39                 // double 2.0d\r\n      40: invokespecial #45                 // Method java/lang/Double.&quot;&lt;init&gt;&quot;:(D)V\r\n      43: invokevirtual #49                 // Method java/lang/Double.doubleValue:()D\r\n      46: dstore        5\r\n      48: dload         5\r\n      50: invokestatic  #52                 // Method java/lang/Double.valueOf:(D)Ljava/lang/Double;\r\n      53: astore        6\r\n      55: getstatic     #33                 // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;\r\n      58: dload         5\r\n      60: invokevirtual #54                 // Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(D)V\r\n      63: aconst_null\r\n      64: areturn\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when I execute this code I get the following error\r\n\r\n```text\r\nException in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.VerifyError: Bad local variable type\r\nException Details:\r\n  Location:\r\n    Test.run()Ljava/lang/Object; @58: dload\r\n  Reason:\r\n    Type top (current frame, locals[5]) is not assignable to double\r\n  Current Frame:\r\n    bci: @58\r\n    flags: { }\r\n    locals: { &#39;Test&#39;, float, float, &#39;java/lang/Float&#39;, top, top, &#39;java/lang/Double&#39; }\r\n    stack: { &#39;java/io/PrintStream&#39; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve used the `COMPUTE_MAXS` and `COMPUTE_FRAMES` when instantiating my ClassWriter\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been looking at this bytecode several times (and even asked ChatGPT lol) but couldn&#39;t find what is wrong. \r\nFrom what I see, I&#39;ve stored a primitive double in variable 5, and then I want to load it to invoke println(double).

The code is solid and a pleasure to read.  However, the documentation is very terse, with very few examples. Also the api is confusing because there seems to be 10 ways to do anything, and no indication of why you’d do it one way or another.\r\n\r\nThere are two alternatives: [Dozer][5] is the most popular, and [Orika][6] gets good reviews for ease of use.\r\n\r\nAssuming you still want to use mm, here’s what I’ve learned about it.\r\n\r\nThe main class, `ModelMapper`, should be a singleton in your app. For me, that meant a @Bean using Spring.  It works out of the box for simple cases. For example, suppose you have two classes:\r\n\r\n    class DogData\r\n    {\r\n        private String name;\r\n        private int mass;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    class DogInfo\r\n    {\r\n        private String name;\r\n        private boolean large;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nwith appropriate getters/setters.   You can do this:\r\n\r\n        ModelMapper mm = new ModelMapper();\r\n        DogData dd = new DogData();\r\n        dd.setName(&quot;fido&quot;);\r\n        dd.setMass(70);\r\n        DogInfo di = mm.map(dd, DogInfo.class);\r\n\r\nand the &quot;name&quot; will be copied from dd to di.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to customize mm, but first you need to understand how it works.\r\n\r\nThe mm object contains a TypeMap for each ordered pair of types, such as &amp;lt;DogInfo, DogData&gt; and &amp;lt;DogData, DogInfo&gt; would be two TypeMaps.\r\n\r\nEach **TypeMap** contains a **PropertyMap** with a list of mappings.  So in the example the mm will automatically create a TypeMap&amp;lt;DogData, DogInfo&gt; that contains a PropertyMap that has a single mapping.\r\n\r\nWe can write this \r\n\r\n        TypeMap&lt;DogData, DogInfo&gt; tm = mm.getTypeMap(DogData.class, DogInfo.class);\r\n        List&lt;Mapping&gt; list = tm.getMappings();\r\n        for (Mapping m : list)\r\n        {\r\n            System.out.println(m);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nand it will output\r\n\r\n    PropertyMapping[DogData.name -&gt; DogInfo.name]\r\n\r\nWhen you call **mm.map()** this is what it does,\r\n\r\n 1. see if the **TypeMap** exists yet, if not create the TypeMap for the &amp;lt;S,\r\n    D&gt; source/destination types\r\n 1. call the TypeMap **Condition**, if it returns FALSE, do nothing and STOP\r\n 1. call the TypeMap **Provider** to construct a new destination object if necessary\r\n 1. call the TypeMap **PreConverter** if it has one\r\n 1. do one of the following:\r\n     - if the TypeMap has a **custom Converter**, call it\r\n     - or, generate a **PropertyMap** (based on **Configuration flags** plus any **custom mappings** that were added), and use it\r\n(Note: the TypeMap also has optional custom Pre/PostPropertyConverters that *I think* will run at this point before and after *each mapping*.)\r\n 1. call the TypeMap **PostConverter** if it has one\r\n\r\nCaveat: This flowchart is [sort of documented][7] but I had to guess a lot, so it might not be all correct!\r\n\r\nYou can customize *every single step* of this process. But the two most common are\r\n\r\n-    step 5a. – write custom TypeMap Converter, or\r\n-    step 5b. – write custom Property Mapping.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample of a **custom TypeMap Converter**:\r\n\r\n        Converter&lt;DogData, DogInfo&gt; myConverter = new Converter&lt;DogData, DogInfo&gt;()\r\n        {\r\n            public DogInfo convert(MappingContext&lt;DogData, DogInfo&gt; context)\r\n            {\r\n                DogData s = context.getSource();\r\n                DogInfo d = context.getDestination();\r\n                d.setName(s.getName());\r\n                d.setLarge(s.getMass() &gt; 25);\r\n                return d;\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        mm.addConverter(myConverter);\r\n\r\n**Note** the converter is *one-way*. You have to write another if you want to customize DogInfo to DogData.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample of a **custom PropertyMap**:\r\n\r\n        Converter&lt;Integer, Boolean&gt; convertMassToLarge = new Converter&lt;Integer, Boolean&gt;()\r\n        {\r\n            public Boolean convert(MappingContext&lt;Integer, Boolean&gt; context)\r\n            {\r\n                // If the dog weighs more than 25, then it must be large\r\n                return context.getSource() &gt; 25;\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        PropertyMap&lt;DogData, DogInfo&gt; mymap = new PropertyMap&lt;DogData, DogInfo&gt;()\r\n        {\r\n            protected void configure()\r\n            {\r\n                // Note: this is not normal code. It is &quot;EDSL&quot; so don&#39;t get confused\r\n                map(source.getName()).setName(null);\r\n                using(convertMassToLarge).map(source.getMass()).setLarge(false);\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        mm.addMappings(mymap);\r\n\r\nThe pm.configure function is really funky. It’s not actual code. It is dummy [EDSL code][8] that gets interpreted somehow. For instance the parameter to the setter is not relevant, it is just a placeholder.  You can do lots of stuff in here, such as\r\n\r\n-\twhen(condition).map(getter).setter\r\n-\twhen(condition).skip().setter                – safely ignore field.\r\n-\tusing(converter).map(getter).setter          – custom field converter\r\n-\twith(provider).map(getter).setter           – custom field constructor\r\n\r\n**Note** the custom mappings are *added* to the default mappings, so you do *not* need, for example, to specify\r\n\r\n                map(source.getName()).setName(null);\r\n\r\nin your custom PropertyMap.configure().\r\n\r\nIn this example, I had to write a **Converter** to map Integer to Boolean. In most cases this will not be necessary because mm will automatically convert Integer to String, etc.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m told you can also create mappings [using Java 8 lambda][9] expressions. I tried, but I could not figure it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Final Recommendations and Best Practice**\r\n\r\nBy default mm uses `MatchingStrategies.STANDARD` which is dangerous. It can easily choose the wrong mapping and cause strange, hard to find bugs. And what if next year someone else adds a new column to the database? So don&#39;t do it. Make sure you use STRICT mode:\r\n\r\n        mm.getConfiguration().setMatchingStrategy(MatchingStrategies.STRICT);\r\n\r\nAlways write unit tests and ensure that all mappings are validated.\r\n\r\n        DogInfo di = mm.map(dd, DogInfo.class);\r\n        mm.validate();   // make sure nothing in the destination is accidentally skipped\r\n\r\nFix any validation failures with `mm.addMappings()` as shown above.  \r\n\r\nPut all your mappings in a central place, where the mm singleton is created.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://modelmapper.org/getting-started/\r\n  [2]: http://modelmapper.org/javadoc\r\n  [3]: http://www.talangsoft.org/2015/04/20/domain_mapping_with_modelmapper/\r\n  [4]: http://www.programcreek.com/java-api-examples/index.php?api=org.modelmapper.ModelMapper\r\n  [5]: http://dozer.sourceforge.net/documentation/usage.html\r\n  [6]: https://orika-mapper.github.io/orika-docs/\r\n  [7]: http://modelmapper.org/user-manual/how-it-works/\r\n  [8]: http://modelmapper.org/javadoc/org/modelmapper/PropertyMap.html\r\n  [9]: http://modelmapper.org/user-manual/property-mapping/","title":"How to customize ModelMapper","body":"<p>First here are some links</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://modelmapper.org/getting-started/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">modelmapper getting started</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://modelmapper.org/javadoc\" rel=\"noreferrer\">api doc</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.talangsoft.org/2015/04/20/domain_mapping_with_modelmapper/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">blog post</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.programcreek.com/java-api-examples/index.php?api=org.modelmapper.ModelMapper\" rel=\"noreferrer\">random code examples</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My impression of mm is that it is very well engineered.

So in the example the mm will automatically create a TypeMap&lt;DogData, DogInfo> that contains a PropertyMap that has a single mapping.</p>\n\n<p>We can write this </p>\n\n<pre><code>    TypeMap&lt;DogData, DogInfo&gt; tm = mm.getTypeMap(DogData.class, DogInfo.class);\n    List&lt;Mapping&gt; list = tm.getMappings();\n    for (Mapping m : list)\n    {\n        System.out.println(m);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and it will output</p>\n\n<pre><code>PropertyMapping[DogData.name -&gt; DogInfo.name]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When you call <strong>mm.map()</strong> this is what it does,</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>see if the <strong>TypeMap</strong> exists yet, if not create the TypeMap for the &lt;S,\nD> source/destination types</li>\n<li>call the TypeMap <strong>Condition</strong>, if it returns FALSE, do nothing and STOP</li>\n<li>call the TypeMap <strong>Provider</strong> to construct a new destination object if necessary</li>\n<li>call the TypeMap <strong>PreConverter</strong> if it has one</li>\n<li>do one of the following:\n\n<ul>\n<li>if the TypeMap has a <strong>custom Converter</strong>, call it</li>\n<li>or, generate a <strong>PropertyMap</strong> (based on <strong>Configuration flags</strong> plus any <strong>custom mappings</strong> that were added), and use it\n(Note: the TypeMap also has optional custom Pre/PostPropertyConverters that <em>I think</em> will run at this point before and after <em>each mapping</em>.)</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>call the TypeMap <strong>PostConverter</strong> if it has one</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Caveat: This flowchart is <a href=\"http://modelmapper.org/user-manual/how-it-works/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sort of documented</a> but I had to guess a lot, so it might not be all correct!</p>\n\n<p>You can customize <em>every single step</em> of this process. But the two most common are</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>step 5a. – write custom TypeMap Converter, or</li>\n<li>step 5b. – write custom Property Mapping.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here is a sample of a <strong>custom TypeMap Converter</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Converter&lt;DogData, DogInfo&gt; myConverter = new Converter&lt;DogData, DogInfo&gt;()\n    {\n        public DogInfo convert(MappingContext&lt;DogData, DogInfo&gt; context)\n        {\n            DogData s = context.getSource();\n            DogInfo d = context.getDestination();\n            d.setName(s.getName());\n            d.setLarge(s.getMass() &gt; 25);\n            return d;\n        }\n    };\n\n    mm.addConverter(myConverter);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong> the converter is <em>one-way</em>. You have to write another if you want to customize DogInfo to DogData.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a sample of a <strong>custom PropertyMap</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    Converter&lt;Integer, Boolean&gt; convertMassToLarge = new Converter&lt;Integer, Boolean&gt;()\n    {\n        public Boolean convert(MappingContext&lt;Integer, Boolean&gt; context)\n        {\n            // If the dog weighs more than 25, then it must be large\n            return context.getSource() &gt; 25;\n        }\n    };\n\n    PropertyMap&lt;DogData, DogInfo&gt; mymap = new PropertyMap&lt;DogData, DogInfo&gt;()\n    {\n        protected void configure()\n        {\n            // Note: this is not normal code. It is \"EDSL\" so don't get confused\n            map(source.getName()).setName(null);\n            using(convertMassToLarge).map(source.getMass()).setLarge(false);\n        }\n    };\n\n    mm.addMappings(mymap);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The pm.configure function is really funky. It’s not actual code. It is dummy <a href=\"http://modelmapper.org/javadoc/org/modelmapper/PropertyMap.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">EDSL code</a> that gets interpreted somehow. For instance the parameter to the setter is not relevant, it is just a placeholder.  You can do lots of stuff in here, such as</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>when(condition).map(getter).setter</li>\n<li>when(condition).skip().setter                – safely ignore field.</li>\n<li>using(converter).map(getter).setter          – custom field converter</li>\n<li>with(provider).map(getter).setter           – custom field constructor</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong> the custom mappings are <em>added</em> to the default mappings, so you do <em>not</em> need, for example, to specify</p>\n\n<pre><code>            map(source.getName()).setName(null);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>in your custom PropertyMap.configure().</p>\n\n<p>In this example, I had to write a <strong>Converter</strong> to map Integer to Boolean. In most cases this will not be necessary because mm will automatically convert Integer to String, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I'm told you can also create mappings <a href=\"http://modelmapper.org/user-manual/property-mapping/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">using Java 8 lambda</a> expressions. I tried, but I could not figure it out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final Recommendations and Best Practice</strong></p>\n\n<p>By default mm uses <code>MatchingStrategies.STANDARD</code> which is dangerous. It can easily choose the wrong mapping and cause strange, hard to find bugs. And what if next year someone else adds a new column to the database? So don't do it. Make sure you use STRICT mode:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    mm.getConfiguration().setMatchingStrategy(MatchingStrategies.STRICT);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Always write unit tests and ensure that all mappings are validated.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    DogInfo di = mm.map(dd, DogInfo.class);\n    mm.validate();   // make sure nothing in the destination is accidentally skipped\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Fix any validation failures with <code>mm.addMappings()</code> as shown above.  </p>\n\n<p>Put all your mappings in a central place, where the mm singleton is created.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":6087813,"reputation":15135,"user_id":4751165,"accept_rate":96,"display_name":"Pau"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1533596605,"creation_date":1497435696,"answer_id":44541983,"question_id":44534172,"body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been using it from last 6 months, I&#39;m going to explain some of my thoughts about that:\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is recommended to use it as an unique instance (singleton, spring bean,...), that&#39;s explained in the manual, and I think all agree with that.\r\n\r\n`ModelMapper` is a great mapping library and wide flexible.

Refer to [Scanner is skipping nextLine() after using next() or nextFoo()?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13102045/scanner-is-skipping-nextline-after-using-next-or-nextfoo). I suggest `nextLine()` together with `Integer.parseInt()`. Also, in my opinion, better to call method `nextLine()` rather than method `next()`.\r\n\r\nNow to your specific questions.\r\n\r\nVariable `phone1` should have type `long` and not type `int` since `int` cannot store the largest, possible, ten digit number. However phone numbers can have leading zeros. Since the data type of column `phone` in database table `UserDetails` is `BIGINT`, then, according to MySQL [documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-reference-type-conversions.html), that database data type maps to [Java] `long`. Therefore phone number cannot have leading zeros so checking the value entered by the user is done using a simple `if`:\r\n```java\r\nif (phone1 &lt; 1000000000L  ||  phone1 &gt; 9999999999L)\r\n```\r\nIn order to check date-of-birth (DOB), I suggest using [LocalDate](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/index.html). Note that `java.sql.Date` contains both a date and a time and a time-zone. However, I assume that DOB is just a date without a time and hence the time-zone is not relevant. Therefore, you can convert `java.sql.Date` to `LocalDate` and call appropriate methods to determine if the entered date is within the valid range.\r\n```java\r\nSystem.out.print(&quot;Enter DOB in YYYY-MM-DD format: &quot;);\r\nString dateOfBirth = sc.nextLine();\r\nDate date1 = Date.valueOf(dateOfBirth);\r\nLocalDate ld = date1.toLocalDate();\r\nif (ld.isBefore(LocalDate.of(1940, 1, 1)) || ld.isAfter(LocalDate.of(2000, 1, 1))) {\r\n    // Invalid DOB\r\n}\r\n```\r\nRefer to [Convert between LocalDate and sql.Date](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29750861/convert-between-localdate-and-sql-date)\r\n\r\nHere is my rewrite of your code.

That means code from outside the library&#39;s module cannot access the resource, because the library does not declare the necessary `opens` directives. Though this should only take effect if _BootstrapFX_ is being loaded as a named module (i.e., on the module-path). Otherwise, I would expect this to work:\r\n\r\n```lang-xml\r\n&lt;VBox stylehsheets=&quot;org/kordamp/bootstrapfx/bootstrapfx.css&quot;/&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;**Note:** In FXML, the `@` prefix is the [&quot;location resolution operator&quot;][4]. It means to treat the subsequent path as being relative _to the current FXML file_.

The project is using RxJava to handle the Login process in the app (which is causing another issue in of itself). So I wanted to check the Home Activity and see if the app is still good to go.

The project is using RxJava to handle the Login process in the app (which is causing another issue in of itself). So I wanted to check the Home Activity and see if the app is still good to go. But I just can't get passed this error. Any ideas or help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you</p>\n<p>P.S.
