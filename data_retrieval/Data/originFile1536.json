To create an array of any type, you need to first instantiate it correctly. To do this, you need to set its size. The reason why you need to set its size is because arrays are allocated in memory in contiguous locations. This means that each index location is right next to another.\r\n\r\n```\r\nString [] newArray = new String[SOME_SIZE];\r\n```\r\nThe `SOME_SIZE` is a value based on whatever you need. In your case, you have another array, `candidatesReport`, that could be used to determine the size (length) of your given array.\r\n```\r\nString [] newArray = new String[candiatesReport.length];\r\n```\r\nNow that is done, you need to set the value in the array.\r\n```\r\nnewArray[i] = ...;\r\n```\r\nFor you, this is done inside the loop...\r\n```\r\nfor(int i = 0; i &lt; candidatesReports.length; i++) {\r\n    newArray[i] = candidatesReports[i].getCandidateId() + &quot;:&quot; + this.calculateGrade(candidatesReports[i]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**:\r\nThis problem is mainly to display some information contained in an array of `CandidateReport` objects by collecting data from each instance and concatenating it as a `String`. Not knowing about the internals of the aforementioned class, I believe this problem is better served by overwriting the Object&#39;s class `toString()` method in the `CandidateReport` class, so when objects of this type are printed, the output comes the way we want it.

For example:\r\n```\r\nreturn candidateId + &quot;:&quot; + CalculatorUtilities.calculateGrade(grade);\r\n```\r\nThe point of the matter is that each class should override the `Object#toString()` method to provide a default string representation of objects of a given type. If you do this, you won&#39;t need the String array at all. But, if you still feel it is necessary to capture this data in an String array, your code will be much simpler because of the overridden `toString()` method.\r\n```\r\nfor(int i = 0; i &lt; candidatesReports.length; i++) {\r\n    newArray[i] = candidatesReports[i].toString();\r\n}\r\n```","title":"How to add a string into a StringArray","body":"<pre><code>String [] newArray = ;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is obviously wrong.

How can I inform Wildfly that the org.graalvm classes are available?\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\n\r\nThanks to ehsavoie for the hint! I already had such an idea but did something wrong when testing.\r\n\r\nYou do have to do the following:\r\n\r\n 1. Put in your file `jboss-dependendt-structure.xml` something like:\r\n\r\n        &lt;jboss-deployment-structure&gt;\r\n            &lt;deployment&gt;\r\n                &lt;dependencies&gt;\r\n                    &lt;module name=&quot;org.graalvm&quot; export=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;/dependencies&gt;\r\n            &lt;/deployment&gt;\r\n        &lt;/jboss-deployment-structure&gt;\r\n\r\n 2. define a file within `modules/org/graalvm/main/module.xml&#39; with content like:\r\n\r\n        &lt;module name=&quot;org.graalvm&quot; xmlns=&quot;urn:jboss:module:1.6&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;properties&gt;\r\n                &lt;property name=&quot;jboss.api&quot; value=&quot;public&quot;/&gt;\r\n            &lt;/properties&gt;\r\n            &lt;dependencies&gt;\r\n                &lt;system export=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;paths&gt;\r\n                        &lt;path name=&quot;org/graalvm/polyglot&quot;/&gt;\r\n                        &lt;!-- probably more packages will follow, but this is enough for the example --&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/paths&gt;\r\n                &lt;/system&gt;\r\n            &lt;/dependencies&gt;\r\n        &lt;/module&gt;\r\n\r\nSorry if there are any typos in upper examples. I hope, future Wildfly versions will maybe contain such a file automatically. For the moment, I am happy that it&#39;s working at all.","title":"Using GraalVM (scripting) within Wildfly/JBoss","body":"<p>I want to use GraalVM (version 22.0.0.2 with Java 17.0.2) to execute JavaScripts within Wildfly (version 26.0).</p>\n<p>If I do have the following code:</p>\n<pre><code>System.out.println(&quot;Polyglot class: &quot;+PolyglotException.class);\n</code></pre>\n<p>then my JSE unit test, started from Eclise, works fine.

I have downloaded different version of Eclipse IDE ( Eclipse 2021 , Eclipse 2022 , Eclipse 2019 and Even Spring tool suit 4).\nI am creating a simple gradle project and expecting to build it successfully with gradle. I have tried changing different versions of Gradle while crating the project in eclipse. Even Gradle wrapper is also not working. Gradle plugin always shows disabled in Help-&gt; About Eclipse IDE.\nHave removed Eclipse Gradle Build Ship plugin from market place and installed it again. Tried updating the Gradle build ship plugin. Have restarted eclipse several time after every try.</p>\n<p>Another strange behavior that i have observed is, If i change the gradle version while creating the project it always creates two projects/modules. one is with the name of the project that I have provided another one with the name &quot;lib&quot;.\nI am not sure what wrong i am doing and what configuration i should do to fix this issue and make the gradle builds successfully.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/v4rtI.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gradle plugin disabled in Eclipse</a></p>\n<p><a
