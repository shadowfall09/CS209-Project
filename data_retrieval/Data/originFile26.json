Now that I wrote this long question and re-read it, the answer might be an obvious &quot;yes&quot;.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","mockito"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":10043484,"reputation":247,"user_id":7425649,"display_name":"AbhiK"},"score":1,"creation_date":1626348019,"post_id":68113065,"comment_id":120871742,"body_markdown":"I was facing similar issue with java 16, I switch to java 8, that resolved my issue.

So, if you then call <code>new</code> on the controller, you will get <em>another</em> instance of the controller, totally unrelated to the instance created by the <code>FXMLLoader</code> and to the object hierarchy that was returned by the <a href=\"https://openjfx.io/javadoc/21/javafx.fxml/javafx/fxml/FXMLLoader.html#load()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>load()</code></a> method used.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternate approaches</strong></p>\n<p>Often when people create new controllers, what they should be doing instead is either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjfx.io/javadoc/21/javafx.fxml/javafx/fxml/FXMLLoader.html#getController()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Getting the controller</a> from the loader and using that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>OR</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring their code so that they don't need a controller reference at the place they are trying to use it (e.g. by <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32342864/applying-mvc-with-javafx\">applying an MVC design</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>OR</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting the controller instance on the FXMLLoader, then asking the loader to <code>load()</code> an FXML (that does not have an <code>fx:controller</code> attribute).  That will initialize the controller instance that was created in the code.</li>\n</ul>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":27281373,"reputation":1,"user_id":20801226,"display_name":"Mentos"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":85,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1701375825,"creation_date":1700826463,"question_id":77542904,"body_markdown":"so

I can implement a CachableRepository which will cache things or delegate to the non-cacheable repository in case of a miss.\r\n\r\n    public class CachableThingRepository implements ThingInterface{\r\n    \r\n        private ThingRepository thingRepository;\r\n        private Cache cache;\r\n    \r\n        public CachableThingRepository(ThingRepository thingRepository, Cache cache) {\r\n            this.thingRepository = thingRepository;\r\n            this.cache = cache;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public Map&lt;Long, String&gt; findById(long id) {\r\n            if(cache.has(&quot;some_key&quot;)) {\r\n                return cache.get(&quot;some_key&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n            Map&lt;Long, String&gt; result = thingRepository.findById(id);\r\n            cache.put(&quot;some_key&quot;, result);\r\n    \r\n            return result;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public String findNameById(long id) {\r\n            if(cache.has(&quot;some_other_key&quot;)) {\r\n                return cache.get(&quot;some_other_key&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n            String result = thingRepository.findNameById(id);\r\n            cache.put(&quot;some_other_key&quot;, result);\r\n    \r\n            return result;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public String findConfigBySomeParameter(String param) {\r\n            return thingRepository.findConfigBySomeParameter(param);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public Long findAnotherThingByAntoherParam(String param) {\r\n            return thingRepository.findAnotherThingByAntoherParam(param);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAs I said, I want to cache some method results, **but not all**. So in this case, `findAnotherThingByAntoherParam` and `findConfigBySomeParameter` aren&#39;t cached. While the other 2 are.\r\n\r\n`CachableThingRepository` isn&#39;t a good implementation. For starters the 2 non-cached methods shouldn&#39;t exist to begin with since they&#39;re not cached. From the outside, without looking at the code, one would assume that all methods are cached.\r\n\r\n**My question: how can I approach this?**\r\n==============\r\n\r\nMy solution is to simply remove the interface completely. Inject `ThingRepository` into `CachableThingRepository` and be left with something like this\r\n\r\n    public class CachableThingRepository{\r\n    \r\n        private ThingRepository thingRepository;\r\n        private Cache cache;\r\n    \r\n        public CachableThingRepository(ThingRepository thingRepository, Cache cache) {\r\n            this.thingRepository = thingRepository;\r\n            this.cache = cache;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public Map&lt;Long, String&gt; findById(long id) {\r\n            if(cache.has(&quot;some_key&quot;)) {\r\n                return cache.get(&quot;some_key&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n            Map&lt;Long, String&gt; result = thingRepository.findById(id);\r\n            cache.put(result);\r\n    \r\n            return result;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public String findNameById(long id) {\r\n            if(cache.has(&quot;some_other_key&quot;)) {\r\n                return cache.get(&quot;some_other_key&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n            String result = thingRepository.findNameById(id);\r\n            cache.put(result);\r\n    \r\n            return result;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhich in all fairness is considerably cleaner than the above.

You cannot list them as files.  They are just parts of a compressed archive.\r\n\r\nSo, how should you get the total number of images?  Easy—you already know.  You said yourself that you have 60 images, so just put something in your class like this:\r\n\r\n    private static final int IMAGE_COUNT = 60;\r\n\r\nYou have another problem here:\r\n\r\n    InputStream is = getClass().getResourceAsStream(&quot;/res/moon/&quot; + i + 1 + &quot;.png&quot;);\r\n\r\nIf you add this line right before it:\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;/res/moon/&quot; + i + 1 + &quot;.png&quot;);\r\n\r\nYou will see that it’s not doing what you intended.  The `+` operator works left-to-right, so no mathematical addition is taking place.  You can easily fix it with parentheses:\r\n\r\n    InputStream is = getClass().getResourceAsStream(&quot;/res/moon/&quot; + (i + 1) + &quot;.png&quot;);\r\n    //              math is performed before string concatenation  ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑\r\n\r\nIf you look at the documentation for [the methods of ImageIO](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/imageio/ImageIO.html#method-summary), you will see there is a read(URL) method.  This is much easier to use when loading resources:\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; IMAGE_COUNT; i++) {\r\n        URL imageLocation = getClass().getResource(&quot;/res/moon/&quot; + (i + 1) + &quot;.png&quot;);\r\n        moonIdle[i] = ImageIO.read(imageLocation);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNo need to worry about closing an InputStream.

If you can’t load an image, you certainly don’t want to keep going as if nothing’s wrong.\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; IMAGE_COUNT; i++) {\r\n            URL imageLocation = getClass().getResource(&quot;/res/moon/&quot; + (i + 1) + &quot;.png&quot;);\r\n            moonIdle[i] = ImageIO.read(imageLocation);\r\n        }\r\n    } catch (IOException e) {\r\n        e.printStackTrace();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFinally, I assume your application will not work properly without those images loaded, since there won’t be much for a user to see.  Instead of ignoring an IOException, treat it as a fatal error.\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; IMAGE_COUNT; i++) {\r\n            String resourcePath = &quot;/res/moon/&quot; + (i + 1) + &quot;.png&quot;;\r\n\r\n            URL imageLocation = getClass().getResource(resourcePath);\r\n\r\n            if (imageLocation == null) {\r\n                throw new RuntimeException(\r\n                    &quot;Missing image in application: &quot;\r\n                    + &quot;\\&quot;&quot; + resourcePath + &quot;\\&quot;&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            moonIdle[i] = ImageIO.read(imageLocation);\r\n\r\n            if (moonIdle[i] == null) {\r\n                throw new RuntimeException(\r\n                    &quot;Invalid image in application at &quot; + imageLocation);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    } catch (IOException e) {\r\n        throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Cannot load internal image!&quot;, e);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNotice that the above code does not just call printStackTrace in its catch block and keep going as if nothing’s wrong.

Install JDK21 on the machine and tell Gradle to use it as its toolchain.  \r\nIn your Gradle build file (build.gradle or build.gradle.kts):\r\n    ```Groovy\r\n    java {\r\n\t    toolchain {\r\n\t\t    languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(21)\r\n\t    }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Gradle should find your JDK21 installation [automatically][1].\r\n\r\n2. Install a JDK version *below 21* and use it to execute your Gradle tasks:  \r\nEither point your JAVA_HOME variable to this lower version JDK installation, or point the property `org.gradle.java.home` (gradle.properties) to it. If you use IntelliJ, you should instead point the setting &#39;Gradle JVM&#39; to this JDK.\r\n\r\nTo upgrade Gradle to 8.4, either download it from [gradle.org][2] and install it manually or (preferably) update your gradle-wrapper.properties file with `distributionUrl=https\\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.4-bin.zip`.  \r\n\r\n\\\r\nExplanation: by default, Gradle uses the same JDK that it runs on to compile your sources. Obviously that is not going to work when you need to compile Java 21 code but the latest Gradle release doesn&#39;t run on Java 21 yet.  \r\nSo you let Gradle run on a lower version (either your environment default - what is returned by *java --version*, or some other JDK as specified for instance in the *Gradle JVM* option of IntelliJ or by setting org.gradle.java.home in gradle.properties) but you instruct it to use a 21 JDK for building your project (compilation, javadoc generation, etc.).\r\n\r\n\\\r\n`Edit`: Despite [claims][3] to the contrary by Gradle, it seems that (at least for simple projects) Gradle 8.4 is already able to run on Java 21.  \r\nIf you run into problems use the steps above, but it should be enough to simply run `gradle build`/`gradlew build` with JDK21 and Gradle 8.4 (so step 2 can be skipped).  \r\nStarting with Gradle 8.5 it should be officially supported to run Gradle directly on JDK21.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html#sec:auto_detection\r\n  [2]: https://gradle.org/next-steps/?version=8.4&amp;format=bin\r\n  [3]: https://docs.gradle.org/8.4/release-notes.html#support-for-building-projects-with-java-21","title":"Starting from which version does Gradle support Java 21?","body":"<p>As mentioned in other answers, Gradle 8.4 supports building Java 21 projects.</p>\n<p>As to <em>how</em> to do that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Install JDK21 on the machine and tell Gradle to use it as its toolchain.<br />\nIn your Gradle build file (build.gradle or build.gradle.kts):</p>\n<pre><code>java {\n    toolchain {\n        languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(21)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Gradle should find your JDK21 installation <a href=\"https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html#sec:auto_detection\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">automatically</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Install a JDK version <em>below 21</em> and use it to execute your Gradle tasks:<br />\nEither point your JAVA_HOME variable to this lower version JDK installation, or point the property <code>org.gradle.java.home</code> (gradle.properties) to it.

In the end, writing code is a craft - and thus, opinions differ on how what excellence in the craft looks like (So, yes, &#39;software engineer&#39; as a term is very badly incorrect, instead &#39;software artisan&#39; is a lot closer to how software development is actually done. One can lament that or celebrate it - that&#39;s beyond this question and probably beyond what SO is for. I&#39;m merely stating how things _are_, not how they should be).\r\n\r\nBut first...\r\n\r\n## Why `printf` over `println` at all?\r\n\r\nThere are a number of reasons to use `printf` over `println`. The obvious one, is that you want the output string to be a template, i.e. whenever it gets more complex than literally `&quot;%d&quot;` or `&quot;%f&quot;`, i.e. you end up with `(&quot;Hello, %s, welcome to %s! There are %d before you in line&quot;, userName, serverName, queueSize)`, it&#39;s obvious `printf` is superior in this regard.\r\n\r\nBut it&#39;s not _just_ about that in the present - after all, in your code, that&#39;s simply not at all the case. All that is currently needed is, evidently, `&quot;%d&quot;`.\r\n\r\nA second reason is if you need to format a thing. For example, while `&quot;%d&quot;` and `&quot;%s&quot;` rarely change anything, `&quot;%f&quot;` almost always does: You really should never print a double or float value, you __must__ control the process of converting value (which tends to have small rounding errors in it. For example, 0.1 __does not exist__. Seriously, it doesn&#39;t. For the same reason 1/3 does not exist in decimal (try it, write it down on a piece of paper), 0.1 doesn&#39;t exist as computers count in binary and anything whose divisor doesn&#39;t consist solely of factors of 2, doesn&#39;t exist). You can still print it fine but that&#39;s because `System.out.println` applies a very light bit of rounding. More usually you want better control over this, hence, this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.out.printf(&quot;%.6f&quot;, someDoubleValue);\r\n```\r\n\r\nis __definitely__ useful, nay, _required_, in contrast to `System.out.print(someDoubleValue)`.\r\n\r\nThe same logic applies to `%20s` for example. But, this, too, does not __currently__ apply to your situation.\r\n\r\n## The future is a moving target\r\n\r\nMost software isn&#39;t released-and-done. This is &#39;weird&#39; - if a carpenter produces a table they tend to sell it and move on to another project. Software isn&#39;t really like that - the vast majority of this is modified almost continuously throughout its lifetime. Hence, __ability to be easily modified__ is an important property of a software project: Projects whose code doesn&#39;t lend itself well to updates, __is bad code__, for the simple reason that it&#39;s going to happen sooner rather than later, and thus, the code that is better &#39;prepared&#39;. It&#39;s like a cupboard you intend to disassemble and move later: Then you should buy a cupboard that is screwed together with good screws, instead of one with screws you&#39;re going to strip during assembly, or, even worse, a cupboard that you have to glue together.\r\n\r\nVirtually __all__ software is like &#39;a cupboard you will have to disassemble a lot&#39; - there is very little market for throwaway software that you build, use, and discard entirely.\r\n\r\n## Craftmanship\r\n\r\nThis gets us to craftmanship: It&#39;s a useful skill to be able to build software. Specifically, in a world where almost everybody wants disassemblable cupboards, it&#39;s not useful to learn the skill of efficiently glueing cupboards together. It&#39;s much more useful to be really good at building screwed-together ones.\r\n\r\nIf learning the craft is really difficult to do, it makes sense to optimize for the useful, common tasks, especially if those serve well enough for alternate, lesser requirements. Hence, good programmers optimize for writing good code, __even if__ there is no foreseeable need for e.g. code that can easily be modified later. For the same reason someone tasked to build a cupboard that will be used and discarded, might still use screws, because they aren&#39;t expensive and they know how to build cupboards that way, so, why not?\r\n\r\n## But.. inefficient!\r\n\r\nLudicrous. You will not be able to measure any performance difference here.

It&#39;s actively silly to worry about the irrelevant; programming is hard enough without making up rules that neither requirements nor the general need to write good software actually requires you to adhere to.","title":"Why would you use &#39;&quot;%d&quot;, variable&#39; when you can simply type the variable name?","body":"<p>Consistency with the present <strong>and</strong> consistency with the future.</p>\n<p>Whether you <em>agree</em> that it is wise to do this, is one of those endless 'opinions about the right way to write code' debates. In the end, writing code is a craft - and thus, opinions differ on how what excellence in the craft looks like (So, yes, 'software engineer' as a term is very badly incorrect, instead 'software artisan' is a lot closer to how software development is actually done. One can lament that or celebrate it - that's beyond this question and probably beyond what SO is for. I'm merely stating how things <em>are</em>, not how they should be).</p>\n<p>But first...</p>\n<h2>Why <code>printf</code> over <code>println</code> at all?</h2>\n<p>There are a number of reasons to use <code>printf</code> over <code>println</code>. The obvious one, is that you want the output string to be a template, i.e. whenever it gets more complex than literally <code>&quot;%d&quot;</code> or <code>&quot;%f&quot;</code>, i.e. you end up with <code>(&quot;Hello, %s, welcome to %s! There are %d before you in line&quot;, userName, serverName, queueSize)</code>, it's obvious <code>printf</code> is superior in this regard.</p>\n<p>But it's not <em>just</em> about that in the present - after all, in your code, that's simply not at all the case. All that is currently needed is, evidently, <code>&quot;%d&quot;</code>.</p>\n<p>A second reason is if you need to format a thing. For example, while <code>&quot;%d&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;%s&quot;</code> rarely change anything, <code>&quot;%f&quot;</code> almost always does: You really should never print a double or float value, you <strong>must</strong> control the process of converting value (which tends to have small rounding errors in it. For example, 0.1 <strong>does not exist</strong>. Seriously, it doesn't. For the same reason 1/3 does not exist in decimal (try it, write it down on a piece of paper), 0.1 doesn't exist as computers count in binary and anything whose divisor doesn't consist solely of factors of 2, doesn't exist). You can still print it fine but that's because <code>System.out.println</code> applies a very light bit of rounding. More usually you want better control over this, hence, this:</p>\n<pre><code>System.out.printf(&quot;%.6f&quot;, someDoubleValue);\n</code></pre>\n<p>is <strong>definitely</strong> useful, nay, <em>required</em>, in contrast to <code>System.out.print(someDoubleValue)</code>.</p>\n<p>The same logic applies to <code>%20s</code> for example. But, this, too, does not <strong>currently</strong> apply to your situation.</p>\n<h2>The future is a moving target</h2>\n<p>Most software isn't released-and-done. This is 'weird' - if a carpenter produces a table they tend to sell it and move on to another project. Software isn't really like that - the vast majority of this is modified almost continuously throughout its lifetime. Hence, <strong>ability to be easily modified</strong> is an important property of a software project: Projects whose code doesn't lend itself well to updates, <strong>is bad code</strong>, for the simple reason that it's going to happen sooner rather than later, and thus, the code that is better 'prepared'. It's like a cupboard you intend to disassemble and move later: Then you should buy a cupboard that is screwed together with good screws, instead of one with screws you're going to strip during assembly, or, even worse, a cupboard that you have to glue together.</p>\n<p>Virtually <strong>all</strong> software is like 'a cupboard you will have to disassemble a lot' - there is very little market for throwaway software that you build, use, and discard entirely.</p>\n<h2>Craftmanship</h2>\n<p>This gets us to craftmanship: It's a useful skill to be able to build software. Specifically, in a world where almost everybody wants disassemblable cupboards, it's not useful to learn the skill of efficiently glueing cupboards together. It's much more useful to be really good at building screwed-together ones.</p>\n<p>If learning the craft is really difficult to do, it makes sense to optimize for the useful, common tasks, especially if those serve well enough for alternate, lesser requirements. Hence, good programmers optimize for writing good code, <strong>even if</strong> there is no foreseeable need for e.g. code that can easily be modified later. For the same reason someone tasked to build a cupboard that will be used and discarded, might still use screws, because they aren't expensive and they know how to build cupboards that way, so, why not?</p>\n<h2>But.. inefficient!</h2>\n<p>Ludicrous. You will not be able to measure any performance difference here. It's a fair argument if the job requires &quot;good performance&quot; based on something specific (just 'it needs to perform well' is far too nebulous a requirement), and it's a fair argument even if the job does not require that now but it is foreseeable that in the future this code will grow some requirements (i.e. needs to be modified), and one of these requirements is 'it needs to perform well'.</p>\n<p>But, any objective measure you care to come up with that is at all related to real life requirements will not disqualify this code for being 'too inefficient', hence, worrying about that is like worrying about an errant pencil mark on a side of wood paneling that will be invisible once a cupboard is built.
