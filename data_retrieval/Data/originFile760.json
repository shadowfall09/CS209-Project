And in the body of <code>ResponseEntiry&lt;Object&gt;</code> produced by the method <code>RestTemplate.exchange()</code> you have a <code>LinkedHashMap</code> in the guise of <code>Object</code>, it's <strong>not a raw JSON</strong> (if you want to know why it is a <code>LinkedHashMap</code>, well because that's how Jackson stores information, and it's a subclass of <code>Object</code> like any other class in Java). And sure, when you're invoking <code>toString()</code> on any implementation of the <code>Map</code> you'll get <code>=</code> between a Key and a Value.</p>\n<p>So, the problem you've mentioned in the updated question is artificial.</p>\n<p>If you want to deal with a <code>Map</code> instead of an object with properly typed properties and here's how you can do that:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();\n        \nResponseEntity&lt;LinkedHashMap&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; response = restTemplate.exchange(\n    sfdcURL, HttpMethod.POST, entity, new ParameterizedTypeReference&lt;&gt;() {}\n);\n    \nMap&lt;String, Object&gt; resMap = response.getBody();\n    \nList&lt;Object&gt; recordsList = (List&lt;Object&gt;) resMap.get(&quot;records&quot;);\n    \nif (recordsList.isEmpty()) { ... }\n</code></pre>\n<p>If there are redundant lines in the Values which you want to trim, then as a remedy you can introduce a custom Jackson-module declaring a Deserializer which would handle leading/trailing white-space and new lines, described in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/33765854/17949945\"><em>this answer</em></a>. Deserialize in the module would be applied by default, other options would require creating classes representing domain objects which you for some reasons want to avoid.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":17108660,"reputation":1251,"user_id":12380096,"display_name":"AylaWinters"},"score":0,"creation_date":1672757116,"post_id":74973516,"comment_id":132343345,"body_markdown":"Thank you, I did think about &quot;extracting&quot; via regex, but I&#39;m not sure my boss will go for that because of it not being bulletproof.

To make it work, you should\r\n\r\n 1. configure cache provider\r\n 2. tell hibernate what entities to cache (right in hbm.xml file if you use this kind of mapping). \r\n\r\nYou tell to the cache provider how many objects it should store and when/why they should be invalidated. So let&#39;s say you have a Book and an Author entities, each time you&#39;re getting them from the DB, only those that are not in cache will be selected from actually DB. This increases performance significantly. It&#39;s useful when:\r\n\r\n - You write to the database only via Hibernate (because it needs a way to know when to change or invalidate entities in the cache)\r\n - You read objects often\r\n - You have a single node, and you don&#39;t have replication. Otherwise you&#39;ll need to replicate the cache itself (use distributed caches like JGroups) which adds more complexity, and it doesn&#39;t scale as good as share-nothing apps.\r\n\r\nSo when does cache work?\r\n\r\n - When you `session.get()` or `session.load()` the object that was previously selected and resides in cache. Cache is a storage where ID is the key and the properties are the values. So only when there is a possibility to search by ID you could eliminate hitting the DB.\r\n - When your associations are lazy-loaded (or eager-loaded with selects instead of joins)\r\n\r\nBut it doesn&#39;t work when:\r\n\r\n - If you don&#39;t select by ID. Again - 2nd level cache stores a map of entities&#39; IDs to other properties (it doesn&#39;t actually store objects, but the data itself), so if your lookup looks like this: `from Authors where name = :name`, then you don&#39;t hit cache.\r\n - When you use HQL (even if you use `where id = ?`). \r\n - If in your mapping you set `fetch=&quot;join&quot;`, this means that to load associations joins will be used everywhere instead of separate select statements. Process level cache works on children objects only if `fetch=&quot;select&quot;` is used.\r\n - Even if you have `fetch=&quot;select&quot;` but then in HQL you use joins to select associations - those joins will be issued right away and they will overwrite whatever you specified in hbm.xml or annotations.\r\n\r\nNow, about Query Cache. You should note that it&#39;s not a separate cache, it&#39;s an addition to the process level cache. Let&#39;s say you have a Country entity. It&#39;s static, so you know that each time there will be the same result set when you say `from Country`. This is a perfect candidate for query cache, it will store a list of *IDs* in itself and when you next time select all countries, it will return this list to the process level cache and the latter, in turn, will return objects for each ID as these objects are stored already in the 2nd level cache.\r\nQuery cache is invalidated each time anything related to the entity changes. So let&#39;s say you configured `from Authors` to be placed into a Query Cache. It won&#39;t be effective as Author changes often.

Hibernate actually has four different cache strategies:</p>\n\n<p><strong>READ_ONLY</strong>: Objects don’t change once inside the cache.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE</strong>: Objects change (eventually) after the corresponding database entry is updated; this guarantees eventual consistency.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>READ_WRITE</strong>: Objects change (immediately) after the corresponding database entry is updated; this guarantees strong consistency by using \"soft\" locks.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>TRANSACTIONAL</strong>: Objects change using distributed XA transactions, ensuring data integrity; this guarantees either total success or rolling back all changes.\nIn all four of these cases, though, updating a single database entry would not invalidate the entire list of customers in the cache. Hibernate is a little smarter than that :)</p>\n\n<p>To learn more about how L2 caching works in Hibernate, you can check out the article “What is the Hibernate L2 cache,” or the in-depth article <a
