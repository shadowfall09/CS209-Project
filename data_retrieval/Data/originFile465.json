I&#39;m having issues connecting to my Kafka container from my microservice container. Everything runs nice and smoothly when I run the application locally, but when I start it using ```docker-compose up -d``` that is when the issues arise. So far I&#39;ve tried creating a docker network, thinking that doing so would enable to containers to communicate with one another. Secondly, I&#39;ve tried adding the Kafka bootstrap server URL to the Docker container, and that also did not work. \r\n\r\nLike the stack trace for the microservice docker container states, there is an issue with my ```bootstrap.server URLs ``` setting, but I can&#39;t exactly put my finger on what the issue actually is. Looking for some guidance, or even just another set of eyes on this issue. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ll attach the Kafka and microservice docker-compose file, application.properties file, and also the stack trace below in that order. I should also add that I tried using the IP address of the Kafka docker container. \r\n\r\nThanks, everyone.\r\n\r\n**Kafka docker-compose.yml**\r\n```\r\nversion: &#39;3&#39;\r\nservices:\r\n  zookeeper:\r\n    image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:latest\r\n    container_name: zookeeper\r\n    environment:\r\n      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181\r\n      ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME: 2000\r\n    networks:\r\n      -

For\n  these types of tasks, Callable is a better abstraction: it expects\n  that the main entry point, call, will return a value and anticipates\n  that it might throw an exception.7 Executors includes several utility\n  methods for wrapping other types of tasks, including Runnable and\n  java.security.PrivilegedAction, with a Callable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":277571,"reputation":1676,"user_id":571653,"accept_rate":68,"display_name":"abhihello123"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1574776444,"creation_date":1574776444,"answer_id":59052495,"question_id":3929342,"body_markdown":"Just adding to the accepted answer-\r\n\r\n&gt; However, exceptions thrown from tasks make it to the uncaught\r\n&gt; exception handler only for tasks submitted with execute(); for tasks\r\n&gt; submitted with submit() to the executor service, any thrown exception\r\n&gt; is considered to be part of the task’s return status.\r\n\r\n[Source][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://medium.com/@aozturk/how-to-handle-uncaught-exceptions-in-java-abf819347906","title":"Choose between ExecutorService&#39;s submit and ExecutorService&#39;s execute","body":"<p>Just adding to the accepted answer-</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However, exceptions thrown from tasks make it to the uncaught\n  exception handler only for tasks submitted with execute(); for tasks\n  submitted with submit() to the executor service, any thrown exception\n  is considered to be part of the task’s return status.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@aozturk/how-to-handle-uncaught-exceptions-in-java-abf819347906\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":27431,"reputation":46866,"user_id":72437,"accept_rate":86,"display_name":"Cheok Yan Cheng"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":112594,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":213,"accepted_answer_id":3986509,"answer_count":7,"score":213,"last_activity_date":1682939668,"creation_date":1287018658,"question_id":3929342,"body_markdown":"How should I choose between **ExecutorService&#39;s** [submit][1] or [execute][2], if the returned value is not my concern? \r\n\r\nIf I test both, I didn&#39;t see any differences among the two except the returned value.\r\n\r\n    ExecutorService threadExecutor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();\r\n    threadExecutor.execute(new Task());\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n    ExecutorService threadExecutor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();\r\n    threadExecutor.submit(new Task());\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html#submit-java.util.concurrent.Callable-\r\n\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executor.html#execute-java.lang.Runnable-","title":"Choose between ExecutorService&#39;s submit and ExecutorService&#39;s execute","body":"<p>How should I choose between <strong>ExecutorService's</strong> <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html#submit-java.util.concurrent.Callable-\" rel=\"noreferrer\">submit</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executor.html#execute-java.lang.Runnable-\" rel=\"noreferrer\">execute</a>, if the returned value is not my concern? </p>\n\n<p>If I test both, I didn't see any differences among the two except the returned value.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ExecutorService threadExecutor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();\nthreadExecutor.execute(new Task());\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<pre><code>ExecutorService threadExecutor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();\nthreadExecutor.submit(new Task());\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","unit-testing","mockito","spy"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":6440378,"reputation":184,"user_id":4990575,"display_name":"Kurojin"},"score":0,"creation_date":1682866964,"post_id":76141592,"comment_id":134279200,"body_markdown":"It feels like you are rather trying to unit test SupportClass.populateMap instead of MyClass.method.\nMyClass.method only responsability is to call supportClass.pomulateMap with the right map, that is all there is to test, you can use Mockito.verify to ensure the populateMap has been called with the right parameter","body":"It feels like you are rather trying to unit test SupportClass.populateMap instead of MyClass.method.

Or to convert the return value to something like JSONObject?</p>\n<p>I would be interested in any other Java lib that can do remove/modify element by json path.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","swagger","springfox"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":10308879,"reputation":517,"user_id":7605320,"display_name":"Marco"},"score":1,"creation_date":1612808147,"post_id":66106854,"comment_id":116877078,"body_markdown":"are you using @EnableSwagger2? and also try to use `io.springfox:springfox-swagger2:3.0.0`","body":"are you using @EnableSwagger2? and also try to use <code>io.springfox:springfox-swagger2:3.0.0</code>"},{"owner":{"account_id":18904876,"reputation":123,"user_id":13792203,"display_name":"Jack"},"score":0,"creation_date":1612809729,"post_id":66106854,"comment_id":116877672,"body_markdown":"@Marco I added annotation EnableSwagger2 to my SwaggerConfig file and I don&#39;t have any errors but in the Swagger guide that I attached by the link in the post says that after configuring you should go to this url : &#39;http://localhost:8080/spring-security-rest/api/v2/api-docs&#39; and when I got this url, I have nothing, maybe I did something wrong..","body":"@Marco I added annotation EnableSwagger2 to my SwaggerConfig file and I don&#39;t have any errors but in the Swagger guide that I attached by the link in the post says that after configuring you should go to this url : &#39;<a href=\"http://localhost:8080/spring-security-rest/api/v2/api-docs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">localhost:8080/spring-security-rest/api/v2/api-docs</a>&#39; and when I got this url, I have nothing, maybe I did something wrong.."},{"owner":{"account_id":18904876,"reputation":123,"user_id":13792203,"display_name":"Jack"},"score":0,"creation_date":1612810034,"post_id":66106854,"comment_id":116877775,"body_markdown":"To verify that Springfox is working, we can visit this URL in our browser:\n\nhttp://localhost:8080/spring-security-rest/api/v2/api-docs\n\nThe result is a JSON response with a large number of key-value pairs, which is not very human readable.

In both cases, my vectorized methods were incredibly slow compared to their scalar equivalents.</p>\n<p>Here's my code:</p>\n<pre><code>public class SIMDParse {\n\nprivate static IntVector mul = IntVector.fromArray(\n        IntVector.SPECIES_512,\n        new int[] {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1000000000, 100000000, 10000000, 1000000, 100000, 10000, 1000, 100, 10, 1},\n        0\n);\nprivate static byte zeroChar = (byte) '0';\nprivate static int width = IntVector.SPECIES_512.length();\nprivate static byte[] filler;\n\nstatic {\n    filler = new byte[16];\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 16; i++) {\n        filler[i] = zeroChar;\n    }\n}\n\npublic static int parseInt(String str) {\n    boolean negative = str.charAt(0) == '-';\n    byte[] bytes = str.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n    if (negative) {\n        bytes[0] = zeroChar;\n    }\n    bytes = ensureSize(bytes, width);\n    ByteVector vec = ByteVector.fromArray(ByteVector.SPECIES_128, bytes, 0);\n    vec = vec.sub(zeroChar);\n    IntVector ints = (IntVector) vec.castShape(IntVector.SPECIES_512, 0);\n    ints = ints.mul(mul);\n    return ints.reduceLanes(VectorOperators.ADD) * (negative ? -1 : 1);\n}\n\npublic static byte[] ensureSize(byte[] arr, int per) {\n    int mod = arr.length % per;\n    if (mod == 0) {\n        return arr;\n    }\n    int length = arr.length - (mod);\n    length += per;\n    byte[] newArr = new byte[length];\n    System.arraycopy(arr, 0, newArr, per - mod, arr.length);\n    System.arraycopy(filler, 0, newArr, 0, per - mod);\n    return newArr;\n}\n\npublic static byte[] ensureSize2(byte[] arr, int per) {\n    int mod = arr.length % per;\n    if (mod == 0) {\n        return arr;\n    }\n    int length = arr.length - (mod);\n    length += per;\n    byte[] newArr = new byte[length];\n    System.arraycopy(arr, 0, newArr, 0, arr.length);\n    return newArr;\n}\n\npublic static int indexOf(String s, char c) {\n    byte[] b = s.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n    int width = ByteVector.SPECIES_MAX.length();\n    byte bChar = (byte) c;\n    b = ensureSize2(b, width);\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; b.length; i += width) {\n        ByteVector vec = ByteVector.fromArray(ByteVector.SPECIES_MAX, b, i);\n        int pos = vec.compare(VectorOperators.EQ, bChar).firstTrue();\n        if (pos != width) {\n            return pos + i;\n        }\n    }\n    return -1;\n}\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I fully expected my int parsing to be slower, since it won't ever be handling more than the vector size can hold (an int can never be more than 10 digits long).</p>\n<p>By my bechmarks, parsing <code>123</code> as an int 10k times took 3081 microseconds for <code>Integer.parseInt</code>, and 80601 microseconds for my implementation. Searching for <code>'a'</code> in a very long string (<code>&quot;____&quot;.repeat(4000) + &quot;a&quot; + &quot;----&quot;.repeat(193)</code>) took 7709 microseconds to <code>String#indexOf</code>'s 7.</p>\n<p>Why is it so unbelievably slow? I thought the entire point of SIMD is that it's faster than the scalar equivalents for tasks like these.</p>\n"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":9760,"page":465,"page_size":100}
