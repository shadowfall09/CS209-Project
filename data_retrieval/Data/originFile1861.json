the only issue is that &quot;ORDER BY&quot; statement didn&#39;t seem to affect this &quot;child list&quot; &#39;s sorting.

Anything in the @Query that doesn&#39;t affect the parents that are retrieved is not considered when retrieving the children. Hence, you have no control over the ORDER.\r\n\r\nPerhaps consider a CourseWithTeachers approach, but then you have no control over the ORDER of the Teachers. The alternative is to use @Embedded for the parent and the child but you then have to process the result which is the caretesian product i.e. a result for each parent/child combination.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/j2spu.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/SDb8I.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/tptBZ.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q2XzL.png","title":"How can I filter composite ManyToMany POJOs by children POJO&#39;s attributes?","body":"<p>I believe that your issue is due to the <strong>column names being duplicated</strong> and  basically room selecting the incorrect values (I believe it uses the last so it would be using the course id column value for the teacher id).</p>\n<p>That is the query (with the JOINS) will consist of columns:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>id (Teacher),</li>\n<li>name (Teacher),</li>\n<li>teacher_id,</li>\n<li>course_id,</li>\n<li>id (Course),</li>\n<li>name (Course)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So let's say you have the following in the database :-</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/j2spu.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/j2spu.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SDb8I.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SDb8I.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tptBZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tptBZ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>And the following is used (LiveData not used to brevity and convenience) :-</p>\n<pre><code>    for(Course c: dao.getAllCourses()) {\n        for (TeacherWithCourses tbc: dao.getTeachersByCourseId(c.id)) {\n            Log.d(&quot;TEACHER&quot;,&quot;Teacher is &quot;

Throwing an exception is a valid exit for a method, though with checked exceptions this would change the method signature of course.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":23301404,"reputation":1,"user_id":17381987,"display_name":"Carlos H"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1636599691,"creation_date":1636593934,"answer_id":69922177,"question_id":42564745,"body_markdown":"    import java.util.*;\r\n    \r\n    public class Prueba {\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    \r\n            String currency = &quot;USD&quot;;\r\n            System.out.println(findCurrencyRate(currency));\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public static double findCurrencyRate(String Currency) {\r\n    \r\n            String text = &quot;EUR 1.65 \\n USD 8.56 \\n YEN 0.34&quot;;\r\n            Scanner file = new Scanner(text);\r\n            file.useLocale(Locale.US);\r\n    \r\n            while (file.hasNextLine()) {\r\n    \r\n                String line = file.nextLine();\r\n                Scanner linea = new Scanner(line);\r\n                linea.useLocale(Locale.US);\r\n                \r\n    \r\n                if(linea.next().equals(Currency)) {\r\n                    double currencyValue = linea.nextDouble();\r\n                    return currencyValue;\r\n                }\r\n    \r\n            }\r\n            return 0;\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    }","title":"Why is my java method not working?

Upper case `YY` for year is wrong. Upper case `Y` is for week-based year and only useful with a week number. For year you would need lower case `y` with `SimpleDateFormat`.

But there is not always a convenient way to look up the key, given the key (I&#39;m pretty sure Python makes it hard, C++ makes it easy (just ask for an iterator), this question is about Java, which I suspect as as bad as Python).  At first this may sound dumb: why would you need to look up a key you already have?  But consider something like this (example below uses `Set` instead of `Map`, but same idea):\r\n\r\n    TreeSet&lt;String&gt; dictionary = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;(String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);\r\n    dictionary.add(&quot;Monday&quot;); // populate dictionary\r\n    String word = &quot;MONDAY&quot;; // user input, or something\r\n    if(dictionary.contains(word)) System.out.println(word + &quot; already in dictionary&quot;);\r\n\r\nThe above code snippet will print `MONDAY already in dictionary`.  This is of course wrong, because &quot;MONDAY&quot; is not in the dictionary; rather, &quot;Monday&quot; is.  How can we make the message more accurate?  In this case, we can make a help function that take advantage of the fact that a `TreeSet` is a `NavigableSet`  (Actually a similar trick works for `SortedSet`, though it&#39;s a bit less convenient.):\r\n\r\n    String lookup(NavigableSet&lt;String&gt; set, String key) {\r\n        assert set.contains(key) : key + &quot; not in set&quot;;\r\n        return set.floor(key);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow we can fix the last line of the previous code snippet:\r\n\r\n    if(dictionary.contains(word)) System.out.println(lookup(word) + &quot; already in dictionary&quot;);\r\n\r\nWhich will print the correct thing.  But now let&#39;s try an example with a hash set:\r\n\r\n    import java.util.HashSet;\r\n    /** Maintains a set of strings; useful as a replacement for String.intern() */\r\n    class StringInterner {\r\n        private final HashSet&lt;String&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\r\n        /** use this instead of String.intern() */\r\n        String intern(String s) {\r\n             if(!set.contains(s)) {\r\n                 s.add(s);\r\n                 return s;\r\n             }\r\n             for(String str : set) // linear scan!!\r\n                 if(str.equals(s)) return str;\r\n             throw new AssertionError(&quot;something went very wrong&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe code above resorts to a linear scan to find something that it already knows is there.  Note that `HashSet` could easily give us what we&#39;re looking for, because it needs to be able to do this just to implement `contains()`.  But there&#39;s no API for it, so we can&#39;t even ask the question.  (Actually, `HashMap` has an internal method called `getNode` which is pretty much what we want, but it is internal.)  An easy workaround in this case is to use a map instead of a set: instead of `set.add(s)` we could instead use `map.put(s,s)`.  But what if we&#39;re already using a map, because we already have data we want to associate with our key?  Then we can either use two maps, and carefully keep them in sync, or else store a tuple of size 2 as the &quot;value&quot; in our map, where the first item in the tuple is simply the map key.  Both of these solutions seem needlessly awkward.\r\n\r\nIs there a better way?","title":"lookup key by key in Java map or set","body":"<p>In most languages, including Java, there is an API something like <code>java.util.Map</code> which is designed to make it easy to loop up a value, given the key that maps to it.  But there is not always a convenient way to look up the key, given the key (I'm pretty sure Python makes it hard, C++ makes it easy (just ask for an iterator), this question is about Java, which I suspect as as bad as Python).  At first this may sound dumb: why would you need to look up a key you already have?  But consider something like this (example below uses <code>Set</code> instead of <code>Map</code>, but same idea):</p>\n<pre><code>TreeSet&lt;String&gt; dictionary = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;(String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);\ndictionary.add(&quot;Monday&quot;); // populate dictionary\nString word = &quot;MONDAY&quot;; // user input, or something\nif(dictionary.contains(word)) System.out.println(word + &quot; already in dictionary&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above code snippet will print <code>MONDAY already in dictionary</code>.  This is of course wrong, because &quot;MONDAY&quot; is not in the dictionary; rather, &quot;Monday&quot; is.  How can we make the message more accurate?  In this case, we can make a help function that take advantage of the fact that a <code>TreeSet</code> is a <code>NavigableSet</code>  (Actually a similar trick works for <code>SortedSet</code>, though it's a bit less convenient.):</p>\n<pre><code>String lookup(NavigableSet&lt;String&gt; set, String key) {\n    assert set.contains(key) : key + &quot; not in set&quot;;\n    return set.floor(key);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we can fix the last line of the previous code snippet:</p>\n<pre><code>if(dictionary.contains(word)) System.out.println(lookup(word) + &quot; already in dictionary&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which will print the correct thing.  But now let's try an example with a hash set:</p>\n<pre><code>import java.util.HashSet;\n/** Maintains a set of strings; useful as a replacement for String.intern() */\nclass StringInterner {\n    private final HashSet&lt;String&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\n    /** use this instead of String.intern() */\n    String intern(String s) {\n         if(!set.contains(s)) {\n             s.add(s);\n             return s;\n         }\n         for(String str : set) // linear scan!!\n             if(str.equals(s)) return str;\n         throw new AssertionError(&quot;something went very wrong&quot;);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The code above resorts to a linear scan to find something that it already knows is there.  Note that <code>HashSet</code> could easily give us what we're looking for, because it needs to be able to do this just to implement <code>contains()</code>.  But there's no API for it, so we can't even ask the question.  (Actually, <code>HashMap</code> has an internal method called <code>getNode</code> which is pretty much what we want, but it is internal.)  An easy workaround in this case is to use a map instead of a set: instead of <code>set.add(s)</code> we could instead use <code>map.put(s,s)</code>.  But what if we're already using a map, because we already have data we want to associate with our key?  Then we can either use two maps, and carefully keep them in sync, or else store a tuple of size 2 as the &quot;value&quot; in our map, where the first item in the tuple is simply the map key.  Both of these solutions seem needlessly awkward.</p>\n<p>Is there a better way?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","maven"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":22354823,"reputation":16499,"user_id":16572295,"display_name":"Jo&#227;o Dias"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1636587054,"creation_date":1636587054,"answer_id":69921444,"question_id":69921404,"body_markdown":"Yes, you can&#39;t include any dependencies as JARs.

The compiler implicitly creates a constructor, the getters, `hashCode` &amp; `equals`, and `toString`. \r\n\r\nNotice that the getter methods implicitly defined in a record do *not* begin with the [JavaBeans][3]-style `get…` wording. The getter method is simply the name of member field as defined in the parentheses following the class name. \r\n\r\nOf course, if your getter methods provide access to an object that is itself mutable, being contained in a record does nothing to stop the calling programmer from mutating the contained object. Notice in the example class next that both `String` and `LocalDate` classes are themselves immutable by design. So the mutability of a contained object is a non-issue here.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage org.example;\r\n\r\nimport java.time.LocalDate;\r\n\r\npublic record Planet( String name , LocalDate discovered )\r\n{\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing that record.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nPlanet Earth = new Planet( &quot;Earth&quot; , LocalDate.of( 2020 , 1 , 16 ) );\r\n\r\nSystem.out.println( &quot;Earth&quot; );\r\nSystem.out.println( &quot;------------------------------------&quot; );\r\nSystem.out.println( &quot;Earth.name: &quot; + Earth.name() );\r\nSystem.out.println( &quot;Earth.discovered: &quot; + Earth.discovered() );\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen run.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nEarth\r\n------------------------------------\r\nEarth.name: Earth\r\nEarth.discovered: 2020-01-16\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Class\r\n\r\nWithout the records feature, to make sure a class is immutable you should:\r\n\r\n- Mark the member fields `final`. This means the field cannot be assigned a different object after the constructor has finished.\r\n- Mark the member fields `private`.

The `LinkedHashMap` doesn&#39;t expose the reference to the internal `LinkedList` either.\r\n\r\n&gt; The actual *&quot;Linked List&quot;* behavior is implementation specific. Some\r\n&gt; may actually use an instance of `LinkedList` some many just have\r\n&gt; `Entry` track a previous and next `Entry` and use that as its\r\n&gt; implementation.
