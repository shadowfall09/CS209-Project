Don&#39;t import libraries you don&#39;t use:\r\n\r\n    * e.g. controlsfx/formsfx/validatorfx/ikonli/bootstrapfx/tilesfx.  \r\n\r\n 2. If you don&#39;t know Gradle or Maven, choose Maven when using [the idea new JavaFX project wizard](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/javafx.html).\r\n\r\n    * Maven is likely easier to learn and understand for a simple project.  \r\n\r\n 3. If your project is modular when adding a 3rd party dependency like mongo, you also need to update your `module-info.java` file to `require` the new module.\r\n\r\n     * By default, the Idea new JavaFX project wizard will create a `module-info.java` file which makes your project modular.\r\n\r\n 4. To determine the module name of the required module you can check if the library has a module-info in its [source repository](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver) or binary jar and use that.\r\n\r\n 5. If there is no module-info, as in this case, it will be an [automatic module](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46741907/what-is-an-automatic-module).\r\n\r\n 6. If it is an automatic module you can find out the module name from an `Automatic-Module-Name` manifest header in the jar, if that is defined.\r\n\r\n 7. If no manifest header is defined, you can find out the module name from the jar name, according to the steps in the automatic module documentation linked.\r\n\r\n 8. Possibly, you will need to add other statements to the module-info such as `opens` or `exports` clauses.  \r\n\r\n    * You will know this because you will receive runtime errors when trying to use the code from the dependent module.  These runtime errors will inform you that you have access errors due to the constraints of the Java module system.\r\n\r\nEven when you do all of the above, some libraries may not work as Java platform modules because they are not coded to work. In which case, you should run them the libraries off of the classpath.  Probably it is best in such a case to make your project non-modular (while keeping the JavaFX libraries as modules on the module path). To do so, delete the `module-info.java` file and use VM arguments to allow access to the JavaFX modules. For more information on such a configuration, study the documentation on non-modular projects as openjfx.io, specifically the section [non-modular with Maven](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#IDE-Intellij).  However, only do this if you fail or it is too inconvenient to get the project to work as a modular project.\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t understand information in the above steps, study both tutorials for:\r\n\r\n 1. Your chosen build system.\r\n 2. The Java module system.\r\n 3. How to adapt your project to use the Java module system.\r\n 4. How to use your build system to work with the Java module system.\r\n\r\nIf this is difficult (and it may be), you can contact the vendor of the third-party library and request assistance in getting the library to work as a Java platform module.\r\n\r\n**Specifically for MongoDB**\r\n\r\nI did try the above steps with the MongoDB java client libraries.  After doing so, I came to the conclusion that it is best (currently) to use MongoDB from JavaFX with your project in a non-modular mode (i.e., without `module-info.java` defined in your project).\r\n\r\nThis is because as of MongoDB 4.5.1:\r\n\r\n 1. MongoDB can only be used as automatic modules because it does not provide appropriate module-info.\r\n\r\n 2. The MongoDB client comes in multiple jars and splits its package definitions across jars.\r\n\r\n     * This split-package definition across multiple jars is a configuration not allowed by the Java platform module system as far as I can tell.\r\n     * package `com.mongodb` has classes defined in both `mongodb-driver.jar` and `mongodb-driver-core.jar`.\r\n\r\n**Here is a non-modular setup for mongodb+JavaFX**\r\n\r\nAll files were generated by the Idea New JavaFX project wizard and some modifications were made as outlined below (non-modified files are not listed).\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t use MongoDB and don&#39;t have a MongoDB server setup, so I just verified that the below configuration compiles and tries to connect to a server (then fails to connect due to no server running).\r\n\r\nTo ease setup, during wizard definition, I chose the JDK: &quot;liberica-18 BellSoft Liberica version 18&quot;.  This is Liberica&#39;s &quot;full JDK&quot; version that includes the JavaFX modules in its base JDK distribution so I don&#39;t need to define command-line switches to enable JavaFX at compile and runtime (which is a painful and error-prone process).\r\n\r\nBy default, the MongoDB java client does not ship with a logging implementation.

These runtime errors will inform you that you have access errors due to the constraints of the Java module system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Even when you do all of the above, some libraries may not work as Java platform modules because they are not coded to work. In which case, you should run them the libraries off of the classpath.  Probably it is best in such a case to make your project non-modular (while keeping the JavaFX libraries as modules on the module path). To do so, delete the <code>module-info.java</code> file and use VM arguments to allow access to the JavaFX modules. For more information on such a configuration, study the documentation on non-modular projects as openjfx.io, specifically the section <a href=\"https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#IDE-Intellij\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">non-modular with Maven</a>.  However, only do this if you fail or it is too inconvenient to get the project to work as a modular project.</p>\n<p>If you don't understand information in the above steps, study both tutorials for:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your chosen build system.</li>\n<li>The Java module system.</li>\n<li>How to adapt your project to use the Java module system.</li>\n<li>How to use your build system to work with the Java module system.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If this is difficult (and it may be), you can contact the vendor of the third-party library and request assistance in getting the library to work as a Java platform module.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifically for MongoDB</strong></p>\n<p>I did try the above steps with the MongoDB java client libraries.  After doing so, I came to the conclusion that it is best (currently) to use MongoDB from JavaFX with your project in a non-modular mode (i.e., without <code>module-info.java</code> defined in your project).</p>\n<p>This is because as of MongoDB 4.5.1:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>MongoDB can only be used as automatic modules because it does not provide appropriate module-info.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The MongoDB client comes in multiple jars and splits its package definitions across jars.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This split-package definition across multiple jars is a configuration not allowed by the Java platform module system as far as I can tell.</li>\n<li>package <code>com.mongodb</code> has classes defined in both <code>mongodb-driver.jar</code> and <code>mongodb-driver-core.jar</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Here is a non-modular setup for mongodb+JavaFX</strong></p>\n<p>All files were generated by the Idea New JavaFX project wizard and some modifications were made as outlined below (non-modified files are not listed).</p>\n<p>I don't use MongoDB and don't have a MongoDB server setup, so I just verified that the below configuration compiles and tries to connect to a server (then fails to connect due to no server running).</p>\n<p>To ease setup, during wizard definition, I chose the JDK: &quot;liberica-18 BellSoft Liberica version 18&quot;.  This is Liberica's &quot;full JDK&quot; version that includes the JavaFX modules in its base JDK distribution so I don't need to define command-line switches to enable JavaFX at compile and runtime (which is a painful and error-prone process).</p>\n<p>By default, the MongoDB java client does not ship with a logging implementation.  To get logs from the client, you need to include a logging implementation dependency.  For this example, I chose to include slf4j-simple as the logging implementation, you could replace that with another compatible library if you wish.</p>\n<p>MongoDB client access code was copied from a <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/java/sync/current/quick-start/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MongoDB quick start tutorial</a>, but it is using a local access URL rather than a clustered service URL instead of an Atlas cloud-hosted MongoDB instance.</p>\n<p><em>module-info.java</em></p>\n<p>File deleted.</p>\n<p><em>pom.xml</em></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

It is most likely possible - but needs more setup (on a techincal level: we need a docker wormhole to start containers from a container, this means root provileges,...)"},{"owner":{"account_id":8943248,"reputation":121,"user_id":7947996,"display_name":"Sebi"},"score":1,"creation_date":1650051874,"post_id":71887930,"comment_id":127032910,"body_markdown":"And from now on I have posts like this one: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/310307/mocking-vs-test-db which I can read.

Something like (pseudo-code):</p>\n\n<pre><code>def validateStuff():\n    if stuff is not valid:\n        return WTF\n    return OK\n\ndef saveBookings():\n    rc = validateStuff()\n    if rc != OK:\n        return rc;\n    save the information\n    return OK\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You'll still likely have exceptions caught by your call to <code>saveBookings</code> if only to handle I/O errors and the like, but it's not <em>absolutely</em> necessary: you could catch those exception within the function as well and translate them to a return code.</p>\n\n<p>I tend to like one reporting method from each function so I (for example) don't have to <code>try/catch</code> <em>and</em> check return codes.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":62111,"reputation":40153,"user_id":184730,"accept_rate":72,"display_name":"fastcodejava"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1312257777,"creation_date":1312257777,"answer_id":6907125,"question_id":6907023,"body_markdown":"It is not a good idea to put lot of code into one place.

Here is the solution with just minor changes that I've come up with:</p>\n<pre><code>import java.util.Scanner;\npublic class Drawtriangle {\n\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    Scanner scanner=new Scanner(System.in);\n    System.out.print(&quot;Enter increment amount:&quot;);\n    int incAmt=scanner.nextInt();\n    System.out.print(&quot;Enter number of terms in the sequence:&quot;);\n    int numOfTerms=scanner.nextInt();\n    int number=1;\n    for(int row=1; row&lt;=10;row++) {       \n        for(int col=1; col&lt;=row; col++) {     \n            System.out.print(number+&quot; &quot;);\n            number = number + 5 ;\n            if(number&gt;31){\n                number = 1;\n            }\n        }\n        System.out.println();\n    }\n    scanner.close();\n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The output is also here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3N9fK.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CORRECT OUTPUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CORERCTLOGIC</a></p>\n<p>Hope you can are able to solve this now.

For example, should the utterance ID I provide to the <code>TextToSpeech.speak()</code> function need to be in some special format that I'm missing?</p>\n\n<pre><code>mtts = new TextToSpeech(myAct, new TextToSpeech.OnInitListener() {\n    @Override\n    public void onInit(int status) {\n        if (status == TextToSpeech.SUCCESS) {\n            mtts.setLanguage(Locale.US);\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nmtts.setOnUtteranceProgressListener(new UtteranceProgressListener() {\n    @Override\n    public void onDone(String utteranceId) {\n        Toast.makeText(myAct, \"OnDone called\", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onError(String utteranceId) {\n        Toast.makeText(myAct, \"OnError called\", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onStart(String utteranceId) {\n        Toast.makeText(myAct, \"OnStart called\", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\n    }\n});\n\nBundle params = new Bundle();\nparams.putString(TextToSpeech.Engine.KEY_PARAM_UTTERANCE_ID, \"\");\nmyAct.mtts.speak(myText, TextToSpeech.QUEUE_FLUSH, params, \"MyID\");\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":8904821,"reputation":324,"user_id":6647053,"display_name":"Zachary"},"score":1,"creation_date":1649987775,"post_id":71878971,"comment_id":127017937,"body_markdown":"Think about it this way.

But, there are ways you can do it with minor API bloat. I&#39;ve listed 3 potential solutions below in relative order of complexity (based on my opinion). I think #2 is probably what you&#39;ll want though.\r\n\r\n1) I know you don&#39;t want them, but please reconsider. If you are defining the class that you want to listen to, this will provide the least API bloat, and best performance. However, I can think of at least two reasons this wouldn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\n     - You are using a 3rd party library that doesn&#39;t provide a listener interface. You could get around this by sub-classing or decorating, but I understand why you wouldn&#39;t want to do this as there could potentially be a lot of classes you&#39;d need to do it for.\r\n     - You are writing a 3rd party library, and don&#39;t know which fields the client programs will need to listen to (This is what I&#39;m doing today actually). If this is the case, you may need to get more creative.\r\n\r\n2) Write a persistor class that uses reflection to change the field values, then trigger listeners. This will probably be the closest to what you want actually. The code would look like this.\r\n```\r\npublic static void setFieldValue(Object instance, Field field, Object value) throws IllegalArgumentException {\r\n    // Provide some mechanism to get the listeners.\r\n    final Collection&lt;Consumer&lt;Object&gt;&gt; listeners = getListeners();\r\n\r\n    // Save the accessible flag before modifying it so that we can clean up after ourselves.\r\n\tfinal boolean accessible = field.isAccessible();\r\n\ttry {\r\n        // Update accessible flag in case the field is not public\r\n\t\tif (!field.canAccess(instance)) {\r\n\t\t\tfield.setAccessible(true);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tfield.set(instance, value);\r\n\r\n        // Trigger Listeners\r\n        for (Consumer&lt;Object&gt; listener : listeners) {\r\n            listener.accept(value);\r\n        }\r\n\t} finally {\r\n\t\tfield.setAccessible(accessible);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTo make it easier to use, you could instead pass in a `String` instead of a `Field`, but be careful about how you retrieve the field by name. `instance.getClass().getField(fieldName)` will return public fields along the whole hierarchy, while `instance.getClass().getDeclaredField(fieldName)` will return private fields only on the actual class of `instance`.\r\n\r\n3) Another method could be to use proxies. This would work well if you are using 3rd party code with well-defined interfaces as a proxy will behave like the class you are creating it off of, but will give you a mechanism to intercept any method calls that would change its state. The implementation would look something like this.\r\n```\r\npublic class ProxyFactory {\r\n    public static &lt;T&gt; T getProxy(T instance) {\r\n        // Provide some mechanism to get the listeners.\r\n        final Collection&lt;Consumer&lt;Object&gt;&gt; listeners = getListeners();\r\n        // Create the Proxy\r\n        return (T) Proxy.newProxyInstance(\r\n                instance.getClass().getClassLoader(),\r\n                instance.getClass().getInterfaces(),\r\n                new ProxyListenerTrigger&lt;T&gt;(instance, listeners));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static class ProxyListenerTrigger&lt;T&gt; implements InvocationHandler {\r\n\r\n        private final T instance;\r\n        private final Collection&lt;Consumer&lt;Object&gt;&gt; listeners;\r\n\r\n        public ProxyListenerTrigger(T instance, Collection&lt;Consumer&lt;Object&gt;&gt; listeners) {\r\n            this.instance = instance;\r\n            this.listeners = listeners;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args) throws Throwable {\r\n            Object result = method.invoke(instance, args);\r\n            Object value = setterValueOf(method, args);\r\n            if (value != null) {\r\n                for (Consumer&lt;Object&gt; listener : listeners) {\r\n                    listener.accept(value);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            return result;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private static Object setterValueOf(Method method, Object[] args) {\r\n            // Some way of determining if the method being called is a setter\r\n            if (method.getName().contains(&quot;set&quot;)) {\r\n                return args[0];\r\n            } else {\r\n                return null;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","title":"java Field change listener","body":"<p>I can't think of a way to do this without some form of API bloat.

This would require that this method takes in a Reader (instead of a `String` which cannot be streamed), and would return an `InputStream` instead of a `byte[]`. Of course if the input is not particularly large, there is no need. The above approach is somewhat wasteful - both the base64-ed data, _and_ the un-base64ed data, _and_ the decompressed data is all in memory at the same time and you can&#39;t avoid this nor can the garbage collector collect any of this stuff in between (because the caller continues to ref that base64-ed string most likely).\r\n\r\nIn other words, if the compressed ratio is, say, 50%, and the total uncompressed data is 100MB in size, this method takes MORE than:\r\n\r\n100MB (uncompressed ) + 50MB (compressed) + 50*4/3 = 67MB (compressed but base64ed) = ~ 217MB of memory.\r\n\r\nYou know better than we do how much heap your VM is running on, and how large the input data is likely to ever get.\r\n\r\nNB: Base64 transfer is extremely inefficient, taking 4 bytes of base64 content for every 3 bytes of input data, and if the data transfer is in UTF-16, it&#39;s 8 bytes per 3, even. Ouch. Given that the content was GZipped, this feels a bit daft: First we painstakingly reduce the size of this thing, and then we casually inflate it by 33% for probably no good reason. You may want to check the &#39;pipe&#39; that leads you to this, possibly you can just... eliminate the base64 aspect of this.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have a wire protocol and someone decided that JSON was a good idea, then.. simply.. don&#39;t. JSON is not a good idea if you have the need to transfer a bunch of raw data.

The above approach is somewhat wasteful - both the base64-ed data, <em>and</em> the un-base64ed data, <em>and</em> the decompressed data is all in memory at the same time and you can't avoid this nor can the garbage collector collect any of this stuff in between (because the caller continues to ref that base64-ed string most likely).</p>\n<p>In other words, if the compressed ratio is, say, 50%, and the total uncompressed data is 100MB in size, this method takes MORE than:</p>\n<p>100MB (uncompressed ) + 50MB (compressed) + 50*4/3 = 67MB (compressed but base64ed) = ~ 217MB of memory.</p>\n<p>You know better than we do how much heap your VM is running on, and how large the input data is likely to ever get.</p>\n<p>NB: Base64 transfer is extremely inefficient, taking 4 bytes of base64 content for every 3 bytes of input data, and if the data transfer is in UTF-16, it's 8 bytes per 3, even. Ouch. Given that the content was GZipped, this feels a bit daft: First we painstakingly reduce the size of this thing, and then we casually inflate it by 33% for probably no good reason. You may want to check the 'pipe' that leads you to this, possibly you can just... eliminate the base64 aspect of this.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have a wire protocol and someone decided that JSON was a good idea, then.. simply.. don't. JSON is not a good idea if you have the need to transfer a bunch of raw data. Use protobuf, or send a combination of JSON and blobs, etc.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":6365238,"reputation":172,"user_id":4939411,"accept_rate":50,"display_name":"Jo Dung"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":701,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":71885952,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1650036986,"creation_date":1650035428,"question_id":71885725,"body_markdown":"I have been trying to implement decompressing text compressed in GZIP format\r\nBelow we have method I implemented \r\n\r\n    private byte[] decompress(String compressed) throws Exception {\r\n    \tByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\r\n\t    ByteArrayInputStream in = new \r\n            ByteArrayInputStream(compressed.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));\r\n\t    GZIPInputStream ungzip = new GZIPInputStream(in);\r\n\t    byte[] buffer = new byte[256];\r\n\t    int n;\r\n\t    while ((n = ungzip.read(buffer)) &gt;= 0) {\r\n\t\t    out.write(buffer, 0, n);\r\n\t    }\r\n    \treturn out.toByteArray();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd now I am testing the solution for following compressed text:\r\n\r\n    H4sIAAAAAAAACjM0MjYxBQAcOvXLBQAAAA==\r\n\r\nAnd there is Not a gzip format exception.\r\nI tried different ways but there still is this error.

If you want to satisfy a condition with a probability of <em>P,</em> it should be true for <em>P</em> ⋅ <em>N</em> elements from the set of <em>N</em> possibilties.</p>\n<p>Since zero is counted as one of the elements, the maximum result value that should be <em>included</em> is ( <em>P</em> ⋅ <em>N</em> − 1 ) / <em>N</em>. Or, in other words, we should <em>exclude</em>  <em>P</em> ⋅ <em>N</em> / <em>N</em>, i.e., <em>P.</em></p>\n<p>That exclusion of <em>P</em> is what leads to the use of <code>&lt;</code>.</p>\n<p>It might be easier to reason about when you consider how you'd use a method like <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ThreadLocalRandom.html#nextInt-int-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>nextInt()</code>,</a> There, the effect of zero on a small range is more obvious, and your expression would clearly use the <code>&lt;</code> operator: <code>current().nextInt(5) &lt; 3</code>. That wouldn't change if you divide the result: <code>current().nextInt(5) / 5.0 &lt; 0.6</code>. The difference between <code>nextInt(5) / 5.0</code> and <code>random()</code> is only that the latter has many more, much smaller steps between 0 and 1.</p>\n<p>I apologize for misleading people with my original answer, and thank <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/270986\">the user</a> who straightened me out.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":446208,"reputation":8611,"user_id":839128,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"MikeFHay"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1649875027,"creation_date":1649875027,"answer_id":71862387,"question_id":71859473,"body_markdown":"Use `&lt;`.
