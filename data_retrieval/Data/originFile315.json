It creates a `JPanel` with a `FlowLayout`, adds both application sections to it, and sets this panel as the content pane of the main `JFrame`.\r\n\r\nThe `createFirstAppSection` and `createSecondAppSection` methods return `JPanel` instances that represent the UI sections of your first and second applications, respectively. \r\n\r\n- The `createFirstAppSection` method should include the logic from your first application that creates the single-column table and adds it to a `JPanel`, and \r\n- the `createSecondAppSection` method should include the logic from your second application that creates the two-column layout and adds it to a `JPanel`.\r\n\r\nThat way, both of your applications will be displayed side by side in the same window, thanks to the `FlowLayout` of the main panel.\r\n\r\nThe [`GridBagLayout`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/gridbag.html) and a `GridBagConstraints` object set the constraints for each component. The `fill` field is set to `GridBagConstraints.HORIZONTAL` to allow components to fill their cells horizontally. The `weightx` field is set to `0.5` to distribute extra horizontal space evenly between the two columns.\r\n\r\nFor each label and field,  the `gridx` and `gridy` fields are set to specify the cell in the grid where the component should be placed. For labels, `gridx` is 0 (the first column) and for fields, `gridx` is 1 (the second column). The `gridy` value is increased for each new row.\r\n\r\nThe `addMnemonics` method is used the same as in your original code. \r\n\r\nThe result should be a two-column layout, similar to the one created with `GroupLayout`. The specifics of the layout can be adjusted by changing the[ `GridBagConstraints`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/gridbag.html#gridbagConstraints). For example, you can set `insets` to add padding around components, `ipadx` and `ipady` to set the internal padding of the components, and `anchor` to specify where in the cell the component should be placed if it does not fill the cell entirely.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n&gt;  You wrote both of your applications will be displayed side by side in the same window, thanks to the `FlowLayout` of the main panel.  \r\nHow do I display my application one below the other? Which layout should I choose?\r\n\r\nIf you want to display your applications one below the other, you should use the [`BoxLayout` layout manager](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/box.html) with a `BoxLayout.PAGE_AXIS` or `BoxLayout.Y_AXIS` orientation. That layout manager will arrange your components in a single column, top to bottom.\r\n\r\nHere is how you can modify the main panel to use a `BoxLayout`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// main panel with BoxLayout\r\nJPanel mainPanel = new JPanel();\r\nBoxLayout boxlayout = new BoxLayout(mainPanel, BoxLayout.Y_AXIS);\r\nmainPanel.setLayout(boxlayout);\r\nmainPanel.add(app1Panel);\r\nmainPanel.add(app2Panel);\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust replace the creation of the `mainPanel` in your combined application with this code, and the two applications should appear one below the other. Note that the `BoxLayout` constructor takes two parameters: the container that it is applied to, and the axis along which the components will be arranged.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n&gt; How do I shorten the vertical space between two applications (one above, one below)? \r\n\r\nYou can control the vertical space between components in a `BoxLayout` using a [`Border`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/border.html) to the panels or directly inserting a rigid area between them.\r\n\r\n## Option 1: Using Borders\r\n\r\nYou can add an empty border to the bottom of the first application panel and the top of the second one to decrease the space between them.  \r\nAs an example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\napp1Panel.setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(0, 0, 5, 0)); // add a 5-pixel padding to the bottom\r\napp2Panel.setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(5, 0, 0, 0)); // add a 5-pixel padding to the top\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Option 2: Inserting a Rigid Area\r\n\r\nYou can also use [`Box.createRigidArea(Dimension d)`](http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0240__Swing/CreatingRigidAreasStrut.htm) to add a fixed space between the two panels.  \r\nFor instance, to create a space of 5 pixels, you can do:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nmainPanel.add(Box.createRigidArea(new Dimension(0, 5)));\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure to add this line after adding `app1Panel` and before adding `app2Panel` to `mainPanel`. You can adjust the height in the `Dimension` argument to control the spacing.\r\n\r\nThese approaches give you fine control over the spacing between components, allowing you to achieve the precise layout you want.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n&gt; I&#39;m missing something. I&#39;ve changed the code to what follows but I still have a huge gap. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; ``` java\r\n&gt; final JPanel app1Panel = createFirstAppSection();\r\n&gt; final JPanel app2Panel = createSecondAppSection();\r\n&gt; // main panel with BoxLayout\r\n&gt; final JPanel mainPanel = new JPanel();\r\n&gt; final BoxLayout boxlayout = new BoxLayout(mainPanel, BoxLayout.Y_AXIS);\r\n&gt; mainPanel.setLayout(boxlayout);\r\n&gt; mainPanel.add(app1Panel);\r\n&gt; mainPanel.add(Box.createRigidArea(new Dimension(0, 5)));\r\n&gt; mainPanel.add(app2Panel);\r\n&gt; ```\r\n\r\nFirst, make sure that the panels `app1Panel` and `app2Panel` do not have any extra space or padding that could cause the large gap. If these panels use a layout manager, ensure that the layout is not adding any extra space.\r\n\r\nAnd make sure the `BoxLayout` is not stretching the components. By default, `BoxLayout` will stretch components to fill the available space in the box&#39;s axis. If your `app1Panel` or `app2Panel` contains fewer components or uses a layout that does not use all the available space, it could be causing the gap. In this case, consider setting the maximum size of your components:\r\n\r\n```java\r\napp1Panel.setMaximumSize(app1Panel.getPreferredSize());\r\napp2Panel.setMaximumSize(app2Panel.getPreferredSize());\r\n```\r\nBefore adding them to the `mainPanel`.\r\n\r\nIf the above two points do not seem to be the cause, it might be the way the `mainPanel` is being added to its parent component or how the parent component&#39;s layout is set up. If the parent component of `mainPanel` is set up with a layout manager that stretches its child components, it could cause the `mainPanel` (and all its child components) to be stretched, creating the gap. \r\n\r\nConsider also using debugging methods to isolate the problem. One common method is setting the background color of different components to see exactly where the extra space is. That can help you identify whether the problem is in `app1Panel`, `app2Panel`, or `mainPanel`.\r\n","title":"Combine single column mode with two column mode in Swing","body":"<p>You can combine (as commented) both applications into one and add them to a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/panel.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>JPanel</code></a> with a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/flow.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>FlowLayout</code></a>.<br />\nFor instance, you can define a new class named <code>CombinedApplication</code> that includes the logic from both of your previous applications, and include a <code>createUI</code> method to set up the main UI.

I am very confused as to why this happens so i really need help what follows is the code I use:</p>\n<p>This is the code for adding the grid items and changing the image buttons src</p>\n<pre><code>    package com.example.rpg_app;\n\n    import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;\n\n    import android.content.Intent;\n    import android.graphics.Color;\n    import android.os.Bundle;\n    import android.view.View;\n    import android.widget.AdapterView;\n    import android.widget.GridView;\n    import android.widget.ImageButton;\n    import android.widget.ImageView;\n\n    import com.example.rpg_app.databinding.ActivityMainBinding;\n\npublic class ChooseIconActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n\n    ActivityMainBinding binding;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_choose_icon);\n\n        int[] iconIds = {\n                R.drawable.image_0, R.drawable.image_1, R.drawable.image_2, R.drawable.image_3, R.drawable.image_4,\n                R.drawable.image_5, R.drawable.image_6, R.drawable.image_7, R.drawable.image_8, R.drawable.image_9,\n                R.drawable.image_10, R.drawable.image_11, R.drawable.image_12, R.drawable.image_13, R.drawable.image_14,\n                R.drawable.image_15, R.drawable.image_16, R.drawable.image_17, R.drawable.image_18, R.drawable.image_19,\n                R.drawable.image_20, R.drawable.image_21, R.drawable.image_22, R.drawable.image_23, R.drawable.image_24,\n                R.drawable.image_25, R.drawable.image_26, R.drawable.image_27, R.drawable.image_28, R.drawable.image_29,\n                R.drawable.image_30, R.drawable.image_31, R.drawable.image_32, R.drawable.image_33, R.drawable.image_34,\n                R.drawable.image_35, R.drawable.image_36, R.drawable.image_37, R.drawable.image_38, R.drawable.image_39,\n                R.drawable.image_40, R.drawable.image_41, R.drawable.image_42, R.drawable.image_43, R.drawable.image_44,\n                R.drawable.image_45, R.drawable.image_46, R.drawable.image_47, R.drawable.image_48, R.drawable.image_49,\n                R.drawable.image_50, R.drawable.image_51, R.drawable.image_52, R.drawable.image_53, R.drawable.image_54,\n                R.drawable.image_55, R.drawable.image_56, R.drawable.image_57, R.drawable.image_58, R.drawable.image_59,\n                R.drawable.image_60, R.drawable.image_61, R.drawable.image_62, R.drawable.image_63, R.drawable.image_64,\n                R.drawable.image_65, R.drawable.image_66, R.drawable.image_67, R.drawable.image_68, R.drawable.image_69,\n                R.drawable.image_70, R.drawable.image_71, R.drawable.image_72, R.drawable.image_73, R.drawable.image_74,\n                R.drawable.image_75, R.drawable.image_76, R.drawable.image_77, R.drawable.image_78, R.drawable.image_79,\n                R.drawable.image_80, R.drawable.image_81\n        };\n\n        GridView gridView = findViewById(R.id.gridView);\n        GridAdapter gridAdapter = new GridAdapter(ChooseIconActivity.this, iconIds);\n        gridView.setAdapter(gridAdapter);\n\n\n        gridView.setOnItemClickListener(new AdapterView.OnItemClickListener() {\n            @Override\n            public void onItemClick(AdapterView&lt;?&gt; adapterView, View view, int i, long l) {\n                ImageButton imageButton = findViewById(R.id.iconBtn);\n                imageButton.setImageResource(iconIds[i]);\n            }\n        });\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the code from create task activity:</p>\n<pre><code>    package com.example.rpg_app;\n\n    import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;\n\n    import android.content.Intent;\n    import android.graphics.drawable.Drawable;\n    import android.os.Bundle;\n    import android.view.View;\n    import android.widget.ImageButton;\n\n    public class CreateTaskActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n\n        ImageButton imageButton;\n\n        @Override\n        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n            setContentView(R.layout.activity_create_task_2);\n\n            imageButton = findViewById(R.id.iconBtn);\n\n            imageButton.setOnClickListener(v-&gt; chooseIcon());\n        }\n\n        void chooseIcon(){\n            startActivity(new Intent(CreateTaskActivity.this, ChooseIconActivity.class));\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>I had first implemented the logic to change the activity.

Use Spring Cloud binder for RabbitMQ. It supports reactive specification including receiving messages from MQ as Flux. There is zero code required to make all your scenarios work. For example, Spring WebFlux will read trace/span from request header and add it to request context. It will add this to outgoing remote calls including web calls and messages (rabbitMQ). It will read these headers on incoming messages and create span from same for any outgoing calls. All your scenarios will work out of box. You can debug this in logs if using MDC (logback etc.) as it adds trace information in MDC context and takes care of most of scenarios of context switching.\r\n 2. Instead of setting TraceContext in context, write specific ids like trace/span/parent etc directly in context and then add them to right header values when making downstream calls. Do not worry about context switches or which thread will execute webclient calls. If you simply set `Hooks.enableAutomaticContextPropagation();` in main class then with minimal overhead your context should be passed.\r\n\r\n 3. This is bit complex but I could not think of any easier solution. Create a custom io.micrometer.observation.transport.ReceiverContext and create a new Observation on same.

After consuming the RabbitMQ message I&#39;m fetching the `traceId` and writing it to the Reactor&#39;s Context using as `TraceContext`. My understanding is that this context will be used upstream in the reactive pipeline further on where the API calls are made. After doing multiple API calls the `WebClient` seems to generate a new `traceId` for each `.exchange()` which is not the behaviour I am expecting.\r\n\r\n**Question:** Is this even possible to achieve?

First, we declare two variables to hold the overlap in the x-axis and y-axis respectively.\r\n2. Next, we calculate the overlap in the x-axis:\r\n    1. We check if the left edge of rectangle 1 is to the left of the left edge of rectangle 2 AND the right edge of rectangle 1 is to the right of the left edge of rectangle 2. If this condition is true, then there is an overlap in the x-axis. \r\n    2. We then check if the right edge of rectangle 2 is entirely contained within rectangle 1. If it is, then the x-axis overlap is simply the width of rectangle 2. \r\n    3.
