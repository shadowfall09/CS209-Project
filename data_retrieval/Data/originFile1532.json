I tried to write a test for this particular use case of StreamBridge by following the examples from here ([https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/d8ed65a249ed4364b96d68f4f56b3d5b4de996a4/spring-cloud-stream/src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/stream/function/StreamBridgeTests.java#L716][1]) and adapt it for my above application.properties config and for some reason, the message received in the <strong>outputDestination is null</strong> for this test:</p>\n<pre><code>public class StreamBridgeTests {\n\n    @Test\n    public void testSendingMessageToDestination() {\n        try (ConfigurableApplicationContext context = new SpringApplicationBuilder(TestChannelBinderConfiguration\n                .getCompleteConfiguration(Application.class))\n                .web(WebApplicationType.NONE).run()) {\n\n            HelloEventAvro helloEventAvro = buildHelloEventAvro();\n\n            Message&lt;HelloEventAvro&gt; helloEventAvroMessage = MessageBuilder\n                    .withPayload(helloEventAvro)\n                    .setHeader(CustomKafkaHeaders.PARTITION_ID.value(), helloEventAvro.getId())\n                    .build();\n\n            StreamBridge bridge = context.getBean(StreamBridge.class);\n            bridge.send(&quot;user&quot;, helloEventAvroMessage);\n\n            OutputDestination outputDestination = context.getBean(OutputDestination.class);\n            Message&lt;byte[]&gt; message = outputDestination.receive(100, &quot;user&quot;);\n            assertThat(new String(message.getPayload())).contains(&quot;hello&quot;);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I dived deeper with debug and it seems that the outputDestination is created with one channel (myUserTopic.destination) and 2 messageQueues instead of 1, mentioned below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>user.destination</strong> with size 0 (where &quot;user&quot; = my bindingName)</li>\n<li><strong>myUserTopic.destination</strong> with size 1 and the helloEventAvroMessage produced</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I change the bindingName from &quot;user&quot; to the name of the kafka topic &quot;myUserTopic&quot; in the receive() method of OutputDestination, it works as expected: one channel is created (myUserTopic.destination) and 1 messageQueue (myUserTopic.destination):</p>\n<pre><code>public class StreamBridgeTests {\n\n    @Test\n    public void testSendingMessageToDestination() {\n        try (ConfigurableApplicationContext context = new SpringApplicationBuilder(TestChannelBinderConfiguration\n                .getCompleteConfiguration(Application.class))\n                .web(WebApplicationType.NONE).run()) {\n\n            HelloEventAvro helloEventAvro = buildHelloEventAvro();\n\n            Message&lt;HelloEventAvro&gt; helloEventAvroMessage = MessageBuilder\n                    .withPayload(helloEventAvro)\n                    .setHeader(CustomKafkaHeaders.PARTITION_ID.value(), helloEventAvro.getId())\n                    .build();\n\n            StreamBridge bridge = context.getBean(StreamBridge.class);\n            bridge.send(&quot;user&quot;, helloEventAvroMessage);\n\n            OutputDestination outputDestination = context.getBean(OutputDestination.class);\n            Message&lt;byte[]&gt; message = outputDestination.receive(100, &quot;myUserTopic&quot;);\n            assertThat(new String(message.getPayload())).contains(&quot;hello&quot;);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Considering the above, I still don't get how the bindingName from the send() method of StreamBridge works in correlation with the receive() method from OutputDestination (<em><strong>shouldn't be the same name in both places if I have only one topic?</strong></em> ) and how it is resolved to the kafka topic destination name set.</p>\n<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/d8ed65a249ed4364b96d68f4f56b3d5b4de996a4/spring-cloud-stream/src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/stream/function/StreamBridgeTests.java#L716\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream/blob/d8ed65a249ed4364b96d68f4f56b3d5b4de996a4/spring-cloud-stream/src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/stream/function/StreamBridgeTests.java#L716</a>)</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","mysql","excel","spring-boot"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":24200211,"reputation":16,"user_id":18158151,"display_name":"Kush Khanna"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1646810898,"creation_date":1646810541,"answer_id":71405653,"question_id":71376455,"body_markdown":"you need to add &#39;file&#39; (as per your code) in the key field (next to where you&#39;ve uploaded the file) in Postman.

If it is already <code>true</code>, then don't change it, and return <code>false</code> - that is <em>identical</em> to the negation of the above method - walk through all the cases if you're having a hard time seeing how that works).</p>\n<p>The only other method this class could have that isn't covered by the above and isn't the just-for-convenience <code>get()</code> is, I guess, <code>lazySet</code>.</p>\n<p>It would be useful perhaps, but only slightly so.</p>\n<p>One crazy solution would be to just let <code>AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater</code> work for boolean fields as well - they are really just full-word-size in all JVM impls I know of.

This is also better if you ever change your mind about whether a class should be public or not.</p>\n<p>Newer versions of <em>javac</em> can also produce a warning in this situation with <code>-Xlint:all</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>auxiliary class Baz in ./Bar.java should not be accessed from outside its own source file\n</code></pre>\n<p>Sometimes there really is a good reason why everybody does something in a particular way.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":102991,"reputation":378282,"user_id":276101,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"polygenelubricants"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":25,"is_accepted":false,"score":25,"last_activity_date":1267125691,"creation_date":1267124568,"answer_id":2336783,"question_id":2336692,"body_markdown":"I believe you simply call `PrivateImpl` what it is: a `non-public top-level class`.

As you say, the time to generate a hash value from a string might not itself be O(1) *in the length of the string* - though for some implementations it is: for example Microsoft&#39;s C++ `std::hash&lt;std::string&gt;` has:\r\n\r\n                size_t _Val = 2166136261U;\r\n                size_t _First = 0;\r\n                size_t _Last = _Keyval.size();\r\n                size_t _Stride = 1 + _Last / 10;\r\n\r\n                if (_Stride &lt; _Last)\r\n                        _Last -= _Stride;\r\n                for(; _First &lt; _Last; _First += _Stride)\r\n                        _Val = 16777619U * _Val ^ (size_t)_Keyval[_First];\r\n                return (_Val);\r\n\r\nThe `_Stride` is a tenth of the string length, so a *fixed* number of characters that far apart will be incorporated in the hash value.  Such a hash function is O(1) *in the length of the string*.\r\n\r\nGCC&#39;s C++ Standard library takes a different approach: in v4.7.2 at least, it calls down through a `_Hash_impl` support class to the `static` non-member function [`_Hash_bytes`](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/libsupc%2B%2B/hash_bytes.cc), which does a Murmur hash incorporating every byte.

Consequently, different compromises are struck by different compilers - even different versions of the same compiler.\r\n\r\nThe documentation David P&#233;rez Cabrera&#39;s answer links to explains the `hashCode` function in Java:\r\n\r\n&gt; Returns a hash code for this string. The hash code for a String object is computed as\r\n\r\n     s[0]*31^(n-1) + s[1]*31^(n-2) + ... + s[n-1]\r\n     \r\n\r\n&gt; using `int` arithmetic, where `s[i]` is the `i`&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; character of the string, `n` is the length of the string, and `^` indicates exponentiation. (The hash value of the empty string is zero.)\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s clearly O(N) in the length of the string.\r\n\r\nReturning quickly to...\r\n\r\n&gt; It&#39;s usually said that inserting and finding a string in a hashtable is O(1).\r\n\r\n...a &quot;key&quot; ;-P insight is that in many problem domains, the real-world lengths of the strings is known not to vary significantly, or hashing for the worst-case length is still plenty fast enough.  Consider a person&#39;s or company&#39;s name, a street address, an identifier from some source code, a programming-language keyword, a product/book/CD etc name: you can expect a billion keys to take roughly a million times more memory to store than the first thousand.  With a hash table, most operations on the entire data set can be expected to take a million times longer.  And this will be as true in 100 years&#39; time as it is today.  Importantly, if some request comes in related to a single key, it shouldn&#39;t take much longer to perform than it used to with a thousand keys (assuming sufficient RAM, and ignoring CPU caching effects) - though sure, if it&#39;s a long key it may take longer than for a short key, and if you have ultra-low-latency or hard-realtime requirements, you may care.  But, the average throughput for requests with random keys will be constant despite having a million times more data.\r\n\r\nOnly when you have a problem domain with massive variance in key size and the key-hashing time is significant given your performance needs, or where you expect the average key size to increase over time (e.g. if the keys are video streams, and every few years people are bumping up resolutions and frame rates creating an exponential growth in key size), will you need to pay close attention to the hashing (and key comparison) costs.","title":"Time complexity of creating hash value of a string in hashtable","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>It's usually said that inserting and finding a string in a hashtable is O(1).

The hash code for a String object is computed as</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code> s[0]*31^(n-1) + s[1]*31^(n-2) + ... + s[n-1]\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>using <code>int</code> arithmetic, where <code>s[i]</code> is the <code>i</code><sup>th</sup> character of the string, <code>n</code> is the length of the string, and <code>^</code> indicates exponentiation. (The hash value of the empty string is zero.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's clearly O(N) in the length of the string.</p>\n\n<p>Returning quickly to...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It's usually said that inserting and finding a string in a hashtable is O(1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...a \"key\" ;-P insight is that in many problem domains, the real-world lengths of the strings is known not to vary significantly, or hashing for the worst-case length is still plenty fast enough.  Consider a person's or company's name, a street address, an identifier from some source code, a programming-language keyword, a product/book/CD etc name: you can expect a billion keys to take roughly a million times more memory to store than the first thousand.  With a hash table, most operations on the entire data set can be expected to take a million times longer.  And this will be as true in 100 years' time as it is today.  Importantly, if some request comes in related to a single key, it shouldn't take much longer to perform than it used to with a thousand keys (assuming sufficient RAM, and ignoring CPU caching effects) - though sure, if it's a long key it may take longer than for a short key, and if you have ultra-low-latency or hard-realtime requirements, you may care.  But, the average throughput for requests with random keys will be constant despite having a million times more data.</p>\n\n<p>Only when you have a problem domain with massive variance in key size and the key-hashing time is significant given your performance needs, or where you expect the average key size to increase over time (e.g. if the keys are video streams, and every few years people are bumping up resolutions and frame rates creating an exponential growth in key size), will you need to pay close attention to the hashing (and key comparison) costs.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":13466635,"reputation":126,"user_id":9716647,"display_name":"Md Ashraful Islam"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1583597479,"creation_date":1583597479,"answer_id":60579569,"question_id":31549669,"body_markdown":"The complexity of a hashing function is never O(1).

Note how Java inserts a `checkcast` instruction after the method call to `method`, i.e. after `invokevirtual`. This performs a type-check on the returned value, which is currently on top of the stack. Since it&#39;s a `String` and it&#39;s cast to `Integer`, you get a `ClassCastException`.\r\n\r\nIt does not do that for the first two lines which don&#39;t use the result.\r\n\r\n**This is why your code fails only when you actually use the result like you do.**\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nI would have assumed that Java inserts this cast whenever you make use of the fact that `T` is `Integer` to verify that `method` actually did return something of type `T` as best it can to fail early.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s another example:\r\n    \r\n    Main.&lt;Integer&gt;method(Integer.class).toString();\r\n      33: ldc           #7   // class java/lang/Integer\r\n      35: invokestatic  #9   // Method method:(Ljava/lang/Class;)Ljava/lang/Object;\r\n      38: checkcast     #7   // class java/lang/Integer\r\n      41: invokevirtual #19  // Method java/lang/Integer.toString:()Ljava/lang/String;\r\n      44: pop\r\n\r\nThe compiler knows that the `.toString()` call is being placed on something of type `Integer`, so it places a virtual call directly to `Integer`&#39;s version of this method. Of course the compiler needs insert a check to ensure the returned value (which could be anything at runtime) conforms to `Integer`, so it inserts another `checkcast` instruction.\r\n\r\nHowever, even when using a class that doesn&#39;t override Object&#39;s `toString`, Java still inserts a `checkcast`:\r\n\r\n    Main.&lt;Main&gt;method(Main.class).toString();\r\n      45: ldc           #6   // class Main\r\n      47: invokestatic  #3   // Method method:(Ljava/lang/Class;)Ljava/lang/Object;\r\n      50: checkcast     #6   // class Main\r\n      53: invokevirtual #7   // Method java/lang/Object.toString:()Ljava/lang/String;\r\n      56: pop\r\n\r\nDespite targeting a method that exists for all objects with essentially choosing the static receiver type to be `Object`, Java still inserts `checkcast`.\r\n\r\nWhen we cast the returned value to `Object` by ourselves, however, Java does not add any `checkcast` whatsoever and the call can go through.\r\n\r\n------------\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s back off a little and think about what we&#39;ve been doing. We&#39;re not looking at Java per se, we&#39;ve been looking at bytecode. \r\n\r\nJava is defined by the Java Language Specification.

Of course the compiler needs insert a check to ensure the returned value (which could be anything at runtime) conforms to <code>Integer</code>, so it inserts another <code>checkcast</code> instruction.</p>\n<p>However, even when using a class that doesn't override Object's <code>toString</code>, Java still inserts a <code>checkcast</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>Main.&lt;Main&gt;method(Main.class).toString();\n  45: ldc           #6   // class Main\n  47: invokestatic  #3   // Method method:(Ljava/lang/Class;)Ljava/lang/Object;\n  50: checkcast     #6   // class Main\n  53: invokevirtual #7   // Method java/lang/Object.toString:()Ljava/lang/String;\n  56: pop\n</code></pre>\n<p>Despite targeting a method that exists for all objects with essentially choosing the static receiver type to be <code>Object</code>, Java still inserts <code>checkcast</code>.</p>\n<p>When we cast the returned value to <code>Object</code> by ourselves, however, Java does not add any <code>checkcast</code> whatsoever and the call can go through.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Let's back off a little and think about what we've been doing. We're not looking at Java per se, we've been looking at bytecode.</p>\n<p>Java is defined by the Java Language Specification.
