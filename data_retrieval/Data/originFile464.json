Java and .Net have similar performance level due to the virtual machine, but JVM normally has better performance because of years and years optimization.\r\n\r\n - Library. Although this depends on your task, Java has much more open source or third party libraries available there. For server App, J2EE, Spring, Struts, etc. For GUI, although .Net provides Win32 layer API but this causes compatibility issues. Java has Swing, SWT, AWT, etc. It works in most cases.\r\n\r\n - Compatibility. This is the key issues that need to be considered when develop the cross-platform program. Two issue: first, platform compatibility. Java still wins since JDK is well maintained by single and original company Sun. Mono is not maintained by MS, so you have no guarantee yet for update compatibility. 2. Backward compatibility. Sun maintains a good reputation on their backward compatibility, although sometimes this seems too rigid and slows the pace.\r\n\r\n - Tools. Java has good cross-platform IDEs. Netbeans, Eclipse, etc. Most of them are free. VS Studio is good but only on Windows, and not cost a bit. Both of them provides good unit tests, debugs, profiles, etc.\r\n\r\nHence I&#39;d suggest that Java is a better choice.

Although this depends on your task, Java has much more open source or third party libraries available there.

Two issue: first, platform compatibility. Java still wins since JDK is well maintained by single and original company Sun. Mono is not maintained by MS, so you have no guarantee yet for update compatibility. 2. Backward compatibility.

The Mono C# compiler is completely up to date with MS. The Mono VB.NET compiler does lag the MS version. The other compilers are the same on both platforms (as are other .NET languages like Nemerle, Boo, and Phalanger (PHP) ).\r\n\r\nMono ships with a lot of the actual Microsoft written code including the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR), Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF), F#, and ASP.NET MVC. Because Razor is not Open Source, Mono currently ships with MVC2 but MVC3 works on Mono just fine.\r\n\r\nThe core Mono platform has kept pace with .NET or many years and the compatibility is impressive. You can use the full C# 4.0 language and even some C# 5.0 features today. In fact, Mono often leads .NET in many ways.\r\n\r\nMono implements parts of the CLR spec that even Microsoft does not support (like 64 bit arrays). One of the most exciting new pieces of technology in the .NET world is [Roslyn][5]. Mono has offered the C# compiler as a service for many years. Some of what Roslyn offers is available via [NRefactory][6] as well. An example of were Mono is still ahead would be the SIMD instructions to accelerate gaming performance.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft does offer a number of products on top of .NET that are not available in Mono which is were the misconception about Mono lagging comes from. Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Entity Framework (EF), WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) are examples of products which do not work, or are poorly supported, on Mono. The obvious solution is to use cross-platform alternatives like GTK#, NHibernate, and ServiceStack instead.\r\n\r\n**Issue: Microsoft is evil.**\r\n\r\n**Answer: True. So what.**\r\n\r\nMany people offer the following reasons to avoid using Mono:\r\n\r\n1) You should not use Mono because Microsoft tech should be avoided\r\n\r\n2) Mono sucks because it does not let you use every technology that Microsoft offers\r\n\r\nTo me, it is clear that these statements are incompatible. I reject the first statement but will skip that argument here. The second statement is true of all .NET alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe JVM is a great platform and the explosion of JVM languages is awesome.

Some of what Roslyn offers is available via <a href=\"https://github.com/icsharpcode/NRefactory\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">NRefactory</a> as well. An example of were Mono is still ahead would be the SIMD instructions to accelerate gaming performance.</p>\n<p>Microsoft does offer a number of products on top of .NET that are not available in Mono which is were the misconception about Mono lagging comes from. Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Entity Framework (EF), WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) are examples of products which do not work, or are poorly supported, on Mono. The obvious solution is to use cross-platform alternatives like GTK#, NHibernate, and ServiceStack instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Issue: Microsoft is evil.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Answer: True. So what.</strong></p>\n<p>Many people offer the following reasons to avoid using Mono:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>You should not use Mono because Microsoft tech should be avoided</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Mono sucks because it does not let you use every technology that Microsoft offers</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To me, it is clear that these statements are incompatible. I reject the first statement but will skip that argument here. The second statement is true of all .NET alternatives.</p>\n<p>The JVM is a great platform and the explosion of JVM languages is awesome. Use what makes you happy. For now, that is often .NET/Mono for me.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1552,"reputation":30929,"user_id":2077,"accept_rate":84,"display_name":"Hanno Fietz"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":4,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26471,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":8,"up_vote_count":118,"closed_date":1351886209,"accepted_answer_id":61565,"answer_count":15,"score":110,"last_activity_date":1683012004,"creation_date":1221418824,"question_id":61559,"body_markdown":"How much less libraries are there for Mono than for Java?\r\n\r\nI lack the overview over both alternatives but I have pretty much freedom of choice for my next project.

And so on.. there will be a whole chain of constructors called all the way back to the constructor of Object; &quot;All Classes in the Java platform are Descendants of Object&quot;. This thing is called &quot;**Constructor Chaining**&quot;.\r\n\r\n*&lt;b&gt;Now why is this?&lt;/b&gt;*&lt;br/&gt;\r\nAnd the reason why Java defined the ConstructorBody in this way, is that they needed to &lt;b&gt;maintain the hierarchy&lt;/b&gt; of the object. Remember the definition of the inheritance; It&#39;s extending a class. With that being said, you cannot extend something that doesn&#39;t exist. The base (the superclass) needs to be created first, then you can derive it (the subclass). That&#39;s why they called them Parent and Child classes; you can&#39;t have a child without a parent. \r\n\r\nOn a technical level, a subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, nested classes) from its parent. And since Constructors are NOT members (They don&#39;t belong to objects. They are responsible of creating objects) so they are NOT inherited by subclasses, but they can be invoked. And since **at the time of object creation only ONE constructor is executed**. So how do we guarantee the creation of the superclass when you create the subclass object? Thus the concept of &quot;constructor chaining&quot;; so we have the ability to invoke other constructors (i.e. super) from within the current constructor. And Java required this invocation to be the FIRST line in the subclass constructor to maintain the hierarchy and guarantee it. They assume that if you don&#39;t explicitly create the parent object FIRST (like if you forgot about it), they will do it implicitly for you. \r\n\r\nThis check is done during compilation. But I&#39;m not sure what would happen on runtime, what kind of runtime error we would get, IF Java doesn&#39;t throw a compile-error when we explicitly try to execute a base constructor from within a subclass&#39;s constructor in the middle of its body and not from the very first line ...

And according to the Java language specification,  this is how the constructor's body is defined:</p>\n\n<p><strong>ConstructorBody:\n        { ExplicitConstructorInvocation<sub>opt</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp; BlockStatements<sub>opt</sub> }</strong></p>\n\n<p>The first statement of a constructor body may be either</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>an explicit invocation of another constructor of the same class (by using the keyword \"this\"); or</li>\n<li>an explicit invocation of the direct superclass (by using the keyword \"super\")</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If a constructor body does not begin with an explicit constructor invocation and the constructor being declared is not part of the primordial class Object, then the constructor body implicitly begins with a superclass constructor invocation \"super();\", an invocation of the constructor of its direct superclass that takes no arguments. And so on.. there will be a whole chain of constructors called all the way back to the constructor of Object; \"All Classes in the Java platform are Descendants of Object\". This thing is called \"<strong>Constructor Chaining</strong>\".</p>\n\n<p><em><b>Now why is this?</b></em><br/>\nAnd the reason why Java defined the ConstructorBody in this way, is that they needed to <b>maintain the hierarchy</b> of the object. Remember the definition of the inheritance; It's extending a class. With that being said, you cannot extend something that doesn't exist. The base (the superclass) needs to be created first, then you can derive it (the subclass). That's why they called them Parent and Child classes; you can't have a child without a parent. </p>\n\n<p>On a technical level, a subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, nested classes) from its parent. And since Constructors are NOT members (They don't belong to objects. They are responsible of creating objects) so they are NOT inherited by subclasses, but they can be invoked. And since <strong>at the time of object creation only ONE constructor is executed</strong>. So how do we guarantee the creation of the superclass when you create the subclass object? Thus the concept of \"constructor chaining\"; so we have the ability to invoke other constructors (i.e. super) from within the current constructor. And Java required this invocation to be the FIRST line in the subclass constructor to maintain the hierarchy and guarantee it. They assume that if you don't explicitly create the parent object FIRST (like if you forgot about it), they will do it implicitly for you. </p>\n\n<p>This check is done during compilation. But I'm not sure what would happen on runtime, what kind of runtime error we would get, IF Java doesn't throw a compile-error when we explicitly try to execute a base constructor from within a subclass's constructor in the middle of its body and not from the very first line ... </p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":46836,"reputation":12142,"user_id":138513,"accept_rate":46,"display_name":"Hakanai"},"score":0,"creation_date":1402278691,"post_id":23204035,"comment_id":37198310,"body_markdown":"Writing a sane grammar for the feature would in itself be quite hard - such a grammar would match a statement tree where at most one leaf node is an explicit super-constructor call.

However, a constructor of a subclass has got the ability to ignore an exception occurred in one of its superclasses and to return a partially initialized object. In the above example, if the argument given to `new Bad()` is either 0 or greater than 100, then neither `essential1` nor `essential2` are properly initialized.\r\n\r\nYou may say that ignoring exceptions is always a bad idea. OK, here&#39;s another example:\r\n\r\n    class Bad extends Good {\r\n        Bad(int n) {\r\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)\r\n                super(i);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFunny, isn&#39;t it? How many objects are we creating in this example? One? Two? Or maybe nothing...\r\n\r\nAllowing to call `super()` or `this()` in the middle of a constructor would open a Pandora&#39;s box of heinous constructors.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I understand a frequent need to include some static part before a call to `super()` or `this()`. This might be any code not relying on `this` reference (which, in fact, already exists at the very beginning of a constructor, but cannot be used orderly until `super()` or `this()` returns) and needed to make such call. In addition, like in any method, there&#39;s a chance that some local variables created before the call to `super()` or `this()` will be needed after it. \r\n\r\nIn such cases, you have the following opportunities:\r\n\r\n 1. Use the pattern presented at [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51571736/9772691), which allows to circumvent the restriction.\r\n 2. Wait for the Java team to allow pre-`super()` and pre-`this()` code. It may be done by imposing a restriction on where `super()` or `this()` may occur in a constructor. Actually, even today&#39;s compiler is able to distinguish good and bad (or potentially bad) cases with the degree enough to securely allow static code addition at the beginning of a constructor. Indeed, assume that `super()` and `this()` return `this` reference and, in turn, your constructor has\r\n\r\n&lt;e&gt;\r\n\r\n    return this;\r\n\r\nat the end. As well as the compiler rejects the code\r\n\r\n\r\n    public int get() {\r\n        int x;\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)\r\n            x = i;\r\n        return x;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public int get(int y) {\r\n        int x;\r\n        if (y &gt; 0)\r\n            x = y;\r\n        return x;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public int get(boolean b) {\r\n        int x;\r\n        try {\r\n            x = 1;\r\n        } catch (Exception e) {\r\n        }\r\n        return x;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the error &quot;variable x might not have been initialized&quot;, it could do so on `this` variable, making its checks on it just like on any other local variable. The only difference is `this` cannot be assigned by any means other than `super()` or `this()` call (and, as usual, if there is no such call at a constructor, `super()` is implicitly inserted by compiler in the beginning) and might not be assigned twice. In case of any doubt (like in the first `get()`, where `x` is actually always assigned), the compiler could return an error. That would be better than simply return error on any constructor where there is something except a comment before `super()` or `this()`.","title":"Why do this() and super() have to be the first statement in a constructor?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Can you give a code example where, if the compiler did not have this restriction, something bad would happen?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>class Good {\n    int essential1;\n    int essential2;\n\n    Good(int n) {\n        if (n &gt; 100)\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"n is too large!\");\n        essential1 = 1 / n;\n        essential2 = n + 2;\n    }\n}\n\nclass Bad extends Good {\n    Bad(int n) {\n        try {\n            super(n);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            // Exception is ignored\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Bad b = new Bad(0);\n//        b = new Bad(101);\n        System.out.println(b.essential1 + b.essential2);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>An exception during construction almost always indicates that the object being constructed could not be properly initialized, now is in a bad state, unusable, and must be garbage collected. However, a constructor of a subclass has got the ability to ignore an exception occurred in one of its superclasses and to return a partially initialized object. In the above example, if the argument given to <code>new Bad()</code> is either 0 or greater than 100, then neither <code>essential1</code> nor <code>essential2</code> are properly initialized.</p>\n\n<p>You may say that ignoring exceptions is always a bad idea. OK, here's another example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Bad extends Good {\n    Bad(int n) {\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)\n            super(i);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Funny, isn't it?

In addition, like in any method, there's a chance that some local variables created before the call to <code>super()</code> or <code>this()</code> will be needed after it. </p>\n\n<p>In such cases, you have the following opportunities:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Use the pattern presented at <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/51571736/9772691\">this answer</a>, which allows to circumvent the restriction.</li>\n<li>Wait for the Java team to allow pre-<code>super()</code> and pre-<code>this()</code> code.

As in your code sample, you can even read an entire file into a `byte []`. But, when a file is treated as an array of `byte`, it&#39;s up to the programmer to provide code that assembles the individual byte into various fields, whether primitives or Objects. That can be cumbersome.\r\n\r\n* Treating a file as an array of `byte` isn&#39;t needed when the data is in a text file. Java offers several APIs that make it easier to process data in text files. [`FileInputStream`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/FileInputStream.html) is NOT one of them. But, [`BufferedReader`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/BufferedReader.html) is.\r\n\r\n* Why do you have a variable `maze` in your code?  Along with the 2D array of `byte`, this makes it look like you took existing code,  perhaps for a maze, and inappropriately attempted to adapt it to an unrelated problem. \r\n\r\n* If you are going to treat the data as a 2D array, it should be an array of `String`. Each row in the array represents one row in the table / source data.  Each element in a row represents one element. Think about it: You can&#39;t hold all 10 characters of a tariff code in one byte. If you use an array of `byte`, it would have to be a *3D array*. And that would be worse. Again, you would have to provide code to build fields from &#39;bye []`. \r\n\r\n* In the second code sample, you found a way, using `BufferedReader` to read the file in as `String` for each line. But, the code following goes backward: It converts the result into a `char[]`.  What you want to do is parse `line` to extract the values of the fields it represents.\r\n\r\nJava has *a lot* of tools you can use. One is the `split` method of `String`:\r\n\r\n     while ((line = br.readLine() ) != null ){\r\n        String [] = line.split (&quot; &quot;); \r\n\r\n [`line.split(&quot; &quot;)`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#split(java.lang.String)) will be based on whitespace, as you wish. You could put the results into a 2D array you had in mind in the first place. But, you still have to parse to get numeric data so you can do the arithmetic. \r\n\r\nTo parse numeric data from a `String`, you can use methods that take `String` and return the type of value you want in these APIs:\r\n\r\n* [Integer](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Integer.html)\r\n* [Long](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Long.html)\r\n* [Float](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Float.html)\r\n* [Double](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Double.html)\r\n* [BigDecimal](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/math/BigDecimal.html)\r\n\r\nWhen updating the array, you would need to convert updated numeric values back to `String`. Example: `foo [i][1] = Integer.toString (totalQuantity);`\r\n\r\nIf the data is kept in a 2D `String` array, the code might work like this:\r\n\r\n* Read a line\r\n* Parse the numeric values\r\n* Search the array\r\n* If a match is found, do the following:\r\n* * Parse the numeric fields in the matching row\r\n* * Do the arithmetic \r\n* * Update the matching row.\r\n* If a match is not found, add the new data as a new row in the array.\r\n* Repeat as long as there are lines to be read.\r\n\r\nYou could reduce the amount of parsing by keeping separate arrays:\r\n\r\n     String [] name;\r\n     String [] tariffCode;\r\n     float [] weight;\r\n     int [] quanity;\r\n     BigDecimal [] price;\r\n\r\nNow, you have 5 tightly coupled arrays, also known as parallel arrays. That is regarded as poor design, especially in an Object-Oriented Programming language, such as Java. It is better to create a class, and use Objects. \r\n\r\nThe class:\r\n\r\n    import java.math.BigDecimal;\r\n    import java.util.Objects;\r\n    import java.util.Scanner;\r\n\r\n    public class Product {\r\n\r\n       private String name;\r\n       private int quantity;\r\n       private float weight;\r\n       private BigDecimal price;\r\n       private String tariffCode;\r\n       \r\n       public Product(String name, int qty, float wght, BigDecimal price,\r\n                String tariffCode) {\r\n           this.name = name;\r\n           this.quantity = qty;\r\n           this.weight = wght;\r\n           this.price = price;\r\n           this.tariffCode = tariffCode;\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       // generated by IDE\r\n       @Override\r\n       public int hashCode() {\r\n           int hash = 5;\r\n           hash = 47 * hash + Objects.hashCode(this.tariffCode);\r\n           return hash;\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       // generated by IDE\r\n       @Override\r\n       public boolean equals(Object obj) {\r\n           if (this == obj) {\r\n              return true;\r\n           }\r\n           if (obj == null) {\r\n               return false;\r\n           }\r\n           if (getClass() != obj.getClass()) {\r\n               return false;\r\n           }\r\n           final Product other = (Product) obj;\r\n           return Objects.equals(this.tariffCode, other.tariffCode);\r\n       }\r\n  \r\n       // this method allows a Product Object to represent \r\n       // inventory totals\r\n       public Product add (Product detail) {\r\n          this.quantity += detail.quantity;\r\n          this.weight += detail.weight;\r\n          this.price = price.add (detail.price);\r\n          return this;\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can add the getters and setters you need. I omitted the default constructor, i.e., `public Product ()`. It would be a good idea to add it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote the `class` has a method `public boolean equals (Object obj)`. That will be needed for searches. Code like `if (inventory [i].tariffCode == target.tariffCode)` won&#39;t work. See [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/513832/how-do-i-compare-strings-in-java) . \r\n\r\nIt also has a `public int hashCode ()` method. `hashCode` should *always* be overridden when `equals` is. In fact, it will be needed for a version of this answer. \r\n\r\nThis `class` allows use of one array instead of 5:\r\n\r\n     Product [] inventory; \r\n\r\nWhen you instantiate arrays, you want to know how many lines there will be in the file you are reading. How do you know that, unless you already read the file? \r\n\r\nOne way to avoid reading the file twice is to set some maximum value. \r\n\r\nHere is what we have so far, using the `Product` class above:\r\n\r\n    public static void productSum1(String fileName) {\r\n        try {\r\n            FileReader dataFile = new FileReader(fileName);\r\n            BufferedReader dataSource = new BufferedReader(dataFile);\r\n             \r\n            final int MAX_SIZE =  30_000;\r\n            Product [] inventory = new Product [MAX_SIZE];\r\n            int actualSize = 0;\r\n            String line;\r\n            String [] lineData; \r\n            Product lineItem;\r\n            while ((line = dataSource.readLine() ) != null ) {\r\n                lineData = line.split(&quot; &quot;);\r\n                lineItem = new Product (  lineData [0]\r\n                                        , Integer.parseInt(lineData[1])\r\n                                        , Float.parseFloat(lineData[2])\r\n                                        , new BigDecimal (lineData[3])\r\n                                        , lineData [4]\r\n                );\r\n                \r\n                actualSize = update (inventory, actualSize, lineItem);\r\n            }\r\n        } \r\n         // catch blocks \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public static int update (Product [] invent, int size, Product item) {\r\n        // code to search array and update\r\n        return size;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe code to search and update the array is left to you. \r\n \r\nIf the `update` method does not find a matching item in the inventory totals, it will add it to the array. This makes it necessary to update `actualSize`. \r\n\r\n**Note:** Java is pass by value. Updating the local variable `size` in the `update` method will *not* result in an update of `actualSize` in the calling method. For this reason, `update` returns `size`.\r\n\r\nOne of the comments noted the code sample has `import java.util.Scanner;` but the code didn&#39;t use a `Scanner`. [`Scanner`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Scanner.html) is a popular tool for extracting data from text sources. You could use a `Scanner` to wrap the file, and let `Scanner` methods parse the data for you.  \r\n\r\nYou could have a constructor in the `Product` class like this:\r\n\r\n    public Product (Scanner dataSource) {\r\n        this.name = dataSource.next();\r\n        this.quantity = dataSource.nextInt ();\r\n        this.weight = dataSource.nextFloat();\r\n        this.price = dataSource.nextBigDecimal();\r\n        this.tariffCode = dataSource.next ();\r\n    } \r\n\r\nThe code that reads the file \r\n\r\n    public static void productSum1(String fileName) {\r\n        try {\r\n            FileReader dataFile = new FileReader(fileName);\r\n            Scanner dataSource = new Scanner (dataFile);\r\n             \r\n            final int MAX_SIZE =  30_000;\r\n            Product [] inventory = new Product [MAX_SIZE];\r\n            int actualSize = 0;\r\n            Product lineItem;\r\n            while (dataSource.hasNext()) {\r\n                lineItem = new Product (dataSource );                \r\n                actualSize = update (inventory, actualSize, lineItem);\r\n            }\r\n            // rest of code omitted \r\n\r\nInstead of an array, consider using a [`Collection`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collection.html). Like an array, a `Collection` can hold a number of related elements. But, a `Collection` is more flexible than an array.  A popular type of `Collection` is an [`ArrayList`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html). Note that an `ArrayList` and other `Collection` Objects can change their own size. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother popular `Collection` is a [`HashMap`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashMap.html). When an search by key for a specific element is done on a `HashMap`, it is almost always done in O(1) time. \r\n\r\nAdd this method to `class Product`: \r\n\r\n        public String getKey () { return tariffCode; }\r\n\r\nThe code to update the inventory:\r\n\r\n    public static void productSum2(String fileName) {\r\n        try {\r\n            FileReader dataFile = new FileReader(fileName);\r\n            Scanner dataSource = new Scanner(dataFile);\r\n\r\n            Map&lt;String, Product&gt; inventory = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n            Product lineItem;\r\n            while (dataSource.hasNext()) {\r\n                lineItem = new Product(dataSource);\r\n                update(inventory, lineItem);\r\n            }\r\n        } // insert catch blocks here\r\n    }\r\n\r\n       \r\n    public static void update (Map&lt;String, Product&gt; inventory, Product item) {\r\n        Product total = inventory.get (item.getKey());\r\n        if (total == null) {\r\n            inventory.put (item.getKey(), item);\r\n        } else { \r\n            inventory.put (total.getKey (), total.add(item));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou might not be familiar with `HashMap`, so I did include the code for the `update` method.\r\n\r\nNote that `HashMap` relies on a proper implementation of `.equals` and `.hashCode` in the Objects it stores and retrieves. \r\n\r\nI omitted code to output the results to either a file or a console. If you used the `HashMap`, you might find the `.values()` method useful. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n------ \r\n* I did not attempt to run the code samples in this answer. \r\n* This is not robust. It cannot handle errors in the input file. \r\n* If you find errors in this answer, you may leave a comment or edit this answer.\r\n","title":"Java Initializing 2d array from the file, counting data and providing the result to file","body":"<p>Your code samples show a lot of confusion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>You are correct that, in Java, a file can be accessed in a manner similar to an array of <code>byte</code>.

But, <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/BufferedReader.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>BufferedReader</code></a> is.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Why do you have a variable <code>maze</code> in your code?  Along with the 2D array of <code>byte</code>, this makes it look like you took existing code,  perhaps for a maze, and inappropriately attempted to adapt it to an unrelated problem.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you are going to treat the data as a 2D array, it should be an array of <code>String</code>. Each row in the array represents one row in the table / source data.  Each element in a row represents one element. Think about it: You can't hold all 10 characters of a tariff code in one byte. If you use an array of <code>byte</code>, it would have to be a <em>3D array</em>. And that would be worse. Again, you would have to provide code to build fields from 'bye []`.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In the second code sample, you found a way, using <code>BufferedReader</code> to read the file in as <code>String</code> for each line. But, the code following goes backward: It converts the result into a <code>char[]</code>.  What you want to do is parse <code>line</code> to extract the values of the fields it represents.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Java has <em>a lot</em> of tools you can use. One is the <code>split</code> method of <code>String</code>:</p>\n<pre><code> while ((line = br.readLine() ) != null ){\n    String [] = line.split (&quot; &quot;); \n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#split(java.lang.String)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>line.split(&quot; &quot;)</code></a> will be based on whitespace, as you wish. You could put the results into a 2D array you had in mind in the first place. But, you still have to parse to get numeric data so you can do the arithmetic.</p>\n<p>To parse numeric data from a <code>String</code>, you can use methods that take <code>String</code> and return the type of value you want in these APIs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Integer.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Integer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Long.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Long</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Float.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Float</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Double.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Double</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/math/BigDecimal.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BigDecimal</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>When updating the array, you would need to convert updated numeric values back to <code>String</code>. Example: <code>foo [i][1] = Integer.toString (totalQuantity);</code></p>\n<p>If the data is kept in a 2D <code>String</code> array, the code might work like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read a line</li>\n<li>Parse the numeric values</li>\n<li>Search the array</li>\n<li>If a match is found, do the following:</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Parse the numeric fields in the matching row</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Do the arithmetic</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Update the matching row.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If a match is not found, add the new data as a new row in the array.</li>\n<li>Repeat as long as there are lines to be read.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You could reduce the amount of parsing by keeping separate arrays:</p>\n<pre><code> String [] name;\n String [] tariffCode;\n float [] weight;\n int [] quanity;\n BigDecimal [] price;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, you have 5 tightly coupled arrays, also known as parallel arrays. That is regarded as poor design, especially in an Object-Oriented Programming language, such as Java. It is better to create a class, and use Objects.</p>\n<p>The class:</p>\n<pre><code>import java.math.BigDecimal;\nimport java.util.Objects;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Product {\n\n   private String name;\n   private int quantity;\n   private float weight;\n   private BigDecimal price;\n   private String tariffCode;\n   \n   public Product(String name, int qty, float wght, BigDecimal price,\n            String tariffCode) {\n       this.name = name;\n       this.quantity = qty;\n       this.weight = wght;\n       this.price = price;\n       this.tariffCode = tariffCode;\n   }\n\n   // generated by IDE\n   @Override\n   public int hashCode() {\n       int hash = 5;\n       hash = 47 * hash + Objects.hashCode(this.tariffCode);\n       return hash;\n   }\n\n   // generated by IDE\n   @Override\n   public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n       if (this == obj) {\n          return true;\n       }\n       if (obj == null) {\n           return false;\n       }\n       if (getClass() != obj.getClass()) {\n           return false;\n       }\n       final Product other = (Product) obj;\n       return Objects.equals(this.tariffCode, other.tariffCode);\n   }\n\n   // this method allows a Product Object to represent \n   // inventory totals\n   public Product add (Product detail) {\n      this.quantity += detail.quantity;\n      this.weight += detail.weight;\n      this.price = price.add (detail.price);\n      return this;\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can add the getters and setters you need. I omitted the default constructor, i.e., <code>public Product ()</code>. It would be a good idea to add it.</p>\n<p>Note the <code>class</code> has a method <code>public boolean equals (Object obj)</code>. That will be needed for searches. Code like <code>if (inventory [i].tariffCode == target.tariffCode)</code> won't work. See <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/513832/how-do-i-compare-strings-in-java\">this question</a> .</p>\n<p>It also has a <code>public int hashCode ()</code> method. <code>hashCode</code> should <em>always</em> be overridden when <code>equals</code> is. In fact, it will be needed for a version of this answer.</p>\n<p>This <code>class</code> allows use of one array instead of 5:</p>\n<pre><code> Product [] inventory; \n</code></pre>\n<p>When you instantiate arrays, you want to know how many lines there will be in the file you are reading. How do you know that, unless you already read the file?</p>\n<p>One way to avoid reading the file twice is to set some maximum value.</p>\n<p>Here is what we have so far, using the <code>Product</code> class above:</p>\n<pre><code>public static void productSum1(String fileName) {\n    try {\n        FileReader dataFile = new FileReader(fileName);\n        BufferedReader dataSource = new BufferedReader(dataFile);\n         \n        final int MAX_SIZE =  30_000;\n        Product [] inventory = new Product [MAX_SIZE];\n        int actualSize = 0;\n        String line;\n        String [] lineData; \n        Product lineItem;\n        while ((line = dataSource.readLine() ) != null ) {\n            lineData = line.split(&quot; &quot;);\n            lineItem = new Product (  lineData [0]\n                                    , Integer.parseInt(lineData[1])\n                                    , Float.parseFloat(lineData[2])\n                                    , new BigDecimal (lineData[3])\n                                    , lineData [4]\n            );\n            \n            actualSize = update (inventory, actualSize, lineItem);\n        }\n    } \n     // catch blocks \n}\n\npublic static int update (Product [] invent, int size, Product item) {\n    // code to search array and update\n    return size;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The code to search and update the array is left to you.</p>\n<p>If the <code>update</code> method does not find a matching item in the inventory totals, it will add it to the array. This makes it necessary to update <code>actualSize</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Java is pass by value. Updating the local variable <code>size</code> in the <code>update</code> method will <em>not</em> result in an update of <code>actualSize</code> in the calling method. For this reason, <code>update</code> returns <code>size</code>.</p>\n<p>One of the comments noted the code sample has <code>import java.util.Scanner;</code> but the code didn't use a <code>Scanner</code>. <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Scanner.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Scanner</code></a> is a popular tool for extracting data from text sources. You could use a <code>Scanner</code> to wrap the file, and let <code>Scanner</code> methods parse the data for you.</p>\n<p>You could have a constructor in the <code>Product</code> class like this:</p>\n<pre><code>public Product (Scanner dataSource) {\n    this.name = dataSource.next();\n    this.quantity = dataSource.nextInt ();\n    this.weight = dataSource.nextFloat();\n    this.price = dataSource.nextBigDecimal();\n    this.tariffCode = dataSource.next ();\n} \n</code></pre>\n<p>The code that reads the file</p>\n<pre><code>public static void productSum1(String fileName) {\n    try {\n        FileReader dataFile = new FileReader(fileName);\n        Scanner dataSource = new Scanner (dataFile);\n         \n        final int MAX_SIZE =  30_000;\n        Product [] inventory = new Product [MAX_SIZE];\n        int actualSize = 0;\n        Product lineItem;\n        while (dataSource.hasNext()) {\n            lineItem = new Product (dataSource );                \n            actualSize = update (inventory, actualSize, lineItem);\n        }\n        // rest of code omitted \n</code></pre>\n<p>Instead of an array, consider using a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collection.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Collection</code></a>. Like an array, a <code>Collection</code> can hold a number of related elements. But, a <code>Collection</code> is more flexible than an array.  A popular type of <code>Collection</code> is an <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>ArrayList</code></a>. Note that an <code>ArrayList</code> and other <code>Collection</code> Objects can change their own size.</p>\n<p>Another popular <code>Collection</code> is a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashMap.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>HashMap</code></a>. When an search by key for a specific element is done on a <code>HashMap</code>, it is almost always done in O(1) time.</p>\n<p>Add this method to <code>class Product</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>    public String getKey () { return tariffCode; }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The code to update the inventory:</p>\n<pre><code>public static void productSum2(String fileName) {\n    try {\n        FileReader dataFile = new FileReader(fileName);\n        Scanner dataSource = new Scanner(dataFile);\n\n        Map&lt;String, Product&gt; inventory = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n        Product lineItem;\n        while (dataSource.hasNext()) {\n            lineItem = new Product(dataSource);\n            update(inventory, lineItem);\n        }\n    } // insert catch blocks here\n}\n\n   \npublic static void update (Map&lt;String, Product&gt; inventory, Product item) {\n    Product total = inventory.get (item.getKey());\n    if (total == null) {\n        inventory.put (item.getKey(), item);\n    } else { \n        inventory.put (total.getKey (), total.add(item));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You might not be familiar with <code>HashMap</code>, so I did include the code for the <code>update</code> method.</p>\n<p>Note that <code>HashMap</code> relies on a proper implementation of <code>.equals</code> and <code>.hashCode</code> in the Objects it stores and retrieves.</p>\n<p>I omitted code to output the results to either a file or a console. If you used the <code>HashMap</code>, you might find the <code>.values()</code> method useful.</p>\n<h2>Notes:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I did not attempt to run the code samples in this answer.</li>\n<li>This is not robust.

The same thing happens if I use <code>Thread.sleep(0, period / 4);</code>.\nI understand the <code>Thread.sleep</code> and <code>LockSupport.parkNanos</code> can only guarantee the minimum time to sleep/halt.\nIs there a way to achieve what I want, i.e: tick the lock at this frequency without making the thread to run constantly?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","intellij-idea","gradle"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2256418,"reputation":3983,"user_id":1987514,"accept_rate":86,"display_name":"Ben Green"},"score":0,"creation_date":1494487834,"post_id":43908454,"comment_id":74851521,"body_markdown":"Do you get an error when running `compileJava` task on the command line?
