Thus, even if multiple classes in one source file works on your development platform, it is bad practice to do this.</p>\n<p>My understanding is that this &quot;permission to reject&quot; is a design decision that is intended <em>in part</em> to make it easier to implement Java on a wider range of platforms.  If (conversely) the JLS required all compilers to support source files containing multiple classes, there would be conceptual issues implementing Java on a platform which wasn't file-system based.</p>\n<p>In practice, seasoned Java developers don't miss being able to do this at all.  Modularization and information hiding are better done using an appropriate combination of packages, class access modifiers and inner or nested classes.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"display_name":"anon"},"score":3,"creation_date":1251041607,"post_id":1318752,"comment_id":1151895,"body_markdown":"Does anyone have experience of using Java on platforms that don&#39;t have tree-structured directores?

I think that indeed in C# or Java one is more tempted to implement a shallow copy, but I suspect that is because implementing a deep copy is more bothersome, and in most cases the shallow copy will be accidentally sufficient."}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":15628,"reputation":244161,"user_id":33213,"accept_rate":76,"display_name":"jalf"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1280322081,"creation_date":1280322081,"answer_id":3353058,"question_id":3351018,"body_markdown":"&gt; Remark: I don&#39;t care in which language the examples are given.

Also, the key and the value of each entry is immutable, cannot be changed. [See the Javadoc][2] for other rules, such as no NULLs allowed, no duplicate keys allowed, and the iteration order of mappings is arbitrary.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s look at these methods, using some sample data for a map of day-of-week to a person who we expect will work on that day.\r\n\r\n    Person alice = new Person( &quot;Alice&quot; );\r\n    Person bob = new Person( &quot;Bob&quot; );\r\n    Person carol = new Person( &quot;Carol&quot; );\r\n\r\n## `Map.of()`\r\n\r\n[`Map.of`][1] creates an empty `Map`. Unmodifiable, so you cannot add entries. Here is an example of such a map, empty with no entries.\r\n\r\n    Map &lt; DayOfWeek, Person &gt; dailyWorkerEmpty = Map.of();\r\n\r\n&gt;dailyWorkerEmpty.toString(): {}\r\n\r\n## `Map.of( … )`\r\n\r\n`Map.of( k , v , k , v , …)` are several methods that take 1 to 10 key-value pairs. Here is an example of two entries.\r\n\r\n    Map &lt; DayOfWeek, Person &gt; weekendWorker = \r\n            Map.of( \r\n                DayOfWeek.SATURDAY , alice ,     // key , value\r\n                DayOfWeek.SUNDAY , bob           // key , value\r\n            )\r\n    ;\r\n\r\n&gt;weekendWorker.toString(): {SUNDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Bob&#39; }, SATURDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Alice&#39; }}\r\n\r\n## `Map.ofEntries( … )`\r\n\r\n[`Map.ofEntries( Map.Entry , … )`][3] takes any number of objects implementing the [`Map.Entry`][4] interface. Java bundles two classes implementing that interface, one mutable, the other immutable:     [`AbstractMap.SimpleEntry`][5], [`AbstractMap.SimpleImmutableEntry`][6]. But we need not specify a concrete class. We merely need to call [`Map.entry( k , v )`][7] method, pass our key and our value, and we get back an object of a some class implementing [`Map.Entry`][4] interface.\r\n\r\n    Map &lt; DayOfWeek, Person &gt; weekdayWorker = Map.ofEntries(\r\n            Map.entry( DayOfWeek.MONDAY , alice ) ,            // Call to `Map.entry` method returns an object implementing `Map.Entry`. \r\n            Map.entry( DayOfWeek.TUESDAY , bob ) ,\r\n            Map.entry( DayOfWeek.WEDNESDAY , bob ) ,\r\n            Map.entry( DayOfWeek.THURSDAY , carol ) ,\r\n            Map.entry( DayOfWeek.FRIDAY , carol )\r\n    );\r\n\r\n&gt;weekdayWorker.toString(): {WEDNESDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Bob&#39; }, TUESDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Bob&#39; }, THURSDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Carol&#39; }, FRIDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Carol&#39; }, MONDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Alice&#39; }}\r\n\r\n## `Map.copyOf`\r\n\r\n\r\nJava 10 added the method [`Map.copyOf`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html#copyOf(java.util.Map)). Pass an existing map, get back an immutable copy of that map.  \r\n\r\nFor efficiency, if the passed map is already truly immutable, the `copyOf` method returns a reference to the original without manufacturing a new map.\r\n\r\n## About `Collections.unmodifiableMap`\r\n\r\nTip: Prefer `Map.copyOf` over [`Collections.unmodifiableMap`][8] if you need/expect a truly immutable map. \r\n\r\nThe `Collections` method produces a *view* onto the original map, a mere wrapper, not a true copy. The upside: Being a mere view has the benefit of conserving memory. The downside: Modifications to the original show through.\r\n\r\nIf the original map gets modified (`put`, `remove`, etc.), the supposedly-unmodifiable will actually show the modification. In contrast, the `Map.copyOf` does indeed produce a true copy of the passed map if not already truly immutable.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nrecord Person( String name ) { }\r\nPerson alice = new Person ( &quot;Alice&quot; );\r\nPerson bob = new Person ( &quot;Bob&quot; );\r\nMap &lt; DayOfWeek, Person &gt; weekendWorkerMutable = HashMap.newHashMap ( 2 );\r\nweekendWorkerMutable.put ( DayOfWeek.SATURDAY , bob );\r\nweekendWorkerMutable.put ( DayOfWeek.SUNDAY , bob );\r\nSystem.out.println ( &quot;weekendWorkerMutable = &quot; + weekendWorkerMutable );\r\n\r\nMap &lt; DayOfWeek, Person &gt; weekendWorkerSupposedlyUnmodifiable = Collections.unmodifiableMap ( weekendWorkerMutable );\r\nSystem.out.println ( &quot;weekendWorkerSupposedlyUnmodifiable = &quot; + weekendWorkerSupposedlyUnmodifiable );\r\nMap &lt; DayOfWeek, Person &gt; trueCopy = Map.copyOf ( weekendWorkerSupposedlyUnmodifiable );\r\nSystem.out.println ( &quot;trueCopy = &quot; + trueCopy );\r\n\r\nweekendWorkerMutable.put ( DayOfWeek.SATURDAY , alice );  // &lt;--- Modify the original.\r\n\r\nSystem.out.println ( &quot; ----- After mutating the original mutable map  ----- &quot; );\r\nSystem.out.println ( &quot;weekendWorkerSupposedlyUnmodifiable = &quot; + weekendWorkerSupposedlyUnmodifiable );\r\nSystem.out.println ( &quot;trueCopy = &quot; + trueCopy );\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen run:\r\n\r\n - We see that the supposedly unmodifiable is indeed modifiable *indirectly*, by modifying the original map on which the unmodifiable map is a view. \r\n - In contrast, the `copyOf` method produces a true copy, showing Bob as working the entire weekend even after assigning Alice.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nweekendWorkerMutable = {SATURDAY=Person[name=Bob], SUNDAY=Person[name=Bob]}\r\nweekendWorkerSupposedlyUnmodifiable = {SATURDAY=Person[name=Bob], SUNDAY=Person[name=Bob]}\r\ntrueCopy = {SUNDAY=Person[name=Bob], SATURDAY=Person[name=Bob]}\r\n ----- After mutating the original mutable map  ----- \r\nweekendWorkerSupposedlyUnmodifiable = {SATURDAY=Person[name=Alice], SUNDAY=Person[name=Bob]}\r\ntrueCopy = {SUNDAY=Person[name=Bob], SATURDAY=Person[name=Bob]}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nNotice that the iterator order of maps produced via `Map.of` are *not* guaranteed. The entries have an arbitrary order. Do not write code based on the order seen, as the documentation warns the order is subject to change.\r\n\r\nNote that all of these `Map.of…` methods return a [`Map`][9] of **an unspecified class**. The underlying concrete class may even vary from one version of Java to another. This anonymity enables Java to choose from various implementations, whatever optimally fits your particular data.

Please help, thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","jakarta-ee","glassfish","payara"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":322981,"reputation":310755,"user_id":642706,"accept_rate":58,"display_name":"Basil Bourque"},"score":0,"creation_date":1692748967,"post_id":76956931,"comment_id":135666050,"body_markdown":"I would start by fixing the problem identified in your first line, the warning: *“might see unexpected results or exceptions”*","body":"I would start by fixing the problem identified in your first line, the warning: <i>“might see unexpected results or exceptions”</i>"},{"owner":{"account_id":411863,"reputation":7400,"user_id":784594,"display_name":"OndroMih"},"score":0,"creation_date":1694295920,"post_id":76956931,"comment_id":135873351,"body_markdown":"On which Java version you run Payara?

First, you need to understand how the platforms JavaFX, Mockito, and JUnit work. They are frameworks and unique in how they execute within the Java virtual machine. Any artifact that belongs to the domain of JavaFX will require JavaFX&#39;s runtime before they work the way you intend them to. This is why the main class (the class where the main method is contained) must subclass JavaFX&#39;s Application class and override its &quot;start&quot; method. When your application runs java knows to look for this method and your application runs within the domain of JavaFX, allowing all JavaFX&#39;s artifacts to execute as implemented in your code. In other words, a thread specific to JavaFX will be started and this is where your application will be executed, away from the main thread.\r\nSecond, when you run your tests with Junit you are not required to create a main class and its main method. Junit&#39;s framework does this for you behind the scenes and executes your tests. Junit is not aware of JavaFX so your tests should fail, and throw IllegalStateException because the JavaFX thread hasn&#39;t been started. Junit does not do that automatically. JavaFX&#39;s main thread needs to be started and all JavaFX code needs to run on that thread.\r\nIn my situation, I needed to test some business logic in my JavaFX application and these are the parts of the application that don&#39;t require JavaFX artifacts.  I had one of them like so\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n        public void onVendRequest(VendRequestVendronEvent event) {\r\n            // The paying amount entered by the customer on Vendron&#39;s sale UI is passed over to the application&#39;s GUI\r\n            CardPaymentController.setPayingAmount(event.getRequiredPrice());\r\n    \r\n            // Show the GUI (there&#39;s a lag of about two to three seconds)\r\n            Platform.runLater(() -&gt; super.stage.show());\r\n            this.socketPayLogger.info(&quot;Showing GUI&quot;);\r\n    \r\n            // More code below\r\n        }\r\nWell, you see the part that calls the GUI to be displayed, that&#39;s JavaFX code. This method runs on a separate thread because I employed concurrency in my application, and when I needed to call JavaFX code (like updating GUI components) from a thread that is not the main JavaFX thread I had to wrap my statements in a Runnable, hand it over to the &quot;runLater&quot; method and it safely executes them on the JavaFX&#39;s thread. Read about it [here][1]. Testing this method as said earlier will throw an IllegalStateException when JavaFx&#39;s thread is not running.

So, always remember that all JavaFx artifacts should be executed or called on the JavaFX&#39;s thread and not any other thread. Calling `Platform.startup(runnable);` will ensure JavaFX&#39;s main thread is started or make your main class the subclass of [Application][3] and if you must execute any JavaFX from a thread that&#39;s not the JavaFX thread use `Platform.runLater​(Runnable runnable)`\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://openjfx.io/javadoc/17/javafx.graphics/javafx/application/Platform.html#runLater(java.lang.Runnable)\r\n  [2]: https://openjfx.io/javadoc/17/javafx.graphics/javafx/application/Platform.html#startup(java.lang.Runnable)\r\n  [3]: https://openjfx.io/javadoc/17/javafx.graphics/javafx/application/Application.html","title":"How to mock JavaFX controls with mockito?","body":"<p>I hope my answer helps after it's been a long time since you asked this question but it can help someone out there.\nIt would have helped if you shared the output from your tests, error or not, but I was in your shoes a while ago. First, you need to understand how the platforms JavaFX, Mockito, and JUnit work. They are frameworks and unique in how they execute within the Java virtual machine. Any artifact that belongs to the domain of JavaFX will require JavaFX's runtime before they work the way you intend them to. This is why the main class (the class where the main method is contained) must subclass JavaFX's Application class and override its &quot;start&quot; method. When your application runs java knows to look for this method and your application runs within the domain of JavaFX, allowing all JavaFX's artifacts to execute as implemented in your code. In other words, a thread specific to JavaFX will be started and this is where your application will be executed, away from the main thread.\nSecond, when you run your tests with Junit you are not required to create a main class and its main method. Junit's framework does this for you behind the scenes and executes your tests. Junit is not aware of JavaFX so your tests should fail, and throw IllegalStateException because the JavaFX thread hasn't been started. Junit does not do that automatically. JavaFX's main thread needs to be started and all JavaFX code needs to run on that thread.\nIn my situation, I needed to test some business logic in my JavaFX application and these are the parts of the application that don't require JavaFX artifacts.  I had one of them like so</p>\n<pre><code>@Override\n    public void onVendRequest(VendRequestVendronEvent event) {\n        // The paying amount entered by the customer on Vendron's sale UI is passed over to the application's GUI\n        CardPaymentController.setPayingAmount(event.getRequiredPrice());\n\n        // Show the GUI (there's a lag of about two to three seconds)\n        Platform.runLater(() -&gt; super.stage.show());\n        this.socketPayLogger.info(&quot;Showing GUI&quot;);\n\n        // More code below\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Well, you see the part that calls the GUI to be displayed, that's JavaFX code. This method runs on a separate thread because I employed concurrency in my application, and when I needed to call JavaFX code (like updating GUI components) from a thread that is not the main JavaFX thread I had to wrap my statements in a Runnable, hand it over to the &quot;runLater&quot; method and it safely executes them on the JavaFX's thread. Read about it <a href=\"https://openjfx.io/javadoc/17/javafx.graphics/javafx/application/Platform.html#runLater(java.lang.Runnable)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. Testing this method as said earlier will throw an IllegalStateException when JavaFx's thread is not running. So to bring JavaFX framework into my test I had to add the line below in my tests.</p>\n<pre><code>Platform.startup(runnable);\n</code></pre>\n<p>You just have to simply place your tests in the runnable object and call that line in your test method.

This has not solved the issue.

Blocking is exactly what it says, it will block a thread and block that threads execution until it can move on, this is bad in a reactive world.\r\n\r\nYou should also not call `subscribe` in your application **unless your application is the final consumer of the response**. For instance, if you are calling an api to get data and write into a database that your application is connected to. Your backend application is the final consumer.

If you don't care about duplicates you could slightly modify your solution to use HashSet to achieve this goal in the following way:</p>\n<pre><code>// If duplicates are irrelevant\nprivate static String getDifference(List&lt;String&gt; ordered, List&lt;String&gt; sent) {\n    Set&lt;String&gt; orderedSet = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(ordered);\n    Set&lt;String&gt; sentSet = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(sent);\n    if (orderedSet.equals(sentSet)) {\n        return &quot;No difference&quot;;\n    } else {\n        StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();\n        orderedSet.removeAll(sent);\n\n        if (!orderedSet.isEmpty()) {\n            output.append(orderedSet.size()).append(&quot; item(s) missing in sent: &quot;);\n            output.append(&quot;\\&quot;&quot;).append(String.join(&quot;\\&quot;, \\&quot;&quot;, orderedSet)).append(&quot;\\&quot;&quot;);\n        }\n\n        sentSet.removeAll(ordered);\n\n        if (!sentSet.isEmpty()) {\n            if (output.length() &gt; 0) {\n                output.append(&quot; &amp; &quot;);\n            }\n\n            output.append(sentSet.size()).append(&quot; item(s) missing in ordered: &quot;);\n            output.append(&quot;\\&quot;&quot;).append(String.join(&quot;\\&quot;, \\&quot;&quot;, sentSet)).append(&quot;\\&quot;&quot;);\n        }\n\n        return output.toString();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you care about duplicates then you aren't actually comparing Lists but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Multisets</a>. For a Multiset implementation you could use the <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Guava</a> library. A possible implementation with Multisets looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>// If duplicates are relevant, with Guava\nprivate static String getDifferenceWithDuplicates(List&lt;String&gt; ordered, List&lt;String&gt; sent) {\n    Multiset&lt;String&gt; orderedSet = HashMultiset.&lt;String&gt;create(ordered);\n    Multiset&lt;String&gt; sentSet = HashMultiset.&lt;String&gt;create(sent);\n    if (orderedSet.equals(sentSet)) {\n        return &quot;No difference&quot;;\n    } else {\n        StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();\n\n        for (String item : Sets.union(orderedSet.elementSet(), sentSet.elementSet())) {\n            int orderedCount = orderedSet.count(item);\n            int sentCount = sentSet.count(item);\n\n            if (orderedCount != sentCount) {\n                if (output.length() &gt; 0) {\n                    output.append(&quot; &amp; &quot;);\n                }\n\n                output.append(Math.abs(orderedCount - sentCount)).append(&quot; item(s) missing in &quot;);\n                output.append(orderedCount &gt; sentCount ? &quot;sent&quot; : &quot;ordered&quot;).append(&quot;: &quot;);\n                output.append(&quot;\\&quot;&quot;).append(item).append(&quot;\\&quot;&quot;);\n            }\n        }\n        return output.toString();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If for some reason you can't use Guava, then you can implement the same behavior of a HashMultiset using a HashMap of type Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; where the key is the item and the value is the amount of appearances in the original list (this is an exercise for the reader).</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":14010051,"reputation":1143,"user_id":10118965,"display_name":"davidalayachew"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1692113705,"creation_date":1692075723,"answer_id":76903540,"question_id":76870864,"body_markdown":"Your solution is pretty good, but there&#39;s a little room for improvement.\r\n\r\nFirst off, you used `.equals()`.

Semantics of final Fields](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.5.1).  \r\nLet&#39;s apply these rules to our example (notice the names of the actions given in the comments).\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class MyClass {\r\n\r\n  final List&lt;String&gt; myList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n  MyClass() {\r\n    myList.add(&quot;foo&quot;); // w (internal write, e.g. myList.size=1)\r\n    // f (freeze action which happens at the end of constructor)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  void add(String data) {\r\n    myList.add(data); // r1 (read of final field &#39;o.myList&#39;) and r2 (internal read, e.g. myList.size))\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  static MyClass o;\r\n\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {\r\n    var thread1 = new Thread(() -&gt; {\r\n      o = new MyClass(); // a (publication of the object in thread1)\r\n    });\r\n    var thread2 = new Thread(() -&gt; {\r\n      o.add(&quot;test&quot;); // r0 (read of the published object in thread2)\r\n    });\r\n    thread1.start();\r\n    thread2.start();\r\n    thread1.join();\r\n    thread2.join();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this action names we can use the following rule from the JLS:\r\n&gt; Given a write _w_, a freeze _f_, an action _a_ (that is not a read of a `final` field), a read _r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;_ of the final field frozen by _f_, and a read _r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;_ such that _hb(w, f)_, _hb(f, a)_, _mc(a, r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)_, and _dereferences(r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)_, then when determining which values can be seen by _r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;_, we consider _hb(w, r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)_. (This _happens-before_ ordering does not transitively close with other _happens-before_ orderings.)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, _w_ (the write `o.myList.size=1` inside `MyClass()` in thread1) _happens-before*_ _r2_ (the read of `o.myList.size` in thread2).  \r\nAs a result, the JMM guarantees that thread2 sees inner state of `o.myList` as it was at the end of the constructor in thread1.\r\n\r\nYou can apply the same logic to any other inner field (at any depth) of the `o.myList` object.\r\n\r\nFor more info about the JMM `final` guarantees I would recommend [this presentation by Vladimir Sitnikov](https://www.slideshare.net/VladimirSitnikv/final-field-semantics).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nP.S. it&#39;s worth noting that _freeze_ happens at the end of the constructor that writes into the final field:\r\n&gt; Let _o_ be an object, and _c_ be a constructor for _o_ in which a `final` field _f_ is written. A _freeze_ action on `final` field _f_ of _o_ takes place when _c_ exits, either normally or abruptly.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Note that if one constructor invokes another constructor, and the invoked constructor sets a `final` field, the freeze for the `final` field takes place at the end of the invoked constructor. \r\n\r\nthis means in the following example thread2 may see `myList` as empty, because `freeze` happens at the end of `private MyClass() {}` constructor:\r\n```java\r\npublic class MyClass {\r\n\r\n  final List&lt;String&gt; myList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n  private MyClass() {}\r\n\r\n  // in thread1\r\n  MyClass(String str) {\r\n    this();\r\n    myList.add(str);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // in thread2\r\n  void add(String data) {\r\n    myList.add(data);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, those, who are curious about which of the object&#39;s constructors execute field initializers, should read [12.5.

It does not seem to be mentioned in the sections on functional interfaces or method references.\r\n\r\nHere is an example.\r\n\r\n    import java.util.function.BiFunction;\r\n    \r\n    public class TestBiFunction\r\n    {\r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            BiFunction&lt;A.B, Integer, Integer&gt; fx = A.B::dbl;\r\n            A.B b = new A.B();\r\n            int result = fx.apply(b, 3);\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Result = &quot; + result);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        private static class A {\r\n            private static class B {\r\n                public int dbl(int x) {\r\n                    return 2 * x;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo, specifically what I wondered was, in the statement &quot;BiFunction&lt;A.B, Integer&gt; fx = A.B::dbl;&quot;, what language rule makes the &quot;A.B&quot; in &quot;A.B::dbl&quot; become the first argument to the BiFunction?","title":"Question about implicit class argument in Java method reference","body":"<p>In Java, the class portion of a method reference can become the first argument of the function.

As you are seemingly very new at Spark, I&#39;d also suggest using Datasets not RDD."}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1017255,"reputation":1526,"user_id":1028537,"display_name":"Chris"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1691780311,"creation_date":1691780311,"answer_id":76886128,"question_id":76885428,"body_markdown":"Your original code was probably enough to hint at whats happening.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static void m1(int i){\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;===thread==&quot;+Thread.currentThread().getName()+&quot;===value==&quot;+i);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// then later in a method\r\nSparkSession spark = SparkSession.builder()\r\n        .appName(&quot;UDFExample&quot;)\r\n        .config(&quot;spark.master&quot;, &quot;local[*]&quot;)\r\n        .getOrCreate();\r\n\r\nList&lt;Integer&gt; ar = Arrays.asList(2,4,3,6,1,5);\r\nJavaRDD&lt;Integer&gt; outputRdd1 = JavaSparkContext.fromSparkContext(spark.sparkContext()).parallelize(ar).map(x -&gt; {\r\n    try {\r\n        m1(x);\r\n    } catch (Exception e) {\r\n        return x;\r\n    }\r\n    return x;\r\n});\r\n\r\noutputRdd1.collect().forEach( i -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;res was &quot;+i));\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\non a box with enough cores will give:\r\n\r\n```\r\n===thread==Executor task launch worker for task 13.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 13)===value==1\r\n===thread==Executor task launch worker for task 15.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 15)===value==5\r\n===thread==Executor task launch worker for task 5.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 5)===value==4\r\n===thread==Executor task launch worker for task 7.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 7)===value==3\r\n===thread==Executor task launch worker for task 2.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 2)===value==2\r\n===thread==Executor task launch worker for task 10.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 10)===value==6\r\nres was 2\r\nres was 4\r\nres was 3\r\nres was 6\r\nres was 1\r\nres was 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nand a lot of task logging, that&#39;s on OSS 3.4.1.
