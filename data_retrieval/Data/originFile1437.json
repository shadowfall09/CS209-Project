It's... hard.</p>\n<p>The other way is to just use forEach immediately:</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;Item&gt; unstopped = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\nitems.stream().forEach(i -&gt; {\n  if(i.children.isEmpty()) {\n      i.stop()     \n    } else {\n      unstopped.add(i)\n    })\n  });\n</code></pre>\n<p>And that works. And it's kind of honest. But it's still just the same old loop-based way of doing it.</p>\n<p>You might get away with using teeing, but it's still iffy. <a href=\"https://dzone.com/articles/java-12-the-teeing-collector\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://dzone.com/articles/java-12-the-teeing-collector</a></p>\n<p>Or you could do what @Alexander Ivanchenko suggested, which works just fine. But I would ask myself this question first:</p>\n<p>&quot;Do I really need to use streams? Since I'm dealing with stateful side effects anyway, what's wrong with using the other syntax that handles that sort of thing really well instead?&quot;</p>\n<p>If the answer is that yes you need to use a stream, then that's fine. But it might be the wrong hammer for the nail.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":93689,"reputation":415931,"user_id":256196,"accept_rate":77,"display_name":"Bohemian"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1649458570,"creation_date":1649446064,"answer_id":71802256,"question_id":71795427,"body_markdown":"Use `peek()`:\r\n\r\n    items = items.stream()\r\n      .peek(i -&gt; { if (i.children.isEmpty()) i.stop();})\r\n      .filter(i -&gt; !i.children.isEmpty())\r\n      .collect(toList());\r\n\r\n","title":"Java lambda: combine doSomething() and removeIf() in one iteration","body":"<p>Use <code>peek()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>items = items.stream()\n  .peek(i -&gt; { if (i.children.isEmpty()) i.stop();})\n  .filter(i -&gt; !i.children.isEmpty())\n  .collect(toList());\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":6528825,"reputation":21455,"user_id":5050667,"accept_rate":91,"display_name":"Yassin Hajaj"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1649761080,"creation_date":1649460689,"answer_id":71804066,"question_id":71795427,"body_markdown":"Let&#39;s think about it differently.\r\nUse a second collection for this purpose.\r\nYou don&#39;t even need the `Stream` API\r\n\r\n```\r\nList&lt;X&gt; items = ...\r\nSet&lt;X&gt; itemsToBeStopped = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(items);\r\n\r\nitems.removeIf(x -&gt; x.children.isEmpty());\r\nitemsToBeStopped.removeAll(items);\r\n\r\nitemsToBeStopped.forEach(x::stop);\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust make sure your `equals` and `hashcode` methods are overridden properly","title":"Java lambda: combine doSomething() and removeIf() in one iteration","body":"<p>Let's think about it differently.\nUse a second collection for this purpose.\nYou don't even need the <code>Stream</code> API</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;X&gt; items = ...\nSet&lt;X&gt; itemsToBeStopped = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(items);\n\nitems.removeIf(x -&gt; x.children.isEmpty());\nitemsToBeStopped.removeAll(items);\n\nitemsToBeStopped.forEach(x::stop);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Just make sure your <code>equals</code> and <code>hashcode</code> methods are overridden properly</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":15612617,"reputation":3744,"user_id":11263560,"display_name":"recnac"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":442,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":4,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1649761080,"creation_date":1649413600,"question_id":71795427,"body_markdown":"I want to filter some elements and call `stop()` function, and then remove them.

If that's not possible, I'm open to other suggestions.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","hashmap","set","java-stream","java-11"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":785560,"reputation":14879,"user_id":845414,"display_name":"Johannes Kuhn"},"score":1,"creation_date":1646313362,"post_id":71334983,"comment_id":126095457,"body_markdown":"`map.values().stream().reduce(new HashSet&lt;Integer&gt;(map.values().iterator().next()), (s1, s2) -&gt; {s1.retainAll(s2)\n; return s1;});` Or simpler: `Set&lt;Integer&gt; common = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(map.values.iterator().next()); map.values().forEach(s -&gt; common.retainAll(s));`","body":"<code>map.values().stream().reduce(new HashSet&lt;Integer&gt;(map.values().iterator().next()), (s1, s2) -&gt; {s1.retainAll(s2) ; return s1;});</code> Or simpler: <code>Set&lt;Integer&gt; common = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(map.values.iterator().next()); map.values().forEach(s -&gt; common.retainAll(s));</code>"},{"owner":{"account_id":3211603,"reputation":289297,"user_id":2711488,"display_name":"Holger"},"score":2,"creation_date":1646331121,"post_id":71334983,"comment_id":126102651,"body_markdown":"@JohannesKuhn or avoid unnecessary work by using `Iterator&lt;Integer&gt; i = map.values().iterator(); Set&lt;Integer&gt; common = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(i.next()); i.forEachRemaining(s -&gt; common.retainAll(s));`","body":"@JohannesKuhn or avoid unnecessary work by using <code>Iterator&lt;Integer&gt; i = map.values().iterator(); Set&lt;Integer&gt; common = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(i.next()); i.forEachRemaining(s -&gt; common.retainAll(s));</code>"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":10310871,"reputation":25632,"user_id":7606764,"display_name":"Andronicus"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1646300909,"creation_date":1646300909,"answer_id":71335078,"question_id":71334983,"body_markdown":"First note that using stream is not always the cleanest way.\r\n\r\nMy idea would be to get the first set and iterate over the rest to check if all of them contain it:\r\n\r\n    Set&lt;Integer&gt; res = map.values().iterator().next().stream()\r\n                .filter(item -&gt; map.values().stream().allMatch(set -&gt; set.contains(item)))\r\n                .collect(Collectors.toSet());\r\n\r\nThis is a concise solution but it checks the first set twice.

I found the below code from stackoverflow which i used in my project, but can you tell me what i am doing wrong.</p>\n\n<pre><code> if(android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= 11){\n        // will update the \"progress\" propriety of seekbar until it reaches progress\n        ObjectAnimator animation = ObjectAnimator.ofInt(progressBarTimer, \"progress\", 0, 500);\n        animation.setDuration(20000); // 0.5 second\n        animation.setInterpolator(new LinearInterpolator());\n        animation.start();\n    }\n    else\n        progressBarTimer.setProgress(100);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ybcix.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ybcix.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n"},{"tags":["java","hibernate","jpa"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":9571720,"reputation":6305,"user_id":7109162,"accept_rate":84,"display_name":"XtremeBaumer"},"score":0,"creation_date":1649751058,"post_id":71838807,"comment_id":126949062,"body_markdown":"Try `@AttributeOverride(name = &quot;id&quot;, column = @Column(name = &quot;id&quot;))` over `@EmbeddedId`","body":"Try <code>@AttributeOverride(name = &quot;id&quot;, column = @Column(name = &quot;id&quot;))</code> over <code>@EmbeddedId</code>"},{"owner":{"account_id":10536282,"reputation":164,"user_id":7764065,"display_name":"Javid"},"score":0,"creation_date":1649752326,"post_id":71838807,"comment_id":126949520,"body_markdown":"Thanks a lot  @XtremeBaumer it worked fine but is there a way to use getter to map that?","body":"Thanks a lot  @XtremeBaumer it worked fine but is there a way to use getter to map that?"},{"owner":{"account_id":9571720,"reputation":6305,"user_id":7109162,"accept_rate":84,"display_name":"XtremeBaumer"},"score":1,"creation_date":1649752953,"post_id":71838807,"comment_id":126949748,"body_markdown":"I wouldn&#39;t mix annotations on fields with annotations on getter/setter.
