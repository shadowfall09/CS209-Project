Different forms of polymorphism exist in all the programming paradigms and not in all languages you are forced to use polymorphism to implement a strategy pattern (e.g. functional languages).\r\n\r\nFor further discussion on this topic please read [this other answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11732581/697630) where we have discussed whether polymorphism is possible without inheritance and I provide interesting references and examples to other types of polymorphism like parametric and ad-hoc polymorphism.\r\n\r\nIdeally this will reveal to you that polymorphism is a bigger concept that goes beyond the boundaries of object-oriented programming and even beyond inheritance and subtyping.    \r\n\r\n&gt; **Q:** I&#39;m confused that whatever is achieved via Strategy Pattern is\r\n&gt; basically possible by polymorphism. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong in this\r\n&gt; regard.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view the relations between these two concepts are: that the strategy pattern leverages the power of polymorphism available in languages like Java to implement its intent, and that polymorphism can be considered in itself a pattern.\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider this quote from the GoF book:\r\n\r\n&gt; If we assumed procedural languages, we might have included design\r\n&gt; patterns called &#39;inheritance&#39;, &#39;encapsulation&#39; and &#39;polymorphism&#39;.\r\n\r\nIt is just that we rarely think of polymorphism as a pattern, first because it implies many things and because it is implemented differently in different languages and also because it typically presents as some form of language feature.\r\n\r\nIn his book Elemental Design Patterns, Jason Mc C. Smith comments on the GoF quote above saying:\r\n\r\n&gt; Pattern are language-independent concepts; they take form and become\r\n&gt; concrete solutions when you implement them within a particular\r\n&gt; language with a given set of language features and constructs [...]\r\n&gt; This means that it is a bit strange to talk about &quot;Java design\r\n&gt; pattern&quot;, &quot;C++ design patterns&quot;, &quot;Websphere design pattern&quot; and so on,\r\n&gt; even though we all do it. It&#39;s a mildly lazy form of shorthand for\r\n&gt; what we really mean, or should mean: design patterns as implemented in\r\n&gt; Java, C++, WebSphere and so on, regardless of language or API.\r\n\r\nSo, as you can see, you are thinking in the Strategy pattern from the perspective of the Java implementation, but in other language paradigms such pattern may have been implemented in different ways, probably without using inheritance at all, for example, in pure functional programming languages this is most certainly implemented using [high order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) and [function composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science)).\r\n\r\nAs such, this would be an strategy pattern implementation without resorting to *inclusion polymorphism* at all. In a function composition strategy we may still be using other forms of polymorphism (e.g. parametric), but that is not a requirement for the strategy pattern \r\n\r\n&gt; Q: Please, also provide me example to eradicate my confusion.\r\n\r\nAs discussed above, in Java we are probably forced to use inclusion polymorphism to implement a Strategy pattern, but as explained above as well, patterns are not something that belong to a specific language, so if we think of the strategy pattern as a concept living outside any language boundaries then you will easily see other languages implement this in different ways.\r\n\r\nIn some hypothetical functional language I may have a function that reads some data from a file, maybe the file is encrypted and you need to provide a decryption strategy:\r\n\r\n    function readFile(path: String, decrypt: string -&gt; string) {\r\n        return decrypt(loadFromDisk(path));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd that `decrypt` argument is a function that serves the purpose of a strategy pattern, it encapsulates an interchangeable algorithm.\r\n\r\nNow you can do\r\n\r\n    readFile(&quot;customers.txt&quot;, aes)\r\n    readFile(&quot;finance.txt&quot;, blowfish)\r\n\r\nWhere `aes` and `blowfish` are decryption function strategies.\r\n\r\nThere are dozens of languages that work like this, SML, Haskell, JavaScript, etc.","title":"Polymorphism vs Strategy pattern","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the difference between the Strategy pattern and Polymorphism\n  in Java?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The questions is certainly confusing since initially there seems not to be any  relation between these two ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Polymorphism is a much broader concept in programming and yes the strategy pattern in Java uses a form of polymorphism catalogued as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_%28computer_science%29#Subtyping\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">inclusion polymorphism</a> to accomplish its intent, but this is by no means the only type of polymorphism that exists, neither it is the only way to implement the strategy pattern as I will demonstrate soon.</p>\n\n<p>Also polymorphism is not something that only exists in Java or in object-oriented programming languages.

Smith comments on the GoF quote above saying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Pattern are language-independent concepts; they take form and become\n  concrete solutions when you implement them within a particular\n  language with a given set of language features and constructs [...]\n  This means that it is a bit strange to talk about \"Java design\n  pattern\", \"C++ design patterns\", \"Websphere design pattern\" and so on,\n  even though we all do it. It's a mildly lazy form of shorthand for\n  what we really mean, or should mean: design patterns as implemented in\n  Java, C++, WebSphere and so on, regardless of language or API.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, as you can see, you are thinking in the Strategy pattern from the perspective of the Java implementation, but in other language paradigms such pattern may have been implemented in different ways, probably without using inheritance at all, for example, in pure functional programming languages this is most certainly implemented using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">high order functions</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">function composition</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As such, this would be an strategy pattern implementation without resorting to <em>inclusion polymorphism</em> at all. In a function composition strategy we may still be using other forms of polymorphism (e.g. parametric), but that is not a requirement for the strategy pattern </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Q: Please, also provide me example to eradicate my confusion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As discussed above, in Java we are probably forced to use inclusion polymorphism to implement a Strategy pattern, but as explained above as well, patterns are not something that belong to a specific language, so if we think of the strategy pattern as a concept living outside any language boundaries then you will easily see other languages implement this in different ways.</p>\n\n<p>In some hypothetical functional language I may have a function that reads some data from a file, maybe the file is encrypted and you need to provide a decryption strategy:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function readFile(path: String, decrypt: string -&gt; string) {\n    return decrypt(loadFromDisk(path));\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And that <code>decrypt</code> argument is a function that serves the purpose of a strategy pattern, it encapsulates an interchangeable algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>Now you can do</p>\n\n<pre><code>readFile(\"customers.txt\", aes)\nreadFile(\"finance.txt\", blowfish)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where <code>aes</code> and <code>blowfish</code> are decryption function strategies.</p>\n\n<p>There are dozens of languages that work like this, SML, Haskell, JavaScript, etc.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2718863,"reputation":154,"user_id":2345592,"display_name":"Omar Ayala"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1442531577,"creation_date":1442531577,"answer_id":32641396,"question_id":31608902,"body_markdown":"One definition for Polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind say you have a “bird” interface and all of your bird classes must implement “laysEggs()” method, well no biggie that works.

It calculates the force of gravity on the surface of the planet for an object of the given mass.\r\n\r\nThe formula for the gravity is following:\r\n[![newtons law of gravity][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, `G`, `m₁` and `r&#178;` are properties of the planet, while `m₂` is the property of the object on the surface of the planet.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne way to design the `PlanetSurfaceGravityForceFormula` is to have it contain all the state necessary for the calculation:\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass PlanetSurfaceGravityForceFormula {\r\n  double G, r, m1, m2;\r\n  public double calculateForce() {...}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, when you need to calculate force, you&#39;ll need to create new instance of `PlanetSurfaceGravityForceFormula` with all the relevant constants and call the `calculateForce` method. \r\n\r\nWhich is fine, unless you know beforehand that you need to perform the calculation on the limited fixed number of the planets, and only `m₂` is expected to change with each call.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo your new design for the `PlanetSurfaceGravityForceFormula` is this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass PlanetSurfaceGravityForceFormula {\r\n  double G, r, m1;\r\n  public double calculateForce(double m2) {...}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee what happened here? `m₂` was a part of the intrinsic state before, but now it becomes the extrinsic state, as it&#39;s passed from outside for each method call.\r\n\r\nThis design has several advantages over the previous one:\r\n1.

It calculates the force of gravity on the surface of the planet for an object of the given mass.</p>\n<p>The formula for the gravity is following:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KOrzQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KOrzQ.png\" alt=\"newtons law of gravity\" /></a></p>\n<p>Here, <code>G</code>, <code>m₁</code> and <code>r²</code> are properties of the planet, while <code>m₂</code> is the property of the object on the surface of the planet.</p>\n<p>One way to design the <code>PlanetSurfaceGravityForceFormula</code> is to have it contain all the state necessary for the calculation:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>class PlanetSurfaceGravityForceFormula {\n  double G, r, m1, m2;\n  public double calculateForce() {...}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, when you need to calculate force, you'll need to create new instance of <code>PlanetSurfaceGravityForceFormula</code> with all the relevant constants and call the <code>calculateForce</code> method.</p>\n<p>Which is fine, unless you know beforehand that you need to perform the calculation on the limited fixed number of the planets, and only <code>m₂</code> is expected to change with each call.</p>\n<p>So your new design for the <code>PlanetSurfaceGravityForceFormula</code> is this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>class PlanetSurfaceGravityForceFormula {\n  double G, r, m1;\n  public double calculateForce(double m2) {...}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>See what happened here? <code>m₂</code> was a part of the intrinsic state before, but now it becomes the extrinsic state, as it's passed from outside for each method call.</p>\n<p>This design has several advantages over the previous one:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It's possible to reuse the same instance of <code>PlanetSurfaceGravityForceFormula</code> for different values of <code>m2</code></li>\n<li>If the planets are fixed and known in advance, it's possible to create static constants of the <code>PlanetSurfaceGravityForceFormula</code> for each such planet and use them for calculation</li>\n<li>If the planets are known to be limited, but not known in advance, it's possible to create some kind of <code>PlanetSurfaceGravityForceFormulaFactory</code> that returns cached instances of the <code>PlanetSurfaceGravityForceFormula</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p>Hopefully this helps to understand the difference between &quot;intrinsic&quot; and &quot;extrinsic&quot; state of the object.</p>\n<p>One thing that I'd like to emphasize is that in real life you seldom need to &quot;force&quot; parts of the intrinsic state to become &quot;extrinsic&quot;.

The main other issue in you code is instead of saving the score value for printing and other usage, it kept initializing new Quizes and running compareAnswers() in these new instances. You need to save the score value in the Quiz class, and use that stored value.\r\n 3. Lastly, in the askQuestionsOneByOne() you are returning the user answers, but never use them. Instead, in compareAnswers() you are again initializing new Lists. \r\n\r\nYou can fix the Quiz class by adding a score field (first code example below).

As of 2021-09-30, Hellberg has posted a new version of that tutorial aimed at Vaadin 22 rather than 14. This Answer addresses the version 22 tutorial. \r\n\r\n - See [tutorial video posted on YouTube][1].\r\n - See [written tutorial web page][2] on Vaadin.com site.\r\n\r\n# Install *pnpm* first, then *Node.js* &amp; *npm*\r\n\r\nVaadin Flow relies on some third-party tools to accomplish its JavaScript &amp; Web Components chores. Those tools include: \r\n\r\n - [pnpm][3]\r\n - [Node.js][4]\r\n - [npm][5]\r\n\r\nLater versions of Vaadin Flow are designed to auto-install these tools with Vaadin itself. Unfortunately, that auto-install fails on Macs having [Apple Silicon][6]. I presume this failure will be fixed in the future, but for now follow this workaround: Install those three tools on your Mac. Vaadin Flow will then be able to find and use those tools, thereby making moot the auto-install problem.\r\n\r\nOne key issue is that you must **install *pnpm* on your Mac *first***. Only after that should you install *Node.js* (which also installs *npm*). I did the reverse, and experienced problems that I could only fix by painstakingly removing every one of the many pieces in many places installed by Node.js &amp; npm. \r\n\r\n## Install *pnpm* \r\n\r\nInstalling *pnpm* is a not straightforward, as no installer app is available. \r\n\r\n 1. In your home folder, create an empty text file named exactly `.zshrc`. The [Z shell][7] is the default [shell][8] for terminal work on [macOS Big Sur][9]. The `.zshrc` file is a place to put configuration commands that take effect when you start a new shell session (a new window/tab in Terminal.app). [Search to learn more][10].\r\n 2. As shown [here][11], in [Terminal.app][12] run this line `sudo curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -`. This downloads and executes a shell script which performs the installation of *pnpm*. You will be prompted for your admin password ([*Caveat emptor*][13]). \r\n\r\nIf the installation was successful, you will find that `.zshrc` is no longer empty:\r\n\r\n```zsh\r\nexport PNPM_HOME=&quot;/Users/your_user_name/Library/pnpm&quot;\r\nexport PATH=&quot;$PNPM_HOME:$PATH&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Install *Node.js* and *npm*\r\n\r\nNow proceed with the installation of *Node.js* &amp; *npm*. \r\n\r\nAnother key issue with the auto-install failure is that the current mainstream version of Node.js is not yet native to the [Apple M1 chip][14]. I used [this Answer][15] to learn that for an M1 MacBook ([ARM][16] chip) I needed to get the bleeding-edge version 16.10.0 of NodeJS installer. \r\n\r\nDownloading and running that installer successfully installed an [Apple Silicon][17] native version of *Node* &amp; *npm*. Having those installed allowed that Vaadin tutorial app to run. \r\n\r\n[![screenshot of NodeJS installer for Apple Silicon native version][18]][18]\r\n\r\n## Uninstalling\r\n\r\nUninstalling *pnpm*, *Node.js*, and *npm* is not a simple matter. You must search the web for tips posted by various people where they list all the nooks and crannies in your file system where you might find folders and files to be deleted. \r\n\r\nDoing all those deletions is laborious, be forewarned. This is why the Vaadin team added that functionality to auto-install these tools within the Vaadin environment. Unfortunately, until that auto-install feature is fixed for M1 Macs, we on the bleeding-edge of processor technology need to do this manual install, and later, uninstall. Not the end of the world, just a chore; a small price to pay for the wonderful benefits of Vaadin Flow. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Security caveat\r\n\r\nBe aware that JavaScript tooling such as *pnpm*, *Node.js*, and *npm* carry significant security risks. \r\n\r\n - Read up on the issues, for your own education and judgment.\r\n - Follow the steps listed here **at your own risk**. No guarantees, warranty, or responsibility is provided by me.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I have become concerned enough about this risk that I no longer do any development work with these tools on any computer with sensitive personal info or apps. I now do development work only on separate machines dedicated to that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the way, I found that after I installed Node/npm, I could also (a) change from Java 16 to 17, and (b) update all the versions in the POM to their latest. The Vaadin tutorial app continued to run successfully after these updates.\r\n\r\nSo my POM looks like this:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n&lt;project xmlns=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0&quot;\r\n    xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;\r\n    &lt;!-- Vaadin project from https://start.vaadin.com/project/53571864-5e36-488b-8d11-d91844066446 --&gt;\r\n    &lt;groupId&gt;com.example.application&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;flowcrmtutorial&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    &lt;name&gt;Project base for Spring Boot and Vaadin Flow&lt;/name&gt;\r\n    &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;\r\n    &lt;packaging&gt;jar&lt;/packaging&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;properties&gt;\r\n        &lt;java.version&gt;17&lt;/java.version&gt;\r\n        &lt;vaadin.version&gt;14.7.0&lt;/vaadin.version&gt;\r\n    &lt;/properties&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;parent&gt;\r\n        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;version&gt;2.5.5&lt;/version&gt;\r\n    &lt;/parent&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;repositories&gt;\r\n        &lt;!-- The order of definitions matters.

AArch64 versus Intel x86 chip)","body":"<h1>Vaadin Flow 14 versus 22</h1>\n<p>The Question asks about the Vaadin 14 + Spring Boot tutorial by Marcus Hellberg. As of 2021-09-30, Hellberg has posted a new version of that tutorial aimed at Vaadin 22 rather than 14. This Answer addresses the version 22 tutorial.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>See <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxy2JgqqKDU\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tutorial video posted on YouTube</a>.</li>\n<li>See <a href=\"https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/flow/tutorials/in-depth-course/project-setup\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">written tutorial web page</a> on Vaadin.com site.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Install <em>pnpm</em> first, then <em>Node.js</em> &amp; <em>npm</em></h1>\n<p>Vaadin Flow relies on some third-party tools to accomplish its JavaScript &amp; Web Components chores. Those tools include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pnpm.io/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pnpm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Node.js</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">npm</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Later versions of Vaadin Flow are designed to auto-install these tools with Vaadin itself. Unfortunately, that auto-install fails on Macs having <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apple Silicon</a>. I presume this failure will be fixed in the future, but for now follow this workaround: Install those three tools on your Mac. Vaadin Flow will then be able to find and use those tools, thereby making moot the auto-install problem.</p>\n<p>One key issue is that you must <strong>install <em>pnpm</em> on your Mac <em>first</em></strong>. Only after that should you install <em>Node.js</em> (which also installs <em>npm</em>). I did the reverse, and experienced problems that I could only fix by painstakingly removing every one of the many pieces in many places installed by Node.js &amp; npm.</p>\n<h2>Install <em>pnpm</em></h2>\n<p>Installing <em>pnpm</em> is a not straightforward, as no installer app is available.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In your home folder, create an empty text file named exactly <code>.zshrc</code>. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Z shell</a> is the default <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">shell</a> for terminal work on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Big_Sur\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">macOS Big Sur</a>. The <code>.zshrc</code> file is a place to put configuration commands that take effect when you start a new shell session (a new window/tab in Terminal.app). <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=.zshrc%20file&amp;t=osx&amp;ia=web\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Search to learn more</a>.</li>\n<li>As shown <a href=\"https://pnpm.io/installation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Terminal.app</a> run this line <code>sudo curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -</code>. This downloads and executes a shell script which performs the installation of <em>pnpm</em>. You will be prompted for your admin password (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caveat_emptor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Caveat emptor</em></a>).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If the installation was successful, you will find that <code>.zshrc</code> is no longer empty:</p>\n<pre><code>export PNPM_HOME=&quot;/Users/your_user_name/Library/pnpm&quot;\nexport PATH=&quot;$PNPM_HOME:$PATH&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Install <em>Node.js</em> and <em>npm</em></h2>\n<p>Now proceed with the installation of <em>Node.js</em> &amp; <em>npm</em>.</p>\n<p>Another key issue with the auto-install failure is that the current mainstream version of Node.js is not yet native to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apple M1 chip</a>. I used <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/68258283/642706\">this Answer</a> to learn that for an M1 MacBook (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ARM</a> chip) I needed to get the bleeding-edge version 16.10.0 of NodeJS installer.</p>\n<p>Downloading and running that installer successfully installed an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Silicon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apple Silicon</a> native version of <em>Node</em> &amp; <em>npm</em>. Having those installed allowed that Vaadin tutorial app to run.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/W75B9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/W75B9.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of NodeJS installer for Apple Silicon native version\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Uninstalling</h2>\n<p>Uninstalling <em>pnpm</em>, <em>Node.js</em>, and <em>npm</em> is not a simple matter. You must search the web for tips posted by various people where they list all the nooks and crannies in your file system where you might find folders and files to be deleted.</p>\n<p>Doing all those deletions is laborious, be forewarned. This is why the Vaadin team added that functionality to auto-install these tools within the Vaadin environment. Unfortunately, until that auto-install feature is fixed for M1 Macs, we on the bleeding-edge of processor technology need to do this manual install, and later, uninstall. Not the end of the world, just a chore; a small price to pay for the wonderful benefits of Vaadin Flow.</p>\n<h2>Security caveat</h2>\n<p>Be aware that JavaScript tooling such as <em>pnpm</em>, <em>Node.js</em>, and <em>npm</em> carry significant security risks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read up on the issues, for your own education and judgment.</li>\n<li>Follow the steps listed here <strong>at your own risk</strong>. No guarantees, warranty, or responsibility is provided by me.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Frankly, I have become concerned enough about this risk that I no longer do any development work with these tools on any computer with sensitive personal info or apps. I now do development work only on separate machines dedicated to that purpose.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>By the way, I found that after I installed Node/npm, I could also (a) change from Java 16 to 17, and (b) update all the versions in the POM to their latest. The Vaadin tutorial app continued to run successfully after these updates.</p>\n<p>So my POM looks like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;project xmlns=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0&quot;\n    xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Vaadin project from https://start.vaadin.com/project/53571864-5e36-488b-8d11-d91844066446 --&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;com.example.application&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;flowcrmtutorial&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;name&gt;Project base for Spring Boot and Vaadin Flow&lt;/name&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;packaging&gt;jar&lt;/packaging&gt;\n\n    &lt;properties&gt;\n        &lt;java.version&gt;17&lt;/java.version&gt;\n        &lt;vaadin.version&gt;14.7.0&lt;/vaadin.version&gt;\n    &lt;/properties&gt;\n\n    &lt;parent&gt;\n        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n        &lt;version&gt;2.5.5&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;/parent&gt;\n\n    &lt;repositories&gt;\n        &lt;!-- The order of definitions matters.
