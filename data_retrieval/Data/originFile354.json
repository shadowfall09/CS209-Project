Even [this project page][2] that contains examples of usages has at least one typo (`HorizontalAlign.right` instead of `HorizontalAlign.RIGHT`). However, it&#39;s in the Maven Central repository (unlike [iNamik&#39;s Text Table Formatter][3]), pretty flexible, easy to use, and it works. Here&#39;s the fixed &quot;advanced&quot; example provided by the library&#39;s creators\r\n```java\r\npublic class Advanced {\r\n\r\n  public static void main(final String[] args) {\r\n\r\n    CellStyle numberStyle = new CellStyle(HorizontalAlign.RIGHT);\r\n\r\n    Table t = new Table(3, BorderStyle.DESIGN_FORMAL,\r\n        ShownBorders.SURROUND_HEADER_FOOTER_AND_COLUMNS);\r\n    t.setColumnWidth(0, 8, 14);\r\n    t.setColumnWidth(1, 7, 16);\r\n    t.setColumnWidth(2, 9, 16);\r\n    \r\n    t.addCell(&quot;Region&quot;);\r\n    t.addCell(&quot;Orders&quot;, numberStyle);\r\n    t.addCell(&quot;Sales&quot;, numberStyle);\r\n\r\n    t.addCell(&quot;North&quot;);\r\n    t.addCell(&quot;6,345&quot;, numberStyle);\r\n    t.addCell(&quot;$87.230&quot;, numberStyle);\r\n\r\n    t.addCell(&quot;Center&quot;);\r\n    t.addCell(&quot;837&quot;, numberStyle);\r\n    t.addCell(&quot;$12.855&quot;, numberStyle);\r\n\r\n    t.addCell(&quot;South&quot;);\r\n    t.addCell(&quot;5,344&quot;, numberStyle);\r\n    t.addCell(&quot;$72.561&quot;, numberStyle);\r\n\r\n    t.addCell(&quot;Total&quot;, numberStyle, 2);\r\n    t.addCell(&quot;$172.646&quot;, numberStyle);\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(t.render());\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\n==========================\r\nRegion    Orders     Sales\r\n-------- ------- ---------\r\nNorth      6,345   $87.230\r\nCenter       837   $12.855\r\nSouth      5,344   $72.561\r\n-------- ------- ---------\r\n           Total  $172.646\r\n==========================\r\n```\r\nAnother option (I personally like it more) is [ASCII Table][4].

Here's the fixed &quot;advanced&quot; example provided by the library's creators</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class Advanced {\n\n  public static void main(final String[] args) {\n\n    CellStyle numberStyle = new CellStyle(HorizontalAlign.RIGHT);\n\n    Table t = new Table(3, BorderStyle.DESIGN_FORMAL,\n        ShownBorders.SURROUND_HEADER_FOOTER_AND_COLUMNS);\n    t.setColumnWidth(0, 8, 14);\n    t.setColumnWidth(1, 7, 16);\n    t.setColumnWidth(2, 9, 16);\n    \n    t.addCell(&quot;Region&quot;);\n    t.addCell(&quot;Orders&quot;, numberStyle);\n    t.addCell(&quot;Sales&quot;, numberStyle);\n\n    t.addCell(&quot;North&quot;);\n    t.addCell(&quot;6,345&quot;, numberStyle);\n    t.addCell(&quot;$87.230&quot;, numberStyle);\n\n    t.addCell(&quot;Center&quot;);\n    t.addCell(&quot;837&quot;, numberStyle);\n    t.addCell(&quot;$12.855&quot;, numberStyle);\n\n    t.addCell(&quot;South&quot;);\n    t.addCell(&quot;5,344&quot;, numberStyle);\n    t.addCell(&quot;$72.561&quot;, numberStyle);\n\n    t.addCell(&quot;Total&quot;, numberStyle, 2);\n    t.addCell(&quot;$172.646&quot;, numberStyle);\n\n    System.out.println(t.render());\n  }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Output:</p>\n<pre><code>==========================\nRegion    Orders     Sales\n-------- ------- ---------\nNorth      6,345   $87.230\nCenter       837   $12.855\nSouth      5,344   $72.561\n-------- ------- ---------\n           Total  $172.646\n==========================\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another option (I personally like it more) is <a href=\"https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/de.vandermeer/asciitable/0.3.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ASCII Table</a>. Unlike the previous library, it has a good <a href=\"http://www.vandermeer.de/projects/skb/java/asciitable\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">user guide</a>, <a href=\"http://www.vandermeer.de/projects/skb/java/asciitable/apidocs/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JavaDocs</a>, and multiple versions in Maven Central (which implies it was maintained, at least for a while, the last one is of May 2017). Here's an example of what you can do with it (I'll omit the class and main method declarations)</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>        AsciiTable table = new AsciiTable();\n        table.getContext().setGrid(A8_Grids.lineDobuleTripple());\n        table.addHeavyRule();\n        table.addRow(null, null, &quot;Countries&quot;);\n        table.addHeavyRule();\n        table.addRow(&quot;Country&quot;, &quot;Capital&quot;, &quot;Population&quot;);\n        table.addRule();\n        table.addRow(&quot;United States&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;333,287,557&quot;);\n        table.addRow(&quot;United Kingdom&quot;, &quot;London&quot;, &quot;68,138,484&quot;);\n        table.addRow(&quot;Australia&quot;, &quot;Canberra&quot;, &quot;26,540,400&quot;);\n        table.addHeavyRule();\n        System.out.println(table.render());\n</code></pre>\n<p>Output:</p>\n<pre><code>≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡\n Countries                                                                      \n≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡\n Country                    Capital                   Population                \n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n United States              Washington                333,287,557               \n United Kingdom             London                    68,138,484                \n Australia                  Canberra                  26,540,400                \n≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":10611,"reputation":110107,"user_id":20128,"accept_rate":73,"display_name":"serg"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":11788,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":21,"accepted_answer_id":5609723,"answer_count":6,"score":21,"last_activity_date":1687432460,"creation_date":1302391098,"question_id":5608588,"body_markdown":"I need to output data into a console as a table.

I don&#39;t have direct access, so I need to do it via a Jump server.\r\n\r\nFirst I tested it out using basic SSH port forwarding commands. I logged into the Jump server and ran the following command: (port 34567 has no significance, just a random port)\r\n\r\n```\r\nraddaya@jumpserver&gt; ssh -L *:34567:RemoteServer.com:22 [user]@JumpServer.com\r\n```\r\nAfter this, I logged into my Java server and saw if it worked:\r\n\r\n```\r\nraddaya@javaserver&gt; ssh [user]@JumpServer.com -p 34567\r\n````\r\nAs expected, it logged me into the Remote Server! So far, so good.\r\n\r\nI wrote some Java code that looked roughly like this: [can&#39;t directly copy/paste the code, so please excuse typos]\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nSession jumpSession = jSch.getSession(jumpServerUsername,jumpServerAddress,22);\r\njumpSession.setPassword(jumpServerpw);\r\njumpSession.setConfig(STRICTHOSTKEYCHECKING,&quot;no&quot;);\r\njumpSession.connect();\r\n\r\n//now forward the port\r\nint forwardedPort = jumpSession.setPortForwardingL(&quot;*&quot;,0,remoteServerAddress,22);\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Port forwarding rules: &quot; + Arrays.toString(jumpSession.getPortForwardingL()));\r\n\r\nSession remoteSession = jSch.getSession(jumpServerUsername,jumpServerAddress,forwardedPort);\r\nremoteSession.setPassword(jumpServerpw);\r\nremoteSession.setConfig(STRICTHOSTKEYCHECKING,&quot;no&quot;);\r\nremoteSession.connect();\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe port forwarding rule was properly printed here, it would pick a random port between ~30,000 to ~50,000 and forward the port.

I don't have direct access, so I need to do it via a Jump server.</p>\n<p>First I tested it out using basic SSH port forwarding commands. I logged into the Jump server and ran the following command: (port 34567 has no significance, just a random port)</p>\n<pre><code>raddaya@jumpserver&gt; ssh -L *:34567:RemoteServer.com:22 [user]@JumpServer.com\n</code></pre>\n<p>After this, I logged into my Java server and saw if it worked:</p>\n<pre><code>raddaya@javaserver&gt; ssh [user]@JumpServer.com -p 34567\n</code></pre>\n<p>As expected, it logged me into the Remote Server! So far, so good.</p>\n<p>I wrote some Java code that looked roughly like this: [can't directly copy/paste the code, so please excuse typos]</p>\n<pre><code>Session jumpSession = jSch.getSession(jumpServerUsername,jumpServerAddress,22);\njumpSession.setPassword(jumpServerpw);\njumpSession.setConfig(STRICTHOSTKEYCHECKING,&quot;no&quot;);\njumpSession.connect();\n\n//now forward the port\nint forwardedPort = jumpSession.setPortForwardingL(&quot;*&quot;,0,remoteServerAddress,22);\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Port forwarding rules: &quot; + Arrays.toString(jumpSession.getPortForwardingL()));\n\nSession remoteSession = jSch.getSession(jumpServerUsername,jumpServerAddress,forwardedPort);\nremoteSession.setPassword(jumpServerpw);\nremoteSession.setConfig(STRICTHOSTKEYCHECKING,&quot;no&quot;);\nremoteSession.connect();\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>The port forwarding rule was properly printed here, it would pick a random port between ~30,000 to ~50,000 and forward the port.

In particular:\r\n\r\n&gt; If no default constructor is available, but at least one &quot;matching&quot; constructor is available, that one is used\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; [...]\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; If no default constructor is available, no &quot;matching&quot; constructor is available, but [`Settings.isMapConstructorParameterNames()`][2] is turned on, and parameter names are available through reflection on [`Executable.getParameters()`][3], the first constructor is used\r\n\r\nKey here is the understanding of the word *&quot;matching&quot;*, which, by default, means matching by arity. If you project 3 columns, jOOQ by default will look only for 3-parameter constructors. This works in the same way as a lot of SQL operators, including `UNION` or `ROW` comparisons, where column names are irrelevant, and only column ordinals matter.\r\n\r\nIf there are only 2-parameter constructors for a 3-column row, jOOQ can&#39;t just assume that you omitted a parameter only for a given argument. Which one would you have omitted? The first, second, or third?\r\n\r\nYou could try making a case in favour of being lenient here, but it would be *very* confusing to get this consistent with the rest of the [`DefaultRecordMapper`][1] specification, as well as with future potential features, so jOOQ just won&#39;t do it.\r\n\r\nHowever, a `record` formally exposes its canonical constructor&#39;s parameter names, so if you do turn on [`Settings.isMapConstructorParameterNames()`][2], then your expectations will be met, even if you re-order your arguments, as long as you make sure they&#39;re named `id` and `name`. Do note that this flag will apply to *all* mappings with access to your `Settings`, so that will be quite the change for any other mappings, including ones that map by index but potentially mis-name a SQL column! Note, only `record` types expose their parameter names in Java, not ordinary constructors (by default), so this flag will only work for records.\r\n\r\nIf you use a mutable POJO with only a default constructor, however, then fields are again mapped by name (which is the only sensible option, in that case).\r\n\r\n### Alternatives using custom `RecordMapper`\r\n\r\nJust because there&#39;s a `DefaultRecordMapper` doesn&#39;t mean you have to use it for everything mapping related. You have quite a specific use-case, which you probably re-use quite often in your application, so why not provide jOOQ with an extension via the `RecordMapperProvider` SPI?

In particular:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If no default constructor is available, but at least one &quot;matching&quot; constructor is available, that one is used</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>If no default constructor is available, no &quot;matching&quot; constructor is available, but <a href=\"https://www.jooq.org/javadoc/dev/org.jooq/org/jooq/conf/Settings.html#isMapConstructorParameterNames()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Settings.isMapConstructorParameterNames()</code></a> is turned on, and parameter names are available through reflection on <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/reflect/Executable.html#getParameters()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Executable.getParameters()</code></a>, the first constructor is used</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Key here is the understanding of the word <em>&quot;matching&quot;</em>, which, by default, means matching by arity. If you project 3 columns, jOOQ by default will look only for 3-parameter constructors. This works in the same way as a lot of SQL operators, including <code>UNION</code> or <code>ROW</code> comparisons, where column names are irrelevant, and only column ordinals matter.</p>\n<p>If there are only 2-parameter constructors for a 3-column row, jOOQ can't just assume that you omitted a parameter only for a given argument. Which one would you have omitted? The first, second, or third?</p>\n<p>You could try making a case in favour of being lenient here, but it would be <em>very</em> confusing to get this consistent with the rest of the <a href=\"https://www.jooq.org/javadoc/dev/org.jooq/org/jooq/impl/DefaultRecordMapper.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>DefaultRecordMapper</code></a> specification, as well as with future potential features, so jOOQ just won't do it.</p>\n<p>However, a <code>record</code> formally exposes its canonical constructor's parameter names, so if you do turn on <a href=\"https://www.jooq.org/javadoc/dev/org.jooq/org/jooq/conf/Settings.html#isMapConstructorParameterNames()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Settings.isMapConstructorParameterNames()</code></a>, then your expectations will be met, even if you re-order your arguments, as long as you make sure they're named <code>id</code> and <code>name</code>. Do note that this flag will apply to <em>all</em> mappings with access to your <code>Settings</code>, so that will be quite the change for any other mappings, including ones that map by index but potentially mis-name a SQL column! Note, only <code>record</code> types expose their parameter names in Java, not ordinary constructors (by default), so this flag will only work for records.</p>\n<p>If you use a mutable POJO with only a default constructor, however, then fields are again mapped by name (which is the only sensible option, in that case).</p>\n<h3>Alternatives using custom <code>RecordMapper</code></h3>\n<p>Just because there's a <code>DefaultRecordMapper</code> doesn't mean you have to use it for everything mapping related.

And I doubt that it will be possible later, except Apache POI will decide to program a renderer for documents. \r\n\r\nA table of content consists of a list of headings (paragraphs having heading style) pointing to the page, that heading is placed. And that is the problem. To know on what page a paragraph gets placed, the document needs to be renderd. From file storages point of view, a document consists of an endlies stream of body elements. There may be explicit page breaks, but there need not. If not, only the renderer can determine on which page a body element gets placed. That is dependig on page size, page margins, font size/s, possible explicit row breaks, paragraph spacing/s and much more things.\r\n\r\nApache POI is only to create the Office Open XML files as Microsoft Office would store it.

Not even a getter to get the `TOC` from the document is provided.\r\n\r\nThat easily could be changed by extending `XWPFDocument`.

That method is to add a row to the table of content where the `int page` should give the page, the title is placed on.\r\n\r\nLooking into the source code of [XWPFDocument.java - createTOC](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/poi/tags/REL_5_2_3/poi-ooxml/src/main/java/org/apache/poi/xwpf/usermodel/XWPFDocument.java?view=markup#l1043), we find \r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    toc.addRow(level, par.getText(), 1, &quot;112723803&quot;);\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nThat means a `1` gets set for each `int page` in each row of the table of content. Why? Well, because Apache POI cannot determine on what exact page the found paragraph having heading style is placed. Why? Well, because Apache POI cannot rendering the document. So it sets `1` and delegates the updating the TOC to Microsoft Word, as Microsoft Word will rendering the document while opening.\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\r\nUsing Apache POI it is not possible to update table of content (TOC) of an `XWPFDokument` up to now. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"How to update page numbers in Table of Contents (TOC) or create a TOC with Page numbers in a Word document using Java and Apache POI","body":"<p><strong>About looking for a canonical answer</strong></p>\n<p>Me not member of the Apache POI developer team but have bothered with Apache POI a long time.

This doesn’t mean that the source code or\ntarget (bytecode) needs to be written in version 17, it means that the\nAGP itself requires Java 17, since it is compiled with a JDK in\nversion 17, or at least targetCompatibility is set to version 17.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But I didn't understand them because they condratict each other</p>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":-1,"reputation":1,"user_id":-1,"display_name":"Community"},"score":0,"creation_date":1687426528,"post_id":76528691,"comment_id":134936364,"body_markdown":"Please provide enough code so others can better understand or reproduce the problem.","body":"Please provide enough code so others can better understand or reproduce the problem."}],"owner":{"account_id":28868086,"reputation":1,"user_id":22110359,"display_name":"Samuel"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1687409927,"creation_date":1687409498,"question_id":76528691,"body_markdown":"I have been doing ejb project on netbeans and each time I finished building the newsApp on the ntbeans documentation, I get the same error of not being able to deploy the app. I have confirmed my glassfish is running.
