Assignment Contexts](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.2).\r\n\r\nIt says that a conversion from `int` to `byte` (if it is outside of the range of `byte`) is a **narrowing primitive conversion** and that it **may lose information** (for obvious reasons). It continues by explaining how the conversion is done:\r\n\r\n&gt; A narrowing conversion of a signed integer to an integral type T simply discards all but the n lowest order bits, where n is the number of bits used to represent type T. In addition to a possible loss of information about the magnitude of the numeric value, this may cause the sign of the resulting value to differ from the sign of the input value.\r\n\r\nFrom the second chapter, **assignments** with narrow conversions are allowed if the value is a **constant expression**.\r\n\r\n&gt;  In addition, if the expression is a constant expression (&#167;15.29) of type `byte`, short, char, or int:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; A narrowing primitive conversion may be used if the variable is of type `byte`, short, or char, and the value of the constant expression is representable in the type of the variable.\r\n\r\nLong story short, a narrowing conversion that may lose information (because the value exceeds the range) has to explicitly be announced to Java. Java will not just do it for you without you forcing it. That is done by a cast.\r\n\r\nSo for example\r\n\r\n    byte byteValue = (byte) (500 / 2);\r\n\r\nresulting in the value `-6`.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n## Constant expression ##\r\n\r\nYour last example is very interesting:\r\n\r\n    int n1 = 4;\r\n    byte byteValue = n1/2;\r\n\r\nAlthough this does not exceed the range, Java still treats it as lossy narrowing conversion. Why is that the case?\r\n\r\nWell, Java can not ensure 100% that `n1` is not changed last second before `n1/2` is executed. Therefore, it would have to consider all of your code to see if maybe someone accesses `n1` sneaky and changes it. Java does not do this kind of analysis at compile-time.\r\n\r\nSo if you can tell Java that `n1` stays `4` and can actually never change, then this will actually compile. In this specific case, it would be enough to make it `final`. So with\r\n\r\n    final int n1 = 4;\r\n    byte byteValue = n1/2;\r\n\r\nit will actually compile because Java knows that `n1` stays `4` and can not change anymore.

If that happens, my suggestions, go for Docker (just get a close look on memory usage and make sure to limit them on your container(s)).\r\n\r\n3) Start very small, replace functionalities related to creating new stuff which hold little to no logic (small crud, such as users, etc) then move to things that have mid-sized logic or that are really ugly on the legacy product and are used on day-to-day basis by your end-users.\r\n\r\n4) All of the rest (by the time I left the company, we were not in this phase yet, so I can&#39;t provide much info on that).\r\n\r\n5) Don&#39;t treat this project as a migration only.

Old code should not be copied and pasted, it should be understood and improved using best practices. \r\n\r\n5.1) Unit and integration tests as soon as possible, if your legacy have them, GREAT, compare results to make sure your refactoring didn&#39;t break anything or changed the expected outputs. THIS IS ESSENTIAL.\r\n\r\n*Front-end*\r\n\r\n1) Once you have the &quot;unified&quot; login working, you will be able to load the pages from the new product as if they were part of the legacy (you could even add a frame on the jsp of the legacy that will load your angular page, we did it and it works like a charm). \r\n\r\n1.1) Not cute from a UI/UX perspective to have old and new pages, but it will add value to end-user and provide you with feedback from them once you release the pieces to production.

The sooner you figure out things such as colors, design, icons, etc, the less time you will waste on meetings that should discuss the release and its impact but are wasted discussing &quot;this is not the color I wanted&quot; or similar.

Also, a SimpleStreamingClientHttpRequest is not a StreamingHttpOutputMessage while HttpComponentsStreamingClientHttpRequest is in fact.\r\n\r\nJust a last note: the way I found out it is not streaming at all is because I had to send a file of more than 2.2 GB, which is basically the limit of a byte array in Java because its length can only be MAX_INT long.

I&#39;ve recently encountered a situation related to in-app purchases and access to purchased content.\r\n\r\nThe scenario is as follows: After successfully completing a purchase, I&#39;m facing difficulties in granting users access to the purchased content. I&#39;ve verified that the SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) are correctly set up, and the Firebase connections seem to be in order as well.\r\n\r\nGiven that the purchase process is successfully concluding, the challenge seems to lie in delivering the appropriate content associated with the purchased SKU. I&#39;ve ensured that the SKU values match both in the code and on the Google Play Developer Console. Additionally, I&#39;ve double-checked the configuration of Firebase connections to ensure accuracy.\r\n\r\nIf you have any insights or suggestions on how to address this issue, I would greatly appreciate your assistance.

I've recently encountered a situation related to in-app purchases and access to purchased content.</p>\n<p>The scenario is as follows: After successfully completing a purchase, I'm facing difficulties in granting users access to the purchased content. I've verified that the SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) are correctly set up, and the Firebase connections seem to be in order as well.</p>\n<p>Given that the purchase process is successfully concluding, the challenge seems to lie in delivering the appropriate content associated with the purchased SKU. I've ensured that the SKU values match both in the code and on the Google Play Developer Console. Additionally, I've double-checked the configuration of Firebase connections to ensure accuracy.</p>\n<p>If you have any insights or suggestions on how to address this issue, I would greatly appreciate your assistance.

Also, to compare hand-written asm against Java, you&#39;d have to run a JVM on the same MIPS CPU, so MARS/SPIM aren&#39;t options for that."},{"owner":{"account_id":78868,"reputation":336965,"user_id":224132,"accept_rate":83,"display_name":"Peter Cordes"},"score":0,"creation_date":1691886124,"post_id":76891544,"comment_id":135551743,"body_markdown":"QEMU can emulate a full-system MIPS CPU, but it&#39;s not a cycle-accurate simulator.

August 2018 [Amazon announced](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/08/use-amazon-dynamodb-local-more-easily-with-the-new-docker-image/) new [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/dynamodb-local/) with Amazon DynamoDB Local onboard. It does not require downloading and running any JARs as well as adding using third-party OS-specific binaries like `sqlite4java`.\r\n\r\nIt is as simple as starting a Docker container before the tests:\r\n\r\n    docker run -p 8000:8000 amazon/dynamodb-local\r\n\r\nYou can do that manually for local development, as described above, or use it in your CI pipeline. Many CI services provide an ability to start additional containers during the pipeline that can provide dependencies for your tests. Here is an example for Gitlab CI/CD:\r\n\r\n    test:\r\n      stage: test\r\n      image: openjdk:8-alpine\r\n      services:\r\n        - name: amazon/dynamodb-local\r\n          alias: dynamodb-local\r\n      script:\r\n        - ./gradlew clean test\r\n\r\nSo, during the `test` task DynamoDB will be available on `http://dynamodb-local:8000`.\r\n\r\nAnother, more powerful tool is [localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack). It supports two dozen of AWS services, DynamoDB is one of them.

would like to make a bottom navigation bar in my project. Every view has it&#39;s own fragment. The problem is that every time i click on the button to change the view for example from recents to favorites it creates new fragment with completely new states(e.g. scroll position, text changed whatever my fragment contains). I know that in official Android  documentation there was written that bottom navigation bar should reset the task states, but i think it is too uncomfortable for users.\r\nI would like to have kind of similar functionality like instagram that you change from feed to explore and back to feed the scroll position the image caches everything remains saved. I tried almost every way to solve this problem the only thing that worked is by setting visibility GONE and setting visibility VISIBLE according to situation but i understand that it is not RIGHT way there should be better way of doing this and i am not talking about manually saving needed instances. I followed almost every tutorial about bottom nav fragments but the interesting thing is that no one is interested to make it use without calling new every time.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description

them","body":"<p>I would like to make a bottom navigation bar in my project. Every view has it's own fragment. The problem is that every time i click on the button to change the view for example from recents to favorites it creates new fragment with completely new states(e.g. scroll position, text changed whatever my fragment contains). I know that in official Android  documentation there was written that bottom navigation bar should reset the task states, but i think it is too uncomfortable for users.\nI would like to have kind of similar functionality like instagram that you change from feed to explore and back to feed the scroll position the image caches everything remains saved. I tried almost every way to solve this problem the only thing that worked is by setting visibility GONE and setting visibility VISIBLE according to situation but i understand that it is not RIGHT way there should be better way of doing this and i am not talking about manually saving needed instances. I followed almost every tutorial about bottom nav fragments but the interesting thing is that no one is interested to make it use without calling new every time.</p>\n\n<p><a
