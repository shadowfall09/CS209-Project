That&#39;s generally a 64-bit value that tells the JVM where to find an object in the heap. __It is not the instance of whatTime itself that is stored in `wt`!__ - it is merely a __reference__ to it. Think: &quot;An page in an address book with the address of a house on it&quot;, not: &quot;A house&quot;. an instanceof `whatTime` is the house, `wt` is the address book page.\r\n\r\nOther threads cannot interact with the address book page - at best, you can make a copy of it, and hand the copy to another thread. But they can take their copy of the address book page, drive over there, toss a brick through the window. If later that day you also drive over there you will - see the damaged window.\r\n\r\n`new WhatTime()` - that &#39;builds&#39; the house, and assigns the __address__ of that house to the `wt` variable.\r\n\r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt; threadA ta = new threadA(wt);\r\n&gt; ```\r\n\r\nThis makes a new instance of `threadA` (and also notes the __adress__ of it onto the local variable space), and hands a copy of your address book page to it (java is pass-by-copy, always, but `wt` is the reference, not the object itself). You now have an address book page with &#39;123 Fairfield lane&#39; on it, and so does `threadA` - threadA has its own private copy. Whatever threadA does __with that address book page__ has no effect on your address book. But if they decide to go to the house at that address - you can see that too.\r\n\r\n&gt;  From my basic knowledge if a thread is in a while true loop you cannot interact with it\r\n\r\nWhere you say &#39;in a while true loop&#39;, what you really mean is &#39;if it is running&#39;. It doesn&#39;t matter if it is looping, it just matters that it is running.\r\n\r\nWhat this is referring to is the memory model. Modern CPUs cannot read or write memory __at all__. Because that memory bus is waaaay too far away, those electrons are flying through the lines on your motherboard at ~60% the speed of light or similar, and that means it&#39;s like slow molasses relative to the CPU, that&#39;s why they cannot do that. Instead, there is a small chunk of very fast memory directly on the core, split up in a few &#39;pages&#39; that have a set size (Something like 64k - depends on your processor), and the only thing a CPU can do is tell the memory controller: Go write this page back to main memory (all 64k of it) at this address, then wipe it out and replace it with the contents of the main memory banks from A to B. I&#39;ll wait. All 1000 cycles of it, because, boy, I need to wait a long time for you to do this stuff because that memory bank is so far away.\r\n\r\nGiven that that is how CPUs work, java needs to &#39;claim&#39; some rights because if it didn&#39;t it would run incredibly slowly. One of the rights it claims is reordering and local caching.\r\n\r\nA JVM __may__ cache anything you get from the heap (so any non-local) in the on-die cache of the CPU core. Which means if you have 1 field, and 2 threads are simultaneously reading and writing to that field, each thread __may__ actually just be writing to its local copy, and the JVM is non-specific as to how it will merge this back into memory - generally, some arbitrary page write &#39;wins&#39; and it&#39;s all unreliable.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if 2 threads are accessing the same bit of heap (the same field), your code is broken: Depending on the CPU, architecture, music playing on your music player as you do the operation, or the phase of the moon - you get one result or another. Ouch.\r\n\r\nTo make threading possible in the first place, the JMM (Java Memory Model) defines certain specific operations that establish &#39;Happens-Before&#39;. If according to the JMM action A &#39;happens before&#39; action B, then the B line, and any line that follows it, will not be able to observe state such as it was _before_ A ran. Essentially, If A &#39;Happens-Before (per the JMM)&#39; B, then A really does happen before B, _unless_ B couldn&#39;t possibly observe this, in which case the JVM is still free to run these things in whatever order it wants.\r\n\r\nEstablishing HB can be done with `synchronized`, `volatile`, various peculiar actions (`thread.start()` is HB relative to the first line inside that thread, for example), and of course by using (core) library functions that itself do this stuff, such as `ConcurrentHashMap` and many other things from the j.u.c package.\r\n\r\nThis is, presumably, what you read and misunderstood: You __should not__ interact (read or write) any field that another thread that has started and hasn&#39;t died yet also interacts with, __unless__ you have carefully managed this access and ensured that all possible interactions are probably guarded by HB/HA relationships so that your code will run the same way every time and didn&#39;t turn into some crazy evil coin flip game where it depends on the flaps of the proverbial butterfly. If you break the rule and you interact with the same field from 2 separate threads without establishing HB/HA anyway - then &#39;it works&#39; (nothing directly crashes, no exceptions are thrown, the code compiles fine, and will run) - but the results are more or less arbitrary:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Example {\r\n  int x;\r\n\r\n  void crazy() {\r\n    x = 1;\r\n    new Thread(() -&gt; x = 5).start();\r\n    new Thread(() -&gt; x = 10).start();\r\n    System.out.println(x);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code can legally print 1, 5, __or__ 10. A JVM is working properly and is fulfilling the spec __no matter which one of those it happens to return__ - and the JVM doesn&#39;t guarantee it&#39;s random either (a JVM that always returns 1 here, is fine. A JVM that always returns 1 except it returns 10 on the 5th monday of the 3rd month - is fine). Code written like this is the problem. There&#39;s no way to know, really. It&#39;s essentially impossible to test for it (given that a JVM that always returns 1 is also fine here). The vast majority of ways you can run this (combos of JVM vendor, version, OS, architecture, etc) will print &#39;1&#39;, but a &#39;10&#39; wouldn&#39;t be incorrect.\r\n\r\nHere in this specific code, there is no problem at all - `wt` the reference is written once, and this is HB relative to the thread (because it precedes `t.start()`), so accessing the ref isn&#39;t an issue as it never changes, and `System.currentTimeMillis()` doesn&#39;t access any fields, so the call to `.getTime()` isn&#39;t problematic either.\r\n\r\nHence, this code works.. just fine.

So let us get going,\r\nEverybody has their own ways to explain things, let me try to sum it up and simple it up for you in a few steps with an example;\r\nSuppose you have a simple form, `form.jsp`:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n    &lt;form:form action=&quot;processForm&quot; modelAttribute=&quot;student&quot;&gt;\r\n      First Name : &lt;form:input path=&quot;firstName&quot; /&gt; \r\n      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\r\n      Last Name : &lt;form:input path=&quot;lastName&quot; /&gt;\r\n      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\r\n      &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;submit&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/form:form&gt;\r\n\r\n`&lt;form:input path=&quot;firstName&quot; /&gt;` `&lt;form:input path=&quot;lastName&quot; /&gt;` These are the fields/properties in the Student class. When the form is called/initialized their getters are invoked. On form submit their setters are invoked, and their values are transferred in the bean that was indicated with `modelAttribute=&quot;student&quot;` in the form tag.\r\n\r\nWe have `StudentController` that includes the following methods:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-java --&gt;\r\n    @RequestMapping(&quot;/showForm&quot;)\r\n    // `Model` is used to pass data between controllers and views\r\n    public String showForm(Model theModel) {\r\n        // attribute name, value\r\n        theModel.addAttribute(&quot;student&quot;, new Student());\r\n        return &quot;form&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n       \r\n    @RequestMapping(&quot;/processForm&quot;)\r\n    public String processForm(@ModelAttribute(&quot;student&quot;) Student theStudent) {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;theStudent :&quot;+ theStudent.getLastName());\r\n        return &quot;form-details&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    //@ModelAttribute(&quot;student&quot;) Student theStudent\r\n    //Spring automatically populates the object data with form data \r\n    //all behind the scenes\r\n\r\nNow finally we have a `form-details.jsp`:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n    &lt;b&gt;Student Information&lt;/b&gt;\r\n    ${student.firstName}\r\n    ${student.lastName}\r\n\r\n\r\nSo back to the question What is `@ModelAttribute` in Spring MVC?\r\nA sample definition from the source for you,\r\n[http://www.baeldung.com/spring-mvc-and-the-modelattribute-annotation][1]\r\nThe `@ModelAttribute` is an annotation that binds a method parameter or method return value to a named model attribute and then exposes it to a web view.\r\n\r\nWhat actually happens is it gets all the values of your form those were submitted by it and then holds them for you to bind or assign them to the object. It works like the `@RequestParameter` where we only get a parameter and assign the value to some method argument. \r\nThe difference is that `@ModelAttribute` holds all form data rather than a single parameter. It creates a bean for you which holds the data submitted in the form.\r\n\r\nTo recap the whole thing:\r\n\r\nStep 1:&lt;br/&gt;\r\nA request is sent and our method `showForm()` runs and a model, a temporary bean, is set with the name `student` and forwarded to the form:&lt;br/&gt;\r\n`theModel.addAttribute(&quot;student&quot;, new Student());`\r\n\r\nStep 2:&lt;br/&gt;\r\nForm attribute `modelAttribute=&quot;student&quot;` defines that on form submission the model will update the student and will hold all parameters of the form.\r\n\r\nStep 3:&lt;br/&gt;\r\nOn form submission the `processForm()` method is invoked with parameter `@ModelAttribute(&quot;student&quot;) Student theStudent`: the values being hold in the form with `modelAttribute=&quot;student&quot;` were fetched and assigned to the fields in the `Student` object.\r\n\r\nStep 4:&lt;br/&gt;\r\nAnd then we use it as we bid, just like showing it on the page etc like I did\r\n\r\nI hope it helps you to understand the concept. Thanks\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.baeldung.com/spring-mvc-and-the-modelattribute-annotation","title":"What is @ModelAttribute in Spring MVC?","body":"<p>I know I am late to the party, but I'll quote like they say,\n&quot;better be late than never&quot;.

On form submit their setters are invoked, and their values are transferred in the bean that was indicated with <code>modelAttribute=&quot;student&quot;</code> in the form tag.</p>\n<p>We have <code>StudentController</code> that includes the following methods:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@RequestMapping(&quot;/showForm&quot;)\n// `Model` is used to pass data between controllers and views\npublic String showForm(Model theModel) {\n    // attribute name, value\n    theModel.addAttribute(&quot;student&quot;, new Student());\n    return &quot;form&quot;;\n}\n   \n@RequestMapping(&quot;/processForm&quot;)\npublic String processForm(@ModelAttribute(&quot;student&quot;) Student theStudent) {\n    System.out.println(&quot;theStudent :&quot;+ theStudent.getLastName());\n    return &quot;form-details&quot;;\n}\n\n//@ModelAttribute(&quot;student&quot;) Student theStudent\n//Spring automatically populates the object data with form data \n//all behind the scenes\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now finally we have a <code>form-details.jsp</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;b&gt;Student Information&lt;/b&gt;\n${student.firstName}\n${student.lastName}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So back to the question What is <code>@ModelAttribute</code> in Spring MVC?\nA sample definition from the source for you,\n<a href=\"http://www.baeldung.com/spring-mvc-and-the-modelattribute-annotation\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.baeldung.com/spring-mvc-and-the-modelattribute-annotation</a>\nThe <code>@ModelAttribute</code> is an annotation that binds a method parameter or method return value to a named model attribute and then exposes it to a web view.</p>\n<p>What actually happens is it gets all the values of your form those were submitted by it and then holds them for you to bind or assign them to the object. It works like the <code>@RequestParameter</code> where we only get a parameter and assign the value to some method argument.\nThe difference is that <code>@ModelAttribute</code> holds all form data rather than a single parameter. It creates a bean for you which holds the data submitted in the form.</p>\n<p>To recap the whole thing:</p>\n<p>Step 1:<br/>\nA request is sent and our method <code>showForm()</code> runs and a model, a temporary bean, is set with the name <code>student</code> and forwarded to the form:<br/>\n<code>theModel.addAttribute(&quot;student&quot;, new Student());</code></p>\n<p>Step 2:<br/>\nForm attribute <code>modelAttribute=&quot;student&quot;</code> defines that on form submission the model will update the student and will hold all parameters of the form.</p>\n<p>Step 3:<br/>\nOn form submission the <code>processForm()</code> method is invoked with parameter <code>@ModelAttribute(&quot;student&quot;) Student theStudent</code>: the values being hold in the form with <code>modelAttribute=&quot;student&quot;</code> were fetched and assigned to the fields in the <code>Student</code> object.</p>\n<p>Step 4:<br/>\nAnd then we use it as we bid, just like showing it on the page etc like I did</p>\n<p>I hope it helps you to understand the concept. Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":6754165,"reputation":19,"user_id":5203245,"display_name":"Ragu Venkatesan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1525195971,"creation_date":1525195971,"answer_id":50121060,"question_id":3423262,"body_markdown":"@ModelAttribute simply binds the value from jsp fields to Pojo calss to perform our logic in controller class.

This would mean that the reader might _not_ see the updates to `buffer` and might read an element as `null`.  If you are mutating `buffer` and then reading from it later, both should be holding in a `synchronized` block on the same object – you might as well lock on `buffer`.
