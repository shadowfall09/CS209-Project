To this sink I emit events asynchronously every 25ms from a dedicated thread. There are 3 subscribers A, B and C where B pretends to do some work through thread sleep. A and C use <code>subscribeOn</code> and B uses <code>publishOn</code> on dedicated schedulers.</p>\n<p>I have 5 questions about the behavior of the backpressure along with the schedulers and <code>publishOn</code> vs <code>subscribeOn</code>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>why subscribeOn for A and C doesn't have any effect and elements are published on the emitting thread?</li>\n<li>A and C stop receiving events at 257 where B is already at ~15, shouldn't A and C stop at around ~256+15=271 ?</li>\n<li>after i=512 emissions start to fail on FAIL_OVERFLOW; is it because both buffers (B's publishOn 256 a sink's 256) are full? it is not true as B at this point already processed ~29 events</li>\n<li>A and C start receiving events back again after B=192, why 192? also, they receive the events on the B's scheduler, why?</li>\n<li>changing B's <code>publishOn</code> to <code>subscribeOn</code> pushes back the emitting thread respecting the slowest consumer (B). <code>subscribeOn</code> has again no effect, why?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is the runnable code.

The classes were not well designed or implemented. Improvements were attempted, thus the deprecations you’ve found. Unfortunately the attempts at improvement largely failed. You should **avoid these classes** altogether. They are supplanted in Java 8 by new classes.\r\n\r\nProblems In Your Code\r\n==\r\n\r\nA java.util.Date has both a date and a time portion. You ignored the time portion in your code. So the Date class will take the beginning of the day as defined by your JVM’s default time zone and apply that time to the Date object. So the results of your code will vary depending on which machine it runs or which time zone is set. Probably not what you want.\r\n\r\nIf you want just the date, without the time portion, such as for a birth date, you may not want to use a `Date` object. You may want to store just a string of the date, in [ISO 8601][1] format of `YYYY-MM-DD`. Or use a [`LocalDate`][2] object from Joda-Time (see below).\r\n\r\nJoda-Time\r\n==\r\n\r\nFirst thing to learn in Java: **Avoid the notoriously troublesome java.util.Date &amp; java.util.Calendar classes** bundled with Java. \r\n\r\nAs correctly noted in [the answer by user3277382][3], use either [Joda-Time][4] or the new [java.time.* package][5] in Java 8.\r\n\r\nExample Code in Joda-Time 2.3\r\n--\r\n\r\n    DateTimeZone timeZoneNorway = DateTimeZone.forID( &quot;Europe/Oslo&quot; );\r\n    DateTime birthDateTime_InNorway = new DateTime( 1985, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1, timeZoneNorway );\r\n\r\n    DateTimeZone timeZoneNewYork = DateTimeZone.forID( &quot;America/New_York&quot; );\r\n    DateTime birthDateTime_InNewYork = birthDateTime_InNorway.toDateTime( timeZoneNewYork ); \r\n\r\n    DateTime birthDateTime_UtcGmt = birthDateTime_InNorway.toDateTime( DateTimeZone.UTC );\r\n\r\n    LocalDate birthDate = new LocalDate( 1985, 1, 1 );\r\n\r\nDump to console…\r\n\r\n    System.out.println( &quot;birthDateTime_InNorway: &quot; + birthDateTime_InNorway );\r\n    System.out.println( &quot;birthDateTime_InNewYork: &quot; + birthDateTime_InNewYork );\r\n    System.out.println( &quot;birthDateTime_UtcGmt: &quot; + birthDateTime_UtcGmt );\r\n    System.out.println( &quot;birthDate: &quot; + birthDate );\r\n\r\nWhen run…\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: none --&gt;\r\n\r\n    birthDateTime_InNorway: 1985-01-01T03:02:01.000+01:00\r\n    birthDateTime_InNewYork: 1984-12-31T21:02:01.000-05:00\r\n    birthDateTime_UtcGmt: 1985-01-01T02:02:01.000Z\r\n    birthDate: 1985-01-01\r\n\r\n# java.time\r\n\r\nIn this case the code for [java.time][6] is nearly identical to that of [Joda-Time][4]. \r\n\r\nWe get a time zone ([`ZoneId`][7]), and construct a date-time object assigned to that time zone ([`ZonedDateTime`][8]). Then using the [Immutable Objects][9] pattern, we create new date-times based on the old object’s same instant (count of nanoseconds since [epoch][10]) but assigned other time zone. Lastly we get a [`LocalDate`][11] which has no time-of-day nor time zone though notice the time zone applies when determining that date (a new day dawns earlier in [Oslo][12] than in [New York][13] for example).\r\n\r\n    ZoneId zoneId_Norway = ZoneId.of( &quot;Europe/Oslo&quot; );\r\n    ZonedDateTime zdt_Norway = ZonedDateTime.of( 1985 , 1 , 1 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 0 , zoneId_Norway );\r\n\r\n    ZoneId zoneId_NewYork = ZonedId.of( &quot;America/New_York&quot; );\r\n    ZonedDateTime zdt_NewYork = zdt_Norway.withZoneSameInstant( zoneId_NewYork );\r\n    \r\n    ZonedDateTime zdt_Utc = zdt_Norway.withZoneSameInstant( ZoneOffset.UTC );  // Or, next line is similar.\r\n    Instant instant = zdt_Norway.toInstant();  // Instant is always in UTC.\r\n\r\n    LocalDate localDate_Norway = zdt_Norway.toLocalDate();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n# About *java.time*\r\n\r\nThe [*java.time*](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/package-summary.html) framework is built into Java 8 and later.

was following a tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOox3CGarf8) on how to implement JWT authentication on Spring, and it all worked well, that is, until I had to implement the very same `InitUsers.java` shown in the video. \r\n\r\nThe problem I&#39;m getting is the following (inside `.role(Set.of(Role.ROLE_ADMIN, Role.ROLE_USER)` from `InitUsers.java`, which is shown further below): \r\n```none\r\nRequired type: Set&lt;management.relation.Role&gt;\r\nProvided:      Set&lt;[path].user.Role&gt;\r\nno instance(s) of type variable(s) exist so that Role conforms to Role inference variable E has incompatible bounds: equality constraints: Role lower bounds: Role\r\n```\r\nI&#39;m not too well versed in Java, so I&#39;m wondering how I can apply the necessary changes for the code to work, without breaking it and straying away from what is shown in the video. \r\n\r\nThe relevant implementations are below:\r\n`InitUsers.java`\r\n```java\r\nimport
