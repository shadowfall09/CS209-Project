Let&#39;s focus on the node removals.\r\n\r\nAs you have discovered, this algorithm will need to be able to step back to nodes that were already visited in order to still remove them if needed.  The problem is that when you have already walked to a next neighbor node, there is no more reference to the node you came from.\r\n\r\nAn intuitive way to solve this is to use recursion, such that the recursive call does the job for the nodes *after* the current head node, and then after the recursion comes back the head can be compared with the first node in the list that was returned. If the same, both nodes are removed.\r\n\r\nHere is how that would look:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    private Node recurRemove(Node head) {\r\n        if (head != null) {\r\n            head.next = recurRemove(head.next);\r\n            if (head.next != null &amp;&amp; head.next.value == head.value) {\r\n                head = head.next.next; // Remove a twin\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return head;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public int size() {\r\n        int count = 0;\r\n        for (Node curr = start; curr != null; curr = curr.next) {\r\n            count++;\r\n        }\r\n        return count;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public int remainingNodes() {\r\n        start = recurRemove(start);\r\n        return size();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis looks elegant in my humble opinion, but the downside is that it needs stack space, and that is limited. \r\n\r\nEven if you would use an explicit stack as local variable instead, it is a pity that the algorithm would have an auxiliary space complexity of O(&#119899;).\r\n\r\n## Solution with O(1) auxiliary space\r\n\r\nWe could make this work with O(1) auxiliary space by realising that the linked list itself can be used as a stack. This could be done with this algorithm:\r\n\r\n* Start a new list (as empty)\r\n* Keep taking nodes from the original list (making it shorter) and prepend those nodes one by one to that new list (as if it were a stack) until duplicate values are encountered. \r\n* When that happens there is one of the twin nodes already on the &quot;stack&quot;, while the second one is still the original (shortened) list. From that list remove pairs for as long as itself has twins at its start. Once that is done check if now the first remaining node still has the same value as the node already on the stack. If so pop the node from the stack and remove it from the original list as well. \r\n* Repeat this process until the original list is empty.\r\n* The &quot;stack&quot; is now the list we want to have but in reversed order.\r\n* To get the list back in its intended order, repeat the above steps once more. This time no more nodes will be removed, but the list will be reversed still, which is the intention.\r\n\r\nHere is an implementation:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public int reverseAndRemoveTwins() {\r\n        Node right = start;\r\n        start = null; // We will prepend unique values to this (stack)\r\n        int count = 0; // This time we will also keep a counter (size of stack)\r\n        \r\n        while (right != null) {\r\n            Node next = right.next;\r\n            if (start == null || start.value != right.value) {\r\n                // Move the right node to become the head of the left list (reversal!)\r\n                right.next = start;\r\n                start = right;\r\n                right = next;\r\n                count++;\r\n            } else {\r\n                // Remove all identical values at the right\r\n                boolean odd = false;\r\n                while (right != null &amp;&amp; start.value == right.value) {\r\n                    right = right.next;\r\n                    odd = !odd;\r\n                }\r\n                // ...and pop the one at the left too when an odd count was deleted\r\n                if (odd) {\r\n                     start = start.next;\r\n                     count--;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return count;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public int remainingNodes(){\r\n        reverseAndRemoveTwins(); // This also reverses the list\r\n        return reverseAndRemoveTwins(); // This reverses it back\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code seems less elegant, but if you care about memory efficiency it is the way to go.","title":"Remove consecutive nodes in Single-Linked List","body":"<p>First of all, I would set aside the <em>counting</em> of the remaining nodes after nodes have been removed, as that is a trivial exercise.

My question is this: is there any reason one would choose to set the max size of an array to a particular value? The ```cache``` data member has a number of elements equal to ```10*1024```, which seems to me that the ```cache``` data member is supposed to only store up to 10 KB (?) of elements, but I am really not sure.

When a node is expanded, its child states are then <code>put</code> into the <code>StateCache</code> datastructure, which is a stack as far as I can tell. My question is this: is there any reason one would choose to set the max size of an array to a particular value? The <code>cache</code> data member has a number of elements equal to <code>10*1024</code>, which seems to me that the <code>cache</code> data member is supposed to only store up to 10 KB (?) of elements, but I am really not sure.

If an incorrect guess is made (the guess does not appear in the array), a final score and the time it took are displayed. My problem is that after I input a value (re) and then enter another correct value (tire), the loop doesn't allow me to add another guess but exits the loop, and the score only gets updated to the first correct guess, not both.

A [fat jar](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19150811/what-is-a-fat-jar) is a single, executable jar file that contains all the necessary dependencies and resources needed to run the application.

If so much as one bit is added, removed, or moved from the document, on the bitwise level, then the hash of that file will be completely different. (Not always, but don't worry about that.)</p>\n\n<p>Since the driver for Excel is quite different from the driver that selenium uses, especially given compression and other alterations/optimizations that may be made to the file by selenium, then -- of course -- the hash is going to be different. </p>\n\n<p>My recommendations:\n  Firstly: Pull up the file in <code>diff</code> and find out what is different between those two files. It's almost (but not quite) axiomatic that if the hashes for two files are different, then those files are also different. </p>\n\n<p>Secondly: write a driver that compares the <strong>information</strong> in those spreadsheets to verify integrity (and you can take hashes of that information) of the document, rather than verifying the files on a bitwise level. </p>\n\n<p>I'd recommend exporting both as a CSV and go line by line and compare the two. </p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":8164473,"reputation":4175,"user_id":6147374,"accept_rate":70,"display_name":"Ibo"},"score":0,"creation_date":1537204944,"post_id":52372234,"comment_id":91690317,"body_markdown":"this does not provide an answer to the question and it is more of a comment and since you cannot comment yet you have to earn the privilege first by answering the question you know the answers 100% for sure","body":"this does not provide an answer to the question and it is more of a comment and since you cannot comment yet you have to earn the privilege first by answering the question you know the answers 100% for sure"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":10689557,"reputation":1,"user_id":10376151,"display_name":"Eli Hatch"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1537202044,"creation_date":1537202044,"answer_id":52372234,"question_id":12516044,"body_markdown":"Are you sure metadata is included in the hash?

MD5 hashing will, almost certainly, give you different results for files that differ in any way, even by a single bit. In the 10 years since the original question, MD5 hashes have been deprecated in favor of more cryptographic-secure hashes but they are still generally fine for the OP&#39;s use case -- validating the files on your local filesystem. Accidental collisions are one-in-several-hundred million, depending on input, and importantly, files that are very similar but not identical are more likely to have different hashes. In other words, crafting two files that have the same hash is actually difficult to do, and requires making very specific changes in many places throughout one of the files. If you don&#39;t trust MD5, you can use any flavor of SHA or other hashing algorithm and you&#39;ll get similar results.\r\n\r\nDeep dive into .XLSX:\r\n\r\nThe .xlsx format is just a .zip format under the hood. You can use the linux `unzip` utility to de-compress an .xlsx:\r\n```bash\r\nunzip file.xlsx -d dir/\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrevious responses suggest calculating a `diff` on the two files, but have not described the best way to do this. Well, once you have used `unzip` on the .xlsx file, you will then have a directory structure with the &quot;guts&quot; of your spreadsheet:\r\n```bash\r\ndir/\r\n    [Content_Types].xml\r\n    _rels/\r\n          .rels\r\n    xl/\r\n          workbook.xml\r\n          worksheets/\r\n                      sheet1.xml\r\n                      sheet2.xml\r\n                      sheet3.xml\r\n . . .\r\n```\r\nOnce you have done this two two different spreadsheets, say `file1.xlsx` expanded to `dir1/` and `file2.xlsx` expanded to `dir2/`, you can do a recursive diff on the two files:\r\n```bash\r\ndiff -rq dir1/ dir2/ # &lt;-- The -rq flags mean recursive, file-name-only\r\n```\r\nNote that, if what you really want to know is whether the two files have different _content_, then this command will answer the question. If there is no output from this command, then there is no difference in content between the directories. IE, there is no difference between the two original spreadsheets&#39; content.\r\n\r\nIf you are curious about the differences in the .xlsx files themselves, you can dig into the bits of the headers with the linux `xxd` utility:\r\n```bash\r\nxxd file1.xlsx | head -n1 # &lt;-- look at the first line (16 bytes)\r\n00000000: 504b 0304 1400 0000 0800 acab a354 7d3d  PK...........T}=\r\n\r\nxxd file2.xlsx | head -n1\r\n00000000: 504b 0304 1400 0000 0800 66ac a354 7d3d  PK........f..T}=\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe time-stamp shows up at in the sixth octet (In this example, `acab`, and `66ac` respectively.). The date is in the seventh octet (In this example, `a354` for both).\r\n\r\nKeep in mind than a .XLSX file is just a .ZIP file with a set of directories and files that follow Microsoft&#39;s standard zipped up inside of it. Each one of the contained files will have its own CRC-32 hash.\r\n\r\nThe eighth and ninth octets contains a CRC-32 hash that is generated by whatever zip utility generated the file. So, if you have the `xxd` utility handy, you can skip all the unzipping steps mentioned above and simply do:\r\n```bash\r\nxxd -s 14 -l 4 file1.xlsx\r\nxxd -s 14 -l 4 file2.xlsx\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith output that will look something like this:\r\n```bash\r\nxxd -s 14 -l 4 file1.xlsx\r\n0000000e: 7d3d 6d31                                }=m1\r\n\r\nxxd -s 14 -l 4 file2.xlsx\r\n0000000e: 7d3d 6d31                                }=m1\r\n```\r\nthus confirming that the two internal files have the same hashes (regardless of timestamp). This is a handy check for the very first file contained within the .ZIP (ie .XLSX).\r\n\r\nFor an exhaustive view of the CRC32 hashes of the contents of all of the files contained within the .XLSX archive, you can use the following algorithm (pseudocode):\r\n```\r\nbytes := &quot;504b0102&quot; as binary\r\n\r\nchunks_array := file_content split on bytes\r\n\r\ncrc32_hashes = []\r\n\r\ncrc32_hashes := \r\n  for each chunk in chunks_array starting at 1: // skip index 0\r\n    append substring(24, 8) of hex(chunk)  // 24 / 2 = 12 + 4 = offset 16\r\n```\r\nThe magic number `504b0102` at the top is the separator for the file summaries at the end of the .ZIP file, flipped for endian-ness.\r\n\r\nThe resulting `crc32_hashes` array contains the CRC-32 hashes of each of the files contained therein. Again, because of internal timestamp mechanisms and other implementation-specific metadata in the internal XMLs, the human-readable parts of a spreadsheet could be identical but the CRC-32 hashes different.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this is an inexpensive way to get a &quot;fingerprint&quot; of two Excel files to find out if they are in fact two copies of the exact same .XLSX. It&#39;s just string manipulation, which is much less time and processor intensive than re-hashing. It is relying on the hashing that was already done at the moment the .XLSX file was created.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)#Structure\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/users/1644214/alvonellos","title":"Why MD5 hash values are different for two excel files which appear the same","body":"<p>Old post, new perspective:</p>\n<p>TL;DR - The zip specification includes a timestamp.

Unfortunately, the private key variable was not initialized with my key value as the method was executed in the constructor of the superclass before making the initialization.</p>\n<p>Is it a missing feature or have I simply overlooked the option for using different keys in the SAML Java Toolkit?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","protected"],"owner":{"account_id":2838423,"reputation":4567,"user_id":2438518,"accept_rate":53,"display_name":"mrbela"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1675701667,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1675701376,"creation_date":1675701376,"question_id":75364105,"body_markdown":"How would you describe the very confusing difference between\r\n\r\n1) a protected **instance** member and\r\n2) a protected **static** member\r\n\r\nin Java?\r\n\r\n(A member can be either a *method* or a *variable*.)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding 1 (protected **instance** member):\r\n\r\n    package a;\r\n    \r\n    public class A {\r\n    \t\r\n    \tprotected void methodInstanceProtected() { };\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    package b;\r\n    \r\n    import a.A;\r\n    \r\n    public class B extends A {\r\n    \t\r\n    \tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\t// instance:\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tB b = new B();\r\n    \t\tb.methodInstanceProtected();

For example, <code>CWMDF0022W: An attempt to scan class file &quot;{0}&quot; in JAR file &quot;{1}&quot; failed with exception: &quot;{2}&quot;</code>.</p>\n<p>6 - Confirm the <code>ejb-jar.xml</code> file does not include <code>metadata-complete=&quot;true&quot;</code>. Granted, it sounds like you started without an <code>ejb-jar.xml</code> file, but WebSphere does support an option during application install to generate an <code>ejb-jar.xml</code> file and mark it <code>metadata-complete</code>. Ensure you do not use this option at least for troubleshooting purposes.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":123756,"reputation":4386,"user_id":318414,"accept_rate":95,"display_name":"simonalexander2005"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":202,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":75363787,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1675699576,"creation_date":1675676244,"question_id":75359554,"body_markdown":"I have six Java Scheduler classes, each with a different purpose but all coded in the same way.

This code is correct and should have worked:\r\n        \r\n        gdb.execSQL(&quot;INSERT INTO &quot; + gdbTabelle + &quot; VALUES(1, &#39;When did Germany reunify&#39;, 2131165395, &#39;03.10.1990&#39;, &#39;0&#39;)&quot;);\r\n\r\n    But I guess what happened is that you wrote multiple rows with the same row id and the wrong image resource id while debugging. And then you only read the first wrong row. Try clearing app data in settings or completely reinstalling it or deleting excess rows using execSQL or specifying your id as the primary key (that way the id will always be unique and result in row overwriting).\r\n\r\nAlso, I would suggest creating a separate class for work with DB by extending SQLiteOpenHelper, you can read android docs about that (https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/sqlite). And for reading column values it is better to use getInt with [getColumnIndex][2] and with column names stored in constants.

That library was exported as a .jar file via IntelliJ Idea&#39;s artifact generation and build (following the default steps and selecting &quot;From modules with dependencies&quot;). In order to use it in the node project, which is an Eclipse project, I go to that project&#39;s buildpath and add the Scala library via &quot;Add External Jars...&quot;.\r\nThis were the steps that I used some time ago when the Scala project was finished and I played around with how could that be used in a Java project. In that test, the library was imported perfectly and I could use the classes. \r\nHowever, I was having some troubles to be able to include the Scala code, so I made a very simple project using the NumberFormatter node example project for KNIME and a new Scala project via IntelliJ to test. That project has only one package, with one class (object) with one function, which formats the given number. Created a .jar from the project following the same above steps and then included it to the Java KNIME node project the same way. Package is detected correctly and I can use autocompletion to reach the scala object and call its function. However, when I launch KNIME from eclipse, the node will not excecute, raising the excepcion at eclipse&#39;s terminal:\r\n\r\n    Execute failed: apackage/Transformer java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: apackage/Transformer\r\n\r\napackage was the name of the test package and Trasnformer the name of the object.

In order to use it in the node project, which is an Eclipse project, I go to that project's buildpath and add the Scala library via &quot;Add External Jars...&quot;.\nThis were the steps that I used some time ago when the Scala project was finished and I played around with how could that be used in a Java project. In that test, the library was imported perfectly and I could use the classes.\nHowever, I was having some troubles to be able to include the Scala code, so I made a very simple project using the NumberFormatter node example project for KNIME and a new Scala project via IntelliJ to test. That project has only one package, with one class (object) with one function, which formats the given number. Created a .jar from the project following the same above steps and then included it to the Java KNIME node project the same way. Package is detected correctly and I can use autocompletion to reach the scala object and call its function. However, when I launch KNIME from eclipse, the node will not excecute, raising the excepcion at eclipse's terminal:</p>\n<pre><code>Execute failed: apackage/Transformer java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: apackage/Transformer\n</code></pre>\n<p>apackage was the name of the test package and Trasnformer the name of the object. The exception was caused by</p>\n<pre><code>java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: apackage.Transformer cannot be found by org.knime.examples.numberformatter_1.0.0.qualifier\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thinking that it could be an issue with KNIME, I created a raw java project with a Test class and included the tested Scala library to it, the result is that the package can be seen at import and autocompletion works in it (I can even autocomplete the objects name in the main method) but an error message on the import sentence is shown:</p>\n<pre><code>The package apackage is not accessible\n</code></pre>\n<p>and if I autocomplete the class name, it shows:</p>\n<pre><code>Transformer cannot be resolved\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've searched trough Eclipse and IntelliJ docs and seems like I'm following the correct steps but I can't make it work</p>\n<p>Edit, here's the output of jar tf Trasnformer.jar (the jar of the Scala project).
