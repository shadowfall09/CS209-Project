They are behaving a certain way. So let&#39;s focus on the operator == for our case here.\r\n\r\nHow operator == works. \r\n\r\nIt checks if 2 references that we compare point to the same instance in memory. Operator `==` will resolve to true only if those 2 references represent the same instance in memory.\r\n\r\nSo now let&#39;s consider the following example\r\n\r\n    public class Person {\r\n    \r\n          private Integer age;\r\n          private String name;\r\n        \r\n          ..getters, setters, constructors\r\n          }\r\n\r\nSo let&#39;s say that in your program you have built 2 Person objects on different places and you wish to compare them.\r\n\r\n    Person person1 = new Person(&quot;Mike&quot;, 34);\r\n    Person person2 = new Person(&quot;Mike&quot;, 34);\r\n    System.out.println ( person1 == person2 );  --&gt; will print false!\r\n\r\nThose 2 objects from business perspective look the same right? For JVM they are not the same. Since they are both created with `new` keyword those instances are located in different segments in memory. Therefore the operator == will return **false**\r\n\r\nBut if we can not override the == operator how can we say to JVM that we want those 2 objects to be treated as same. There comes the `.equals()` method in play.\r\n\r\nYou can override `equals()` to check if some objects have same values for specific fields to be considered equal.\r\n\r\nYou can select which fields you want to be compared. If we say that 2 Person objects will be the same if and only if they have the same age and same name, then the IDE will create something like the following for automatic generation of equals()\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n        public boolean equals(Object o) {\r\n            if (this == o) return true;\r\n            if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\r\n            Person person = (Person) o;\r\n            return age == person.age &amp;&amp;\r\n                    name.equals(person.name);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s go back to our previous example\r\n\r\n        Person person1 = new Person(&quot;Mike&quot;, 34);\r\n        Person person2 = new Person(&quot;Mike&quot;, 34);\r\n        System.out.println ( person1 == person2 );   --&gt; will print false!\r\n        System.out.println ( person1.equals(person2) );  --&gt; will print true!\r\n\r\nSo we can not overload == operator to compare objects the way we want but Java gave us another way, the `equals()` method, which we can override as we want.\r\n\r\n**Keep in mind** however, if we don&#39;t provide our custom version of `.equals()` (aka override) in our class then the predefined `.equals()` from Object class and `==` operator will behave exactly the same.\r\n\r\nDefault `equals()` method which is inherited from Object will check whether both compared instances are the same in memory!\r\n\r\n**Why we override `hashCode()` method**\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Data Structures in java like HashSet, HashMap store their elements based on a hash function which is applied on those elements. The hashing function is the `hashCode()`\r\n\r\nIf we have a choice of overriding `.equals()` method then we must also have a choice of overriding `hashCode()` method. There is a reason for that.\r\n\r\nDefault implementation of `hashCode()` which is inherited from Object considers all objects in memory unique!\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s get back to those hash data structures. There is a rule for those data structures.\r\n\r\n\r\nHashSet can not contain duplicate values and HashMap can not contain duplicate keys\r\n\r\n*HashSet is implemented with a HashMap behind the scenes where each value of a HashSet is stored as a key in a HashMap.*\r\n\r\nSo we have to understand how a HashMap works.\r\n\r\nIn a simple way a HashMap is a native array that has some buckets. Each bucket has a linkedList. In that linkedList our keys are stored. HashMap locates the correct linkedList for each key by applying `hashCode()` method and after that it iterates through all elements of that linkedList and applies `equals()` method on each of these elements to check if that element is already contained there. No duplicate keys are allowed.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nWhen we put something inside a HashMap, the key is stored in one of those linkedLists. In which linkedList that key will be stored is shown by the result of `hashCode()` method on that key. So if `key1.hashCode()` has as a result 4, then that key1 will be stored on the 4th bucket of the array, in the linkedList that exists there.\r\n\r\nBy default `hashCode()` method returns a different result for each different instance. If we have the default `equals()` which behaves like == which considers all instances in memory as different objects we don&#39;t have any problem.\r\n\r\nBut in our previous example we said we want Person instances to be considered equal if their ages and names match.\r\n\r\n        Person person1 = new Person(&quot;Mike&quot;, 34);\r\n        Person person2 = new Person(&quot;Mike&quot;, 34);\r\n        System.out.println ( person1.equals(person2) );  --&gt; will print true!\r\n\r\nNow let&#39;s create a map to store those instances as keys with some string as pair value\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n    Map&lt;Person, String&gt; map = new HashMap();\r\n    map.put(person1, &quot;1&quot;);\r\n    map.put(person2, &quot;2&quot;);\r\n\r\nIn Person class we have not overridden the `hashCode` method but we have overridden `equals` method.

They are behaving a certain way. So let's focus on the operator == for our case here.</p>\n<p>How operator == works.</p>\n<p>It checks if 2 references that we compare point to the same instance in memory. Operator <code>==</code> will resolve to true only if those 2 references represent the same instance in memory.</p>\n<p>So now let's consider the following example</p>\n<pre><code>public class Person {\n\n      private Integer age;\n      private String name;\n    \n      ..getters, setters, constructors\n      }\n</code></pre>\n<p>So let's say that in your program you have built 2 Person objects on different places and you wish to compare them.</p>\n<pre><code>Person person1 = new Person(&quot;Mike&quot;, 34);\nPerson person2 = new Person(&quot;Mike&quot;, 34);\nSystem.out.println ( person1 == person2 );  --&gt; will print false!\n</code></pre>\n<p>Those 2 objects from business perspective look the same right? For JVM they are not the same. Since they are both created with <code>new</code> keyword those instances are located in different segments in memory. Therefore the operator == will return <strong>false</strong></p>\n<p>But if we can not override the == operator how can we say to JVM that we want those 2 objects to be treated as same. There comes the <code>.equals()</code> method in play.</p>\n<p>You can override <code>equals()</code> to check if some objects have same values for specific fields to be considered equal.</p>\n<p>You can select which fields you want to be compared. If we say that 2 Person objects will be the same if and only if they have the same age and same name, then the IDE will create something like the following for automatic generation of equals()</p>\n<pre><code>@Override\n    public boolean equals(Object o) {\n        if (this == o) return true;\n        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\n        Person person = (Person) o;\n        return age == person.age &amp;&amp;\n                name.equals(person.name);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's go back to our previous example</p>\n<pre><code>    Person person1 = new Person(&quot;Mike&quot;, 34);\n    Person person2 = new Person(&quot;Mike&quot;, 34);\n    System.out.println ( person1 == person2 );   --&gt; will print false!\n    System.out.println ( person1.equals(person2) );  --&gt; will print true!\n</code></pre>\n<p>So we can not overload == operator to compare objects the way we want but Java gave us another way, the <code>equals()</code> method, which we can override as we want.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep in mind</strong> however, if we don't provide our custom version of <code>.equals()</code> (aka override) in our class then the predefined <code>.equals()</code> from Object class and <code>==</code> operator will behave exactly the same.</p>\n<p>Default <code>equals()</code> method which is inherited from Object will check whether both compared instances are the same in memory!</p>\n<p><strong>Why we override <code>hashCode()</code> method</strong></p>\n<p>Some Data Structures in java like HashSet, HashMap store their elements based on a hash function which is applied on those elements. The hashing function is the <code>hashCode()</code></p>\n<p>If we have a choice of overriding <code>.equals()</code> method then we must also have a choice of overriding <code>hashCode()</code> method. There is a reason for that.</p>\n<p>Default implementation of <code>hashCode()</code> which is inherited from Object considers all objects in memory unique!</p>\n<p>Let's get back to those hash data structures. There is a rule for those data structures.</p>\n<p>HashSet can not contain duplicate values and HashMap can not contain duplicate keys</p>\n<p><em>HashSet is implemented with a HashMap behind the scenes where each value of a HashSet is stored as a key in a HashMap.</em></p>\n<p>So we have to understand how a HashMap works.</p>\n<p>In a simple way a HashMap is a native array that has some buckets. Each bucket has a linkedList. In that linkedList our keys are stored. HashMap locates the correct linkedList for each key by applying <code>hashCode()</code> method and after that it iterates through all elements of that linkedList and applies <code>equals()</code> method on each of these elements to check if that element is already contained there. No duplicate keys are allowed.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aMwel.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aMwel.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>When we put something inside a HashMap, the key is stored in one of those linkedLists. In which linkedList that key will be stored is shown by the result of <code>hashCode()</code> method on that key. So if <code>key1.hashCode()</code> has as a result 4, then that key1 will be stored on the 4th bucket of the array, in the linkedList that exists there.</p>\n<p>By default <code>hashCode()</code> method returns a different result for each different instance. If we have the default <code>equals()</code> which behaves like == which considers all instances in memory as different objects we don't have any problem.</p>\n<p>But in our previous example we said we want Person instances to be considered equal if their ages and names match.</p>\n<pre><code>    Person person1 = new Person(&quot;Mike&quot;, 34);\n    Person person2 = new Person(&quot;Mike&quot;, 34);\n    System.out.println ( person1.equals(person2) );  --&gt; will print true!\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now let's create a map to store those instances as keys with some string as pair value</p>\n<pre><code>Map&lt;Person, String&gt; map = new HashMap();\nmap.put(person1, &quot;1&quot;);\nmap.put(person2, &quot;2&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>In Person class we have not overridden the <code>hashCode</code> method but we have overridden <code>equals</code> method. Since the default <code>hashCode</code> provides different results for different java instances <code>person1.hashCode()</code> and <code>person2.hashCode()</code> have big chances of having different results.</p>\n<p>Our map might end with those persons in different linkedLists.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TOSNY.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TOSNY.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is against the logic of a HashMap</p>\n<p><strong>A HashMap is not allowed to have multiple equal keys!</strong></p>\n<p>But ours now has and the reason is that the default <code>hashCode()</code> which was inherited from Object Class was not enough.

This will replace all generated occurances of the <code>GeneratedFileImportInput</code> with your version.</p>\n<p>You can also take it a step further by adding the <code>GeneratedFileImportInput</code> to your <code>.openapi-generator-ignore</code> to ensure the file isn't generated at all.</p>\n<p>By doing this, you can ensure any clients of your REST API that are using the swagger ui (or any other ui) can see the schema as a part of your documentation without impacting your code base.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":4828788,"reputation":427,"user_id":3897533,"accept_rate":37,"display_name":"user3897533"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":1145,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1678796984,"creation_date":1678680592,"question_id":75717977,"body_markdown":"I have the following API input class\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\n@JsonTypeInfo(use = Id.NAME, include = As.PROPERTY, property = &quot;importType&quot;, visible = true)\r\n@JsonSubTypes({@Type(value = MriImportRequest.class, name = &quot;MRI&quot;)})\r\n@Schema(\r\n    description = &quot;Entity&quot;,\r\n    discriminatorProperty = &quot;importType&quot;,\r\n    discriminatorMapping = {@DiscriminatorMapping(schema = MriImportRequest.class, value = &quot;MRI&quot;)})\r\npublic abstract class FileImportInput {\r\n\r\n  @Schema(\r\n      type = &quot;ImportType&quot;,\r\n      example = &quot;MRI&quot;,\r\n      required = true,\r\n      description = &quot;The `type` attribute identifies the type of import like MRI&quot;)\r\n  @NotNull\r\n  private ImportType importType;\r\n\r\n  @NotNull\r\n  @NotEmpty\r\n  @JsonProperty(&quot;resourceUri&quot;)\r\n  @Schema(\r\n      type = &quot;string&quot;,\r\n      example = &quot;riskdata/v1/exposuresets/es1/1223/portfolios/12&quot;,\r\n      description = &quot;Resource identification string&quot;,\r\n      required = true)\r\n  private String resourceUri;\r\n\r\n  public ImportType getImportType() {\r\n    return importType;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public void setImportType(ImportType importType) {\r\n    this.importType = importType;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public String getResourceUri() {\r\n    return resourceUri;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public void setResourceUri(String resourceUri) {\r\n    this.resourceUri = resourceUri;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on import type value I have defined this MriImportRequest class\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\n@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)\r\n@JsonTypeName(&quot;MRI&quot;)\r\npublic class MriImportRequest extends FileImportInput {\r\n\r\n  @Schema(\r\n      type = &quot;MriImportSettings&quot;,\r\n      example = &quot;{ \\&quot;geohaz\\&quot;:true}&quot;,\r\n      description = &quot;Contains all settings&quot;)\r\n  @JsonProperty(&quot;settings&quot;)\r\n  private MriImportSettings settings;\r\n\r\n  public MriImportSettings getSettings() {\r\n    return settings;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public void setSettings(MriImportSettings settings) {\r\n    this.settings = settings;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have the following entry in POM for swagger code gen.\r\n \r\n```lang-xml\r\n&lt;plugin&gt;\r\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;swagger-codegen-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    &lt;executions&gt;\r\n        &lt;execution&gt;\r\n            &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n                &lt;apiPackage&gt;com.rms.sdk.api&lt;/apiPackage&gt;\r\n                &lt;generateApiTests&gt;false&lt;/generateApiTests&gt;\r\n                &lt;inputSpec&gt;${project.build.directory}/generated-resources/openapi.yaml&lt;/inputSpec&gt;\r\n                &lt;invokerPackage&gt;com.rms.sdk.invoker&lt;/invokerPackage&gt;\r\n                &lt;language&gt;java&lt;/language&gt;\r\n                &lt;modelPackage&gt;com.rms.sdk.model&lt;/modelPackage&gt;\r\n            &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n            &lt;goals&gt;\r\n                &lt;goal&gt;generate&lt;/goal&gt;\r\n            &lt;/goals&gt;\r\n            &lt;phase&gt;generate-resources&lt;/phase&gt;\r\n        &lt;/execution&gt;\r\n    &lt;/executions&gt;\r\n    &lt;groupId&gt;io.swagger.codegen.v3&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    &lt;version&gt;${swagger.codegen.version}&lt;/version&gt;\r\n&lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the swagger generated class I get the following error.
