This addresses the design principle of [separation of concerns][7]. The `Quiz` class is dedicated to *presenting* a quiz, not generating its content. The `QuestionsRepository` class is dedicated to retrieving a set of questions, not presenting to the user.\r\n\r\nAlso notice how we use `Collections.shuffle` to randomize the order of elements in our list of questions.

Also we&#39;ll try to review bloom filters and union operations you mentioned.\r\n\r\n# Let&#39;s consider some assumptions first\r\n\r\n - We&#39;re dealing with **unique** items within a single collection\r\n - Starting from here we will call our goal as finding the **intersections** of our collection\r\n - Namely our goal is to find all the **full intersections** with our collection. That means we want to find all the collections that contain **all values** of our collection\r\n - We&#39;re dealing with **Strings** as values\r\n - When comparing values, we are looking for **exact** match\r\n - We omit the details **HOW** we actually initialize our collections, this is out of the question scope. We consider only the way how do we search those intersections.\r\n - We&#39;re not implementing any low-level logic by our own. We&#39;re just using any existing library for these tasks, just focusing on principles.\r\n - The examples below are not &quot;best-written&quot; solutions. Those are just to demonstrate the ideas\r\n\r\nTo simplify code writing we&#39;ll use [Java Google Guava library][1]\r\n\r\nMaven `pom.xml` dependency to add to our project:\r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.guava/guava --&gt;\r\n    &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n        &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.guava&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;guava&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;version&gt;31.1-jre&lt;/version&gt;\r\n    &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving that said, let&#39;s take a look to different approaches:\r\n\r\n# Pretty straightforward way\r\n\r\nAs we&#39;re dealing with strings, in case if we have primarily quite long strings they could take too many space in RAM memory. But as long as we don&#39;t care about the actual values of these strings in our collections, we may use only hash codes of them. If our strings are primarily short, then there&#39;s no need to hash them, we can just use them as they are. \r\n\r\nLet&#39;s assume that our strings may be quite long (in real world, for example, URLs).\r\nWhat algorithm for hashing should we use? Well, it really depends, but the main goal is to achieve uniqueness to prevent collissions as much as possible. So in this example we&#39;ll use [SHA-256][2] hashing algorithm which gives 256-bit output.\r\n\r\nSo, the way we would search for intersections in this approach is the following:\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        // initialize the first set in which we&#39;ll perform searching\r\n        Set&lt;HashCode&gt; vegetables = Set.of(\r\n                hash256(&quot;tomato&quot;),\r\n                hash256(&quot;carrot&quot;),\r\n                hash256(&quot;broccoli&quot;)\r\n        );\r\n        // initialize the second set in which we&#39;ll perform searching\r\n        Set&lt;HashCode&gt; fruit = Set.of(\r\n                hash256(&quot;apple&quot;),\r\n                hash256(&quot;kiwi&quot;),\r\n                hash256(&quot;orange&quot;)\r\n        );\r\n        // collecting those collections to Map, where key = collection name, value = collection itself\r\n        Map&lt;String, Set&lt;HashCode&gt;&gt; targetMap = Map.of(&quot;vegetables&quot;, vegetables, &quot;fruit&quot;, fruit);\r\n\r\n        // initialize set for searching full intersections\r\n        Set&lt;HashCode&gt; search = Set.of(hash256(&quot;tomato&quot;), hash256(&quot;carrot&quot;));\r\n\r\n        // let&#39;s search\r\n        Set&lt;String&gt; intersections = targetMap.entrySet().stream()\r\n                // skip sets which size is lower than search set size\r\n                .filter(target -&gt; target.getValue().size() &gt;= search.size())\r\n                // check the rest sets with containsAll()\r\n                .filter(entry -&gt; entry.getValue().containsAll(search))\r\n                .map(Map.Entry::getKey).collect(Collectors.toSet());\r\n        // print names of sets which intersect with our search set\r\n        System.out.println(results);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // using Guava library to get 256-bit hash of string\r\n    public static HashCode hash256(String input) {\r\n        HashFunction hashFunction = Hashing.sha256();\r\n        return hashFunction.hashString(input, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote: while iterating through the sets we first skip all the sets which size is less than our search set, just for optimization sake. Obviously there&#39;s no sense to check those sets since it is guaranteed that they don&#39;t have enough elements for full intersection with our search set. Also, you can add `equals()` checking if you want to check whether the search set is the actual instance of the target set.\r\n\r\n# Using Bloom Filter\r\n\r\nA [Bloom filter][3] is a probabilistic data structure that is good for checking whether or not an element is definitely not in a set, but cannot tell you for sure whether something is in the set. A query returns either &quot;possibly in set&quot; or &quot;definitely not in set&quot;. A bloom filter doesn&#39;t store the elements themselves, this is the crucial point. You don&#39;t use a bloom filter to test if an element is present, you use it to test whether it&#39;s certainly not present, since it guarantees no false negatives. And it takes **significantly** less space comparing to a hash table/hash set and etc. and **speeds up** the checking.\r\n\r\nThe bloom filter works by taking the elements, running them through N different hash functions each with an accompanying bit vector, and then setting to True the position in the accompanying vector based on the hash observed. Once the position is flipped True (1), it is never set back to False (0).\r\n\r\nThe number of different hash functions N, as well as the length of the bit vectors, is usually reverse engineered in the implementation based on a configured capacity and maximum allowed error rate. Capacity is the number of distinct elements we expect to ever be seen by the bloom filter.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][4]][4]\r\n\r\nOf course, it has disadvantages:\r\n\r\n - Probabilistic in nature. It has false positive probability\r\n - Bloom filters add complexity. Complexity is more opportunity for things to go wrong\r\n - You should take care of cap of *expected insertions* since the overflowing a bloom filter with significantly more elements than specified, will result in its saturation, and a sharp deterioration of its false positive probability.\r\n - Cannot delete the inserted elements\r\n\r\nSo, using Guava library which has implementation of Bloom Filter we could write our code the following way:\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\r\n        // initialize the first set in which we&#39;ll perform searching\r\n        Set&lt;String&gt; vegetables = Set.of(&quot;tomato&quot;, &quot;carrot&quot;, &quot;broccoli&quot;);\r\n        // initialize the second set in which we&#39;ll perform searching\r\n        Set&lt;String&gt; fruit = Set.of(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;kiwi&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;);\r\n\r\n        // preparing our blooms.\r\n        // assign expectedAssertions for test = 100.\r\n        // assign fpp (the desired false positive probability) to 0.01 = 1%\r\n        int expectedAssertions = 100;\r\n        BloomFilter&lt;String&gt; vegetablesBloom = BloomFilter.create(\r\n                Funnels.stringFunnel(StandardCharsets.UTF_8), expectedAssertions, 0.01);\r\n        BloomFilter&lt;String&gt; fruitBloom = BloomFilter.create(\r\n                Funnels.stringFunnel(StandardCharsets.UTF_8), expectedAssertions, 0.01);\r\n\r\n        // put all the vegetables and fruits to blooms\r\n        vegetables.forEach(vegetablesBloom::put);\r\n        fruit.forEach(fruitBloom::put);\r\n        // collecting those blooms to Map, where key = bloom name, value = bloom itself\r\n        Map&lt;String, BloomFilter&lt;String&gt;&gt; targetMap =\r\n                Map.of(&quot;vegetables&quot;, vegetablesBloom, &quot;fruit&quot;, fruitBloom);\r\n\r\n        // initialize set for searching full intersections\r\n        Set&lt;String&gt; search = Set.of(&quot;tomato&quot;, &quot;carrot&quot;);\r\n\r\n        Set&lt;String&gt; results = targetMap.entrySet().stream()\r\n                // skip blooms which size is lower than search set size\r\n                .filter(entry -&gt; entry.getValue().approximateElementCount() &gt;= search.size())\r\n                .filter(entry -&gt; intersect(search, entry.getValue()))\r\n                .map(Map.Entry::getKey).collect(Collectors.toSet());\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(results);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // check intersection of our search set with bloom\r\n    public static boolean intersect(Set&lt;String&gt; search, BloomFilter&lt;String&gt; bloomFilter) {\r\n        for (String value : search) {\r\n            // return false immediately if this is definitely not the case.\r\n            if (!bloomFilter.mightContain(value)) {\r\n                return false;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return true;\r\n    } \r\n\r\nPay attention to `expectedAssertions` parameter. This is `fpp` - the desired false positive probability (must be positive and less than 1.0). Our bloom is more accurate the less value we provide, however, the more it accurate, the more memory our bloom takes.\r\n \r\nHere we&#39;re iterating through our **blooms** checking each element from our search collection in it with `mightContain(value)` if it says `false`, then we&#39;re sure this is not the case, this bloom is not intersected with our set.\r\n\r\n# Intersection with Union operation on Bloom Filter\r\n\r\nIn the previous approach we were checking each element of our search collection with bloom filter. One operation you can do with two bloom filters is union them, which means that if you have a bloom filter A and bloom filter B, you end up with a third bloom filter C that contains all the unique items from both A and B. How you union two bloom filters is you just do a bitwise OR on every bit in A and B to get the bits for C. Simple and fast to calculate.\r\n\r\nBut by itself this operation cannot be useful in our case. However, we can use it to perform the intersection checking. How can we achieve this?\r\n\r\nWell, there&#39;s some math included:\r\n\r\n&gt; Count(Intersection(A,B)) = (Count(A) + Count(B)) – Count(Union(A,B))\r\n\r\nHaving that said, let&#39;s try to perform this. \r\n\r\nChange the piece of code of previous approch to the following:\r\n\r\n    // prepare our search bloom\r\n    BloomFilter&lt;String&gt; searchBloom = BloomFilter.create(\r\n            Funnels.stringFunnel(StandardCharsets.UTF_8), expectedAssertions, 0.01);\r\n    search.forEach(searchBloom::put);\r\n\r\n    Set&lt;String&gt; results = targetMap.entrySet().stream()\r\n            // skip blooms which size is lower than search set size\r\n            .filter(entry -&gt; entry.getValue().approximateElementCount() &gt;= search.size())\r\n            .filter(entry -&gt; intersectWithUnion(searchBloom, entry.getValue()))\r\n            .map(Map.Entry::getKey).collect(Collectors.toSet());\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(results);\r\n\r\nAnd `intersectWithUnion()` method:\r\n\r\n    // check intersection of our search bloom with bloom\r\n    public static boolean intersectWithUnion(BloomFilter&lt;String&gt; searchBloom, BloomFilter&lt;String&gt; bloomFilter) {\r\n        long searchCount = searchBloom.approximateElementCount();\r\n        long targetCount = bloomFilter.approximateElementCount();\r\n        // making a copy of search bloom\r\n        BloomFilter&lt;String&gt; union = searchBloom.copy();\r\n        // perform union operation\r\n        union.putAll(bloomFilter);\r\n\r\n        // apply our formula\r\n        long intersectionFactor = (searchCount + targetCount) - union.approximateElementCount();\r\n        // if intersection factor is equal to initial search count, then we have full intersection\r\n        return intersectionFactor == searchCount;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere we creating a bloom from our search set first. Then check the intersection of each bloom with our new method. The union operation is implemented in Guava library with [putAll()][5] method. Why do we call `copy()` on our search bloom? Well, as docs of `putAll()` states:\r\n\r\n&gt; Combines this Bloom filter with another Bloom filter by performing a\r\n&gt; bitwise OR of the underlying data. The mutations happen to **this**\r\n&gt; instance. Callers must ensure the Bloom filters are appropriately\r\n&gt; sized to avoid saturating them.\r\n\r\nSo, `putAll()` mutates our bloom. This `copy()` is our overhead in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Important note:**\r\nTo perform union operation the blooms must be **compatible**. Basically they must have the same *expectedAssertions* and *fpp*. To be compatible there are requirements:\r\n\r\n 1. BloomFilters must have the same number of hash functions\r\n 2. BloomFilters must have the same size underlying bit arrays\r\n 3. BloomFilters must have equal strategies\r\n 4. BloomFilters must have equal funnels\r\n\r\nOtherwise `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown. \r\n\r\n# What approach should we use?\r\n\r\nWell, there&#39;s no direct answer to this question, as it really depends to a lot of factors in your real case. There&#39;s no &quot;always better&quot; or &quot;always performant&quot; cases. Bloom filters are very useful and very memory-cheap when dealing with **huge** amount of data, for example, millions and millions of strings. But it has it&#39;s own disadvantages.

Also we'll try to review bloom filters and union operations you mentioned.</p>\n<h1>Let's consider some assumptions first</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>We're dealing with <strong>unique</strong> items within a single collection</li>\n<li>Starting from here we will call our goal as finding the <strong>intersections</strong> of our collection</li>\n<li>Namely our goal is to find all the <strong>full intersections</strong> with our collection. That means we want to find all the collections that contain <strong>all values</strong> of our collection</li>\n<li>We're dealing with <strong>Strings</strong> as values</li>\n<li>When comparing values, we are looking for <strong>exact</strong> match</li>\n<li>We omit the details <strong>HOW</strong> we actually initialize our collections, this is out of the question scope. We consider only the way how do we search those intersections.</li>\n<li>We're not implementing any low-level logic by our own. We're just using any existing library for these tasks, just focusing on principles.</li>\n<li>The examples below are not &quot;best-written&quot; solutions. Those are just to demonstrate the ideas</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To simplify code writing we'll use <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Java Google Guava library</a></p>\n<p>Maven <code>pom.xml</code> dependency to add to our project:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.guava/guava --&gt;\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.guava&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;guava&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;31.1-jre&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Having that said, let's take a look to different approaches:</p>\n<h1>Pretty straightforward way</h1>\n<p>As we're dealing with strings, in case if we have primarily quite long strings they could take too many space in RAM memory. But as long as we don't care about the actual values of these strings in our collections, we may use only hash codes of them. If our strings are primarily short, then there's no need to hash them, we can just use them as they are.</p>\n<p>Let's assume that our strings may be quite long (in real world, for example, URLs).\nWhat algorithm for hashing should we use? Well, it really depends, but the main goal is to achieve uniqueness to prevent collissions as much as possible. So in this example we'll use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SHA-256</a> hashing algorithm which gives 256-bit output.</p>\n<p>So, the way we would search for intersections in this approach is the following:</p>\n<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {\n    // initialize the first set in which we'll perform searching\n    Set&lt;HashCode&gt; vegetables = Set.of(\n            hash256(&quot;tomato&quot;),\n            hash256(&quot;carrot&quot;),\n            hash256(&quot;broccoli&quot;)\n    );\n    // initialize the second set in which we'll perform searching\n    Set&lt;HashCode&gt; fruit = Set.of(\n            hash256(&quot;apple&quot;),\n            hash256(&quot;kiwi&quot;),\n            hash256(&quot;orange&quot;)\n    );\n    // collecting those collections to Map, where key = collection name, value = collection itself\n    Map&lt;String, Set&lt;HashCode&gt;&gt; targetMap = Map.of(&quot;vegetables&quot;, vegetables, &quot;fruit&quot;, fruit);\n\n    // initialize set for searching full intersections\n    Set&lt;HashCode&gt; search = Set.of(hash256(&quot;tomato&quot;), hash256(&quot;carrot&quot;));\n\n    // let's search\n    Set&lt;String&gt; intersections = targetMap.entrySet().stream()\n            // skip sets which size is lower than search set size\n            .filter(target -&gt; target.getValue().size() &gt;= search.size())\n            // check the rest sets with containsAll()\n            .filter(entry -&gt; entry.getValue().containsAll(search))\n            .map(Map.Entry::getKey).collect(Collectors.toSet());\n    // print names of sets which intersect with our search set\n    System.out.println(results);\n}\n\n// using Guava library to get 256-bit hash of string\npublic static HashCode hash256(String input) {\n    HashFunction hashFunction = Hashing.sha256();\n    return hashFunction.hashString(input, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: while iterating through the sets we first skip all the sets which size is less than our search set, just for optimization sake. Obviously there's no sense to check those sets since it is guaranteed that they don't have enough elements for full intersection with our search set. Also, you can add <code>equals()</code> checking if you want to check whether the search set is the actual instance of the target set.</p>\n<h1>Using Bloom Filter</h1>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bloom filter</a> is a probabilistic data structure that is good for checking whether or not an element is definitely not in a set, but cannot tell you for sure whether something is in the set. A query returns either &quot;possibly in set&quot; or &quot;definitely not in set&quot;. A bloom filter doesn't store the elements themselves, this is the crucial point. You don't use a bloom filter to test if an element is present, you use it to test whether it's certainly not present, since it guarantees no false negatives. And it takes <strong>significantly</strong> less space comparing to a hash table/hash set and etc. and <strong>speeds up</strong> the checking.</p>\n<p>The bloom filter works by taking the elements, running them through N different hash functions each with an accompanying bit vector, and then setting to True the position in the accompanying vector based on the hash observed. Once the position is flipped True (1), it is never set back to False (0).</p>\n<p>The number of different hash functions N, as well as the length of the bit vectors, is usually reverse engineered in the implementation based on a configured capacity and maximum allowed error rate. Capacity is the number of distinct elements we expect to ever be seen by the bloom filter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jmtUr.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jmtUr.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Of course, it has disadvantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Probabilistic in nature. It has false positive probability</li>\n<li>Bloom filters add complexity. Complexity is more opportunity for things to go wrong</li>\n<li>You should take care of cap of <em>expected insertions</em> since the overflowing a bloom filter with significantly more elements than specified, will result in its saturation, and a sharp deterioration of its false positive probability.</li>\n<li>Cannot delete the inserted elements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, using Guava library which has implementation of Bloom Filter we could write our code the following way:</p>\n<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n    // initialize the first set in which we'll perform searching\n    Set&lt;String&gt; vegetables = Set.of(&quot;tomato&quot;, &quot;carrot&quot;, &quot;broccoli&quot;);\n    // initialize the second set in which we'll perform searching\n    Set&lt;String&gt; fruit = Set.of(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;kiwi&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;);\n\n    // preparing our blooms.\n    // assign expectedAssertions for test = 100.\n    // assign fpp (the desired false positive probability) to 0.01 = 1%\n    int expectedAssertions = 100;\n    BloomFilter&lt;String&gt; vegetablesBloom = BloomFilter.create(\n            Funnels.stringFunnel(StandardCharsets.UTF_8), expectedAssertions, 0.01);\n    BloomFilter&lt;String&gt; fruitBloom = BloomFilter.create(\n            Funnels.stringFunnel(StandardCharsets.UTF_8), expectedAssertions, 0.01);\n\n    // put all the vegetables and fruits to blooms\n    vegetables.forEach(vegetablesBloom::put);\n    fruit.forEach(fruitBloom::put);\n    // collecting those blooms to Map, where key = bloom name, value = bloom itself\n    Map&lt;String, BloomFilter&lt;String&gt;&gt; targetMap =\n            Map.of(&quot;vegetables&quot;, vegetablesBloom, &quot;fruit&quot;, fruitBloom);\n\n    // initialize set for searching full intersections\n    Set&lt;String&gt; search = Set.of(&quot;tomato&quot;, &quot;carrot&quot;);\n\n    Set&lt;String&gt; results = targetMap.entrySet().stream()\n            // skip blooms which size is lower than search set size\n            .filter(entry -&gt; entry.getValue().approximateElementCount() &gt;= search.size())\n            .filter(entry -&gt; intersect(search, entry.getValue()))\n            .map(Map.Entry::getKey).collect(Collectors.toSet());\n\n    System.out.println(results);\n}\n\n// check intersection of our search set with bloom\npublic static boolean intersect(Set&lt;String&gt; search, BloomFilter&lt;String&gt; bloomFilter) {\n    for (String value : search) {\n        // return false immediately if this is definitely not the case.\n        if (!bloomFilter.mightContain(value)) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n} \n</code></pre>\n<p>Pay attention to <code>expectedAssertions</code> parameter. This is <code>fpp</code> - the desired false positive probability (must be positive and less than 1.0). Our bloom is more accurate the less value we provide, however, the more it accurate, the more memory our bloom takes.</p>\n<p>Here we're iterating through our <strong>blooms</strong> checking each element from our search collection in it with <code>mightContain(value)</code> if it says <code>false</code>, then we're sure this is not the case, this bloom is not intersected with our set.</p>\n<h1>Intersection with Union operation on Bloom Filter</h1>\n<p>In the previous approach we were checking each element of our search collection with bloom filter. One operation you can do with two bloom filters is union them, which means that if you have a bloom filter A and bloom filter B, you end up with a third bloom filter C that contains all the unique items from both A and B. How you union two bloom filters is you just do a bitwise OR on every bit in A and B to get the bits for C. Simple and fast to calculate.</p>\n<p>But by itself this operation cannot be useful in our case. However, we can use it to perform the intersection checking. How can we achieve this?</p>\n<p>Well, there's some math included:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Count(Intersection(A,B)) = (Count(A) + Count(B)) – Count(Union(A,B))</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Having that said, let's try to perform this.</p>\n<p>Change the piece of code of previous approch to the following:</p>\n<pre><code>// prepare our search bloom\nBloomFilter&lt;String&gt; searchBloom = BloomFilter.create(\n        Funnels.stringFunnel(StandardCharsets.UTF_8), expectedAssertions, 0.01);\nsearch.forEach(searchBloom::put);\n\nSet&lt;String&gt; results = targetMap.entrySet().stream()\n        // skip blooms which size is lower than search set size\n        .filter(entry -&gt; entry.getValue().approximateElementCount() &gt;= search.size())\n        .filter(entry -&gt; intersectWithUnion(searchBloom, entry.getValue()))\n        .map(Map.Entry::getKey).collect(Collectors.toSet());\n\nSystem.out.println(results);\n</code></pre>\n<p>And <code>intersectWithUnion()</code> method:</p>\n<pre><code>// check intersection of our search bloom with bloom\npublic static boolean intersectWithUnion(BloomFilter&lt;String&gt; searchBloom, BloomFilter&lt;String&gt; bloomFilter) {\n    long searchCount = searchBloom.approximateElementCount();\n    long targetCount = bloomFilter.approximateElementCount();\n    // making a copy of search bloom\n    BloomFilter&lt;String&gt; union = searchBloom.copy();\n    // perform union operation\n    union.putAll(bloomFilter);\n\n    // apply our formula\n    long intersectionFactor = (searchCount + targetCount) - union.approximateElementCount();\n    // if intersection factor is equal to initial search count, then we have full intersection\n    return intersectionFactor == searchCount;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we creating a bloom from our search set first. Then check the intersection of each bloom with our new method. The union operation is implemented in Guava library with <a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/18.0/api/docs/com/google/common/hash/BloomFilter.html#putAll(com.google.common.hash.BloomFilter)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">putAll()</a> method. Why do we call <code>copy()</code> on our search bloom? Well, as docs of <code>putAll()</code> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Combines this Bloom filter with another Bloom filter by performing a\nbitwise OR of the underlying data. The mutations happen to <strong>this</strong>\ninstance. Callers must ensure the Bloom filters are appropriately\nsized to avoid saturating them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, <code>putAll()</code> mutates our bloom. This <code>copy()</code> is our overhead in this case.</p>\n<p><strong>Important note:</strong>\nTo perform union operation the blooms must be <strong>compatible</strong>. Basically they must have the same <em>expectedAssertions</em> and <em>fpp</em>. To be compatible there are requirements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>BloomFilters must have the same number of hash functions</li>\n<li>BloomFilters must have the same size underlying bit arrays</li>\n<li>BloomFilters must have equal strategies</li>\n<li>BloomFilters must have equal funnels</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Otherwise <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> will be thrown.</p>\n<h1>What approach should we use?</h1>\n<p>Well, there's no direct answer to this question, as it really depends to a lot of factors in your real case. There's no &quot;always better&quot; or &quot;always performant&quot; cases. Bloom filters are very useful and very memory-cheap when dealing with <strong>huge</strong> amount of data, for example, millions and millions of strings. But it has it's own disadvantages. In simple cases where you have not so much data it is definitely better to use some straight approach.
