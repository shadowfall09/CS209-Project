However, `DroolsConstraintStreamScoreDirectorFactory` calls `generateAndSetInMemoryANC`, which forces in-memory compilation. This might be the same question as [DROOLS-5990][4]\r\n 3.

I reviewed this here <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/94977/why-arent-variables-declared-in-try-in-scope-in-catch-or-finally\">try/catch scope in Java/C#</a>.</p>\n<p>Declaring t before the try-catch-block doesn´t work, as the syntax in <em>try</em> requires the variable to be declared right there.</p>\n<p>Is there any way that I can initialize <em>t</em> like this, and still make sure that the transaction gets closed / rollbacked? Or should I just begin the transaction before the try/catch-block?</p>\n<p>EDIT: Transaction is an 'AutoClosable'. Does this mean I don't need to explicitly handle rollback and closing?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","vb.net","selenium","automated-tests"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":4027328,"reputation":83,"user_id":3314976,"display_name":"DasunB"},"score":0,"creation_date":1447932851,"post_id":33802665,"comment_id":55370921,"body_markdown":"Robert : Is this happening at same line (after random number of executions in loop ) or is this occurs in different lines (different steps ) ?","body":"Robert : Is this happening at same line (after random number of executions in loop ) or is this occurs in different lines (different steps ) ?"},{"owner":{"account_id":4639283,"reputation":140,"user_id":3759604,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"Robert"},"score":0,"creation_date":1447933436,"post_id":33802665,"comment_id":55371364,"body_markdown":"The test should do this loop e.g 12 hours without any breaks.

NullPointerException error. I'm like a week searching for a solution, but nothing seems to work. I've already modified the &quot;unmarshallpacs008&quot; method and the &quot;SPIEnvelopeMessage&quot; class many times trying other stuffs that i've found over the forums.</p>\n<p>While debugging the code, i've seen that the error ocurrs at the &quot;unmarshaller.unmarshal&quot; point, where it returns null for all the 2 elements present at the &quot;SPIEnvelopeMessage&quot; class. They return literally as shown bellow but i've already changed the @XmlElement name and attributes and nothing works.</p>\n<p>appHdr = null\ndocument = null</p>\n<p>The point where the error is thrown is at &quot;message.getDocument()......&quot; bc there's no document, since it's returning null (line 94 from PSPEmissorService)</p>\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\"

So how should I go about this? DO I need to find a better algorithm for sorting the openlist or somehow divide the pathfinding tasks so that each tick only does X number of pathfinding tasks as opposed to all of them.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","json","csv","object","hashmap"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3983214,"reputation":4583,"user_id":3284624,"display_name":"D.B."},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1529815866,"creation_date":1529769827,"answer_id":51002850,"question_id":50996466,"body_markdown":"It&#39;s not quite clear from your question exactly how you want to handle your data when generating your tabbed output for certain scenarios, but I&#39;ll try to provide some sample code to help you.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, I want to say that it&#39;s not a good idea to serialize to JSON and then serialize JSON to tab separated values. You&#39;re doing 2 steps when you could be doing one, the JSON serialization doesn&#39;t get you any closer to your goal, and serialization is generally a costly process - you don&#39;t want to do it more than you have to.\r\n\r\nSo with that in mind here&#39;s a quick example of how you might implement a simple tab delimited serialization:\r\n\r\nSince you have at least one custom object to deal with inside of your `Params` class (referring to the `List` of `Aggregate`objects) I would suggest creating an interface that your classes can implement to indicate they are able to be serialized into a tab delimited string.\r\n\r\nI simply called this interface `TabSerializable`:\r\n    \r\n    public interface TabSerializable {\r\n    \tpublic String toTabbedString();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNext, I modified your `Params` class to implement this interface: \r\n\r\n    public class Params implements TabSerializable{\r\n    \t//fields omitted for brevity.\r\n        ...\r\n        \r\n        public String toTabbedString(){\r\n        \tStringJoiner joiner = new StringJoiner(&quot;\\t&quot;);\r\n        \t\r\n        \tTabSerializer.addValue(dataType, joiner);\r\n        \tTabSerializer.addValue(group, joiner);\r\n        \tTabSerializer.addValue(aggregates, joiner);\r\n        \tTabSerializer.addValue(scene, joiner);\r\n        \tTabSerializer.addValue(company, joiner);\r\n        \tTabSerializer.addValue(fit, joiner);\r\n        \tTabSerializer.addValue(params, joiner);\r\n        \tTabSerializer.addValue(tempo, joiner);\r\n        \tTabSerializer.addValue(id, joiner);\r\n        \tTabSerializer.addValue(valuation, joiner);\r\n        \t\r\n        \treturn joiner.toString();\r\n        }\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI also created a sample `Aggregate` class which also implements this interface: \r\n\r\n    public class Aggregate implements TabSerializable{\r\n    \tprivate String data;\r\n    \t\r\n    \t@Override\r\n    \tpublic String toTabbedString() {\r\n    \t\treturn data;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic String getData() {\r\n    \t\treturn data;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic void setData(String data) {\r\n    \t\tthis.data = data;\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSince you have mostly generic types of data structures like maps and lists I created the `TabSerializer` class to help transform those structures into tab delimited strings: \r\n\r\n    import java.util.List;\r\n    import java.util.Map;\r\n    import java.util.StringJoiner;\r\n    \r\n    public class TabSerializer {\r\n    \tprivate static void addValuesFromMap(Map&lt;?,?&gt; obj, StringJoiner joiner) {\r\n    \t\tfor(Object key: obj.keySet()){\r\n    \t\t\tObject value = obj.get(key);\r\n    \t\t\tif(value == null){\r\n    \t\t\t\tcontinue;\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\taddValue(key, joiner);\r\n    \t\t\taddValue(value, joiner);\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tprivate static void addValuesFromList(List&lt;?&gt; arr, StringJoiner joiner) {\r\n    \t\tfor(int i=0; i&lt;arr.size(); i++){\r\n    \t\t\tObject value = arr.get(i);\r\n    \t\t\taddValue(value, joiner);\t\t\t\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n        public static void addValue(Object value, StringJoiner joiner){\r\n    \t\tif(value == null){\r\n    \t\t\treturn;\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\tif(value instanceof List){\r\n    \t\t\taddValuesFromList((List&lt;?&gt;)value, joiner);\r\n    \t\t}else if(value instanceof Map){\r\n    \t\t\taddValuesFromMap((Map&lt;?,?&gt;)value, joiner);\r\n    \t\t}else if(value instanceof TabSerializable){\r\n    \t\t\tjoiner.add(((TabSerializable) value).toTabbedString());\r\n    \t\t}else{\r\n    \t\t\tjoiner.add(String.valueOf(value));\r\n    \t\t\t\t\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBased on the example you gave in your question I wrote the logic above to skip null values and the names of fields at the top level (those fields in the `Params` class).\r\n\r\nFinally I created a class with a `main` to test the above logic: \r\n\r\n    import java.util.ArrayList;\r\n    import java.util.HashMap;\r\n    import java.util.List;\r\n    import java.util.Map;\r\n    \r\n    public class MainTabDelim {\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    \t\tParams params = new Params();\r\n    \t\tparams.setDataType(&quot;abc&quot;);\r\n    \t\tList&lt;String&gt;

Things like `lombok.eclipse.HandleGetter`, which is the implementation for handling the `@Getter` annotation inside the eclipse agent. There is no point or purpose to referring to this class anywhere, in any project - it&#39;s an internal lombok thing. If we just stuck that jar file into the jar, and you typed `Handle` and hit your IDE&#39;s autocomplete shortcut key, you&#39;d still get the suggestion.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we ship a few dependencies straight into lombok.jar - it&#39;s a &#39;shaded jar&#39; (a jar with all deps included), though we don&#39;t have many, keeping `lombok.jar` a nice small size.

Also, prices are not always rounded to the nearest thousand, so if you want to carry out a search for an item based on say a price of 10000 (whatever denomination) then you will miss those items that are 10324, 10156.99, etc, etc. A range however of: 10000-10999 would most likely be a more viable option. Of course you can source this in code to automatically apply a range by providing an upper range value to the price supplied.
