I am writing this question here because I find the lack of resources a bit scary, when it comes to Spring Boot Java applications with Docker.\r\nMy goal is to create a fully featured warehouse management system as an example of good practices with Spring Boot, and as a learning experience for myself and others in many concepts of the framework.\r\n\r\nI am trying to create a Dockerfile so that my application can be run as a Docker image in a container, alongside a PostgreSQL database.\r\n\r\nThe application can be found [here on GitHub][1].\r\n\r\nThe `Dockerfile` of the application is :\r\n```\r\nFROM gradle:jdk17-alpine\r\nRUN mkdir /home/gradle/buildWorkspace\r\nCOPY . /home/gradle/buildWorkspace\r\n\r\nWORKDIR /home/gradle/buildWorkspace\r\nRUN ls /home/gradle/buildWorkspace\r\nRUN gradle build --no-daemon\r\nRUN ls /home/gradle/buildWorkspace/app/build/distributions/\r\nRUN tar -xvf /home/gradle/buildWorkspace/app/build/distributions/app.tar\r\nEXPOSE 8080\r\n```\r\n\r\nand `docker-compose.yaml`\r\n\r\n```\r\nversion: &#39;3.9&#39;\r\n\r\nservices:\r\n  db:\r\n    container_name: &quot;PostgresWarehouseDB&quot;\r\n    image: &quot;postgres:14.0-alpine&quot;\r\n    restart: always\r\n    environment:\r\n      POSTGRES_USER: warehouse_user\r\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: warehouse_user_password\r\n      POSTGRES_DB: warehouse_db\r\n    ports:\r\n      - &quot;5432:5432&quot;\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - &quot;./storage/migrations:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/&quot;\r\n  app:\r\n    container_name: &quot;SpringWarehouse&quot;\r\n    build:\r\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile\r\n      context: .\r\n    links:\r\n      - &quot;db:database&quot;\r\n    depends_on:\r\n      - db\r\n    ports:\r\n      - 8080:8080\r\n    command: /home/gradle/buildWorkspace/app/build/distributions/app/bin/app\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe `application.properties`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nspring.main.banner-mode=off\r\nlogging.level.org.springframework=ERROR\r\n\r\nspring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none\r\nspring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect\r\nspring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.lob.non_contextual_creation=true\r\n\r\nspring.datasource.initialization-mode=always\r\nspring.datasource.platform=postgres\r\nspring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/warehouse_db\r\nspring.datasource.username=warehouse_user\r\nspring.datasource.password=warehouse_user_password\r\n\r\n\r\n# Log JPA queries\r\n# Comment this in production\r\n# spring.jpa.show-sql=true\r\n\r\nspring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am using Java 17, Gradle 7 and latest dependencies.\r\n\r\nI have gotten as far as managing to build the application with Gradle and to start it up with `docker-compose up` alongside PostgreSQL (with an initial migration).\r\n\r\nMy issue is that somehow it seems to be unreachable via network, so my application cannot access the database, and thus does not function correctly.\r\n\r\nI get the following trace:\r\n```\r\nPostgresWarehouseDB | PostgreSQL init process complete;

It’s too easy to reproducibly see writes made by other threads as side effect of other, unrelated, reads and writes with stronger memory guarantees.\r\n\r\nFor example, in your case `thenCompose` checks the completion status of the future whereas the implementation specific caller of the function will change the completion status. This may appear to have the desired effect even when the status is “not completed” in which case there’s no formal *happens-before* relationship or when actually calling `thenApply` on the next chained future which also doesn’t establish a *happens-before* relationship as it’s a different variable.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it may appear to work with this JVM implementation without `volatile` but is not guaranteed, so you should never rely on such behavior.\r\n\r\nEven worse, your code is not guaranteed to work even with `volatile`.  \r\nThe basic shape of your code is\r\n```java\r\nCompletableFuture&lt;Integer&gt; result = …\r\n\r\nwhile (shouldKeepReading) {\r\n  result = result.thenCompose(…);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich implies that as long as the initial future is not already completed, this loop may chain an arbitrary number of dependent actions until the completion of the dependency chain manages to catch up. The system load caused by this loop may even prevent the chain from catching up, until encountering an `OutOfMemoryError`.\r\n\r\nAs long as the completion chain manages to catch up, you don’t notice a difference, as all chained actions evaluate to the same result, zero, as soon as `shouldKeepReading` became `false`.\r\n\r\nSince the original future originates from `promisesQueue.poll().get()` outside the scope, we may simulate a higher workload by inserting a small delay.

Since it requires the function itself to be chained via `thenCompose(this)`, the lambda has to be replaced by an anonymous inner class. If you don’t like this, you may resort to a recursive solution\r\n\r\n```java\r\nCompletableFuture&lt;Integer&gt; retryPoll() {\r\n    CompletableFuture&lt;Integer&gt; result = promisesQueue.poll().get();\r\n    return result.thenComposeAsync(res -&gt;\r\n        conditionPass(res)? CompletableFuture.completedFuture(0): retryPoll());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt’s remarkably simple here, as the retry doesn’t depend on the result of the previous evaluation (you’d need to introduce parameters otherwise), but on the changes `promisesQueue.poll().get()` makes to the program’s state.\r\n\r\nThis method uses `thenComposeAsync` to avoid deep recursions if there is a large number of already completed futures whose result is rejected by `conditionPass`. If you know for sure that `conditionPass` will succeed after a rather small amount of retries, you can change `thenComposeAsync` to `thenCompose`.\r\n","title":"Sequential call CompletableFutures","body":"<p>The HotSpot JVM is rather conservative.
