I already generated the abstract syntax tree and when entering the tree method, I can visualize what it generates, but I cannot establish the connection or initialization with the symbol table, since I need to meet the following requirements: The third installment of the final project consists of, given an input code, generating the tree of\r\nAbstract Syntax Tree (AST) and then traverse\r\nsaid AST in order to interpret it and carry out the pertinent actions.\r\nThe interpreter must be able to operate the if, while, and for control structures, as well as the\r\nvar and print statements. You must also evaluate arithmetic, relational, and logical operations.\r\n\r\nSymbol table:\r\nThe code of a class that corresponds to the symbol table was provided. The interpreter must\r\nbe able to manipulate said table, through the following actions:\r\n When, when traversing the AST, they come across a VAR node, it must go to the table of\r\nsymbols and register the variable that you are trying to define, if it already exists, it will be\r\nshould indicate so with an error message.\r\n If you try to make use of the value of a variable, you must first access the table of\r\nsymbols to verify that said variable exists, if it does not exist it must be indicated with\r\nan error message.\r\nThe symbol table must work &quot;globally&quot; for the entire program. imagine the\r\nfollowing situation: \r\n\r\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt; var a = 0;\r\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print a;\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous figure, two sentences were entered through the keyboard, in the first one the\r\nvariable a, which is entered into the symbol table. In the second statement, the table is accessed\r\nof symbols to retrieve the value of a.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried implementing singleton to make the symbol table global and be able to access it, but even so, when I want to print what the symbol table contains, it does not do so.","title":"How can I connect a Tree class to a Symbol Table class?","body":"<pre><code>import java.util.List;\n\n\n\npublic class Arbol {\n    private Nodo raiz;\n    private TablaDeSimbolos tablaDeSimbolos;\n\n    public Arbol(Nodo raiz) {\n        this.raiz = raiz;\n        \n    }\n    public void recorrer() {\n       \n        recorrerNodo(raiz);\n    }\n\nprivate void recorrerNodo(Nodo nodo) {\n    if (nodo.getValue() == null || nodo.getHijos() == null) {\n        return;\n    }\n\n        Token t = nodo.getValue();\n        switch (t.tipo) {\n            // Operadores aritméticos\n            case SUMA:\n            case RESTA:\n            case MULTIPLICACION:\n            case DIVISION:\n            case MAYOR_QUE:\n            case MENOR_QUE:\n            case MAYOR_IGUAL:\n            case MENOR_IGUAL:\n            case IGUAL_IGUAL:\n            case DIFERENTE:\n            case IGUAL:\n                SolverAritmetico solver = new SolverAritmetico(nodo, tablaDeSimbolos);\n                Object res = solver.resolver();\n                System.out.println(res);\n                break;\n\n            case VAR:\n                String nombreVariable = nodo.getHijos().get(0).getValue().literal.toString();\n                Token valorToken = nodo.getHijos().get(1).getValue();\n                Object valor = null;\n                if (valorToken.tipo == TipoToken.NUMERO) {\n                    valor = Double.parseDouble(valorToken.literal.toString());\n                } else if (valorToken.tipo == TipoToken.CADENA) {\n                    valor = valorToken.literal.toString();\n                }\n                tablaDeSimbolos.agregar(nombreVariable, valor);\n                break;\n\n            case PRINT:\n                Nodo identificadorNode = nodo.getHijos().get(0);

You must also evaluate arithmetic, relational, and logical operations.</p>\n<p>Symbol table:\nThe code of a class that corresponds to the symbol table was provided. The interpreter must\nbe able to manipulate said table, through the following actions:\n When, when traversing the AST, they come across a VAR node, it must go to the table of\nsymbols and register the variable that you are trying to define, if it already exists, it will be\nshould indicate so with an error message.\n If you try to make use of the value of a variable, you must first access the table of\nsymbols to verify that said variable exists, if it does not exist it must be indicated with\nan error message.\nThe symbol table must work &quot;globally&quot; for the entire program. imagine the\nfollowing situation:</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; var a = 0;\n&gt;&gt; print a;</p>\n<p>In the previous figure, two sentences were entered through the keyboard, in the first one the\nvariable a, which is entered into the symbol table. In the second statement, the table is accessed\nof symbols to retrieve the value of a.</p>\n<p>I tried implementing singleton to make the symbol table global and be able to access it, but even so, when I want to print what the symbol table contains, it does not do so.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","neo4j"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":13001928,"reputation":46,"user_id":9397755,"display_name":"Jennifer

Then through selection sort algorithm, sort the bits of Strings in the ArrayList and then print the longest possible palindrome, but for some reason it just doesn't print the desired output.</p>\n<p>Attaching the code below:</p>\n<pre><code>class Solution {\n\n    public boolean isPalindrome(String check)\n    {\n        String sum = &quot; &quot;;\n        for(int i=check.length()-1;i&gt;=0;i--)\n        {\n          sum = sum + check.charAt(i);\n        }\n        if(sum.equalsIgnoreCase(check)==true)\n        {\n            return true;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {\n       ArrayList&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();\n        String sum = &quot; &quot;;\n        for(int i=0;i&lt;s.length()-1;i++)\n        {\n          for(int j=i+1;j&lt;s.length();j++)\n          {\n               sum = s.substring(i,j+1);\n          \n          if(isPalindrome(sum)==true)\n          {\n              list.add(sum);\n              sum= &quot; &quot;;\n          }\n          else\n          {\n              sum=&quot; &quot;;\n              continue;\n          }\n          }\n        }\n\n        for(int i = 0;i&lt;list.size()-1;i++)\n        {\n            int minIndex=i;\n            for(int j=i+1;j&lt;list.size();j++)\n            {\n               if(list.get(j).length()&lt;list.get(minIndex).length())\n               {\n                   minIndex=j;\n               }\n            }\n            String temp = list.get(i);\n            list.add(i, list.get(minIndex));\n            list.add(minIndex, temp);\n        }\n\n        if(list.size()!=0)\n        {\n\n        \n        String get = list.get(list.size()-1);\n        return get;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            return null;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","sql","oracle","jdbc"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":22124137,"reputation":3297,"user_id":16376827,"display_name":"g00se"},"score":0,"creation_date":1628265442,"post_id":68684357,"comment_id":121382786,"body_markdown":"You actually can&#39;t use a set in a bind variable.

A short\n# synopsis follows.\n#\n# This file controls: which hosts are allowed to connect, how clients\n# are authenticated, which PostgreSQL user names they can use, which\n# databases they can access.  Records take one of these forms:\n#\n# local         DATABASE  USER  METHOD  [OPTIONS]\n# host          DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]\n# hostssl       DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]\n# hostnossl     DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]\n# hostgssenc    DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]\n# hostnogssenc  DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]\n#\n# (The uppercase items must be replaced by actual values.)\n#\n# The first field is the connection type:\n# - &quot;local&quot; is a Unix-domain socket\n# - &quot;host&quot; is a TCP/IP socket (encrypted or not)\n# - &quot;hostssl&quot; is a TCP/IP socket that is SSL-encrypted\n# - &quot;hostnossl&quot; is a TCP/IP socket that is not SSL-encrypted\n# - &quot;hostgssenc&quot; is a TCP/IP socket that is GSSAPI-encrypted\n# - &quot;hostnogssenc&quot; is a TCP/IP socket that is not GSSAPI-encrypted\n#\n# DATABASE can be &quot;all&quot;, &quot;sameuser&quot;, &quot;samerole&quot;, &quot;replication&quot;, a\n# database name, or a comma-separated list thereof. The &quot;all&quot;\n# keyword does not match &quot;replication&quot;. Access to replication\n# must be enabled in a separate record (see example below).\n#\n# USER can be &quot;all&quot;, a user name, a group name prefixed with &quot;+&quot;, or a\n# comma-separated list thereof.  In both the DATABASE and USER fields\n# you can also write a file name prefixed with &quot;@&quot; to include names\n# from a separate file.\n#\n# ADDRESS specifies the set of hosts the record matches.  It can be a\n# host name, or it is made up of an IP address and a CIDR mask that is\n# an integer (between 0 and 32 (IPv4) or 128 (IPv6) inclusive) that\n# specifies the number of significant bits in the mask.  A host name\n# that starts with a dot (.) matches a suffix of the actual host name.\n# Alternatively, you can write an IP address and netmask in separate\n# columns to specify the set of hosts.  Instead of a CIDR-address, you\n# can write &quot;samehost&quot; to match any of the server's own IP addresses,\n# or &quot;samenet&quot; to match any address in any subnet that the server is\n# directly connected to.\n#\n# METHOD can be &quot;trust&quot;, &quot;reject&quot;, &quot;md5&quot;, &quot;password&quot;, &quot;scram-sha-256&quot;,\n# &quot;gss&quot;, &quot;sspi&quot;, &quot;ident&quot;, &quot;peer&quot;, &quot;pam&quot;, &quot;ldap&quot;, &quot;radius&quot; or &quot;cert&quot;.\n# Note that &quot;password&quot; sends passwords in clear text; &quot;md5&quot; or\n# &quot;scram-sha-256&quot; are preferred since they send encrypted passwords.\n#\n# OPTIONS are a set of options for the authentication in the format\n# NAME=VALUE.  The available options depend on the different\n# authentication methods -- refer to the &quot;Client Authentication&quot;\n# section in the documentation for a list of which options are\n# available for which authentication methods.\n#\n# Database and user names containing spaces, commas, quotes and other\n# special characters must be quoted.  Quoting one of the keywords\n# &quot;all&quot;, &quot;sameuser&quot;, &quot;samerole&quot; or &quot;replication&quot; makes the name lose\n# its special character, and just match a database or username with\n# that name.\n#\n# This file is read on server startup and when the server receives a\n# SIGHUP signal.  If you edit the file on a running system, you have to\n# SIGHUP the server for the changes to take effect, run &quot;pg_ctl reload&quot;,\n# or execute &quot;SELECT pg_reload_conf()&quot;.\n#\n# Put your actual configuration here\n# ----------------------------------\n#\n# If you want to allow non-local connections, you need to add more\n# &quot;host&quot; records.

The entity is a dynamic body with bullet = true and the bullet itself is a kinematic body.\nHere is the code for my contact listener:</p>\n<pre><code>public class CollisionManager implements ContactListener\n{\n\n    @Override\n    public void preSolve(Contact contact, Manifold oldManifold)\n    {\n        Object o1 = contact.getFixtureA().getBody().getUserData();\n        Object o2 = contact.getFixtureB().getBody().getUserData();\n        if (contact.isTouching())\n        {\n            if (o1 instanceof Entity &amp;&amp; o2 instanceof Projectile)\n            {\n                collideBullet((Entity) o1, (Projectile) o2, contact);\n            }\n            else if (o1 instanceof Projectile &amp;&amp; o2 instanceof Entity)\n            {\n                collideBullet((Entity) o2, (Projectile) o1, contact);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n\n    private void collideBullet(Entity entity, Projectile projectile, Contact contact)\n    {\n        if (entity instanceof Enemy &amp;&amp; projectile.getOwner() instanceof Defence)\n        {\n            projectile.setCollided();\n            entity.takeDamage(projectile.getDamage());\n        }\n        else if (entity instanceof Defence &amp;&amp; projectile.getOwner() instanceof Enemy)\n        {\n            projectile.setCollided();\n            entity.takeDamage(projectile.getDamage());\n        }\n        contact.setEnabled(false);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And here is the code for takeDamage in case im an idiot.</p>\n<pre><code>    public void takeDamage(float damage)\n    {\n        this.health -= damage;\n        if (health &lt;= 0)\n        {\n            health = 0;\n            setState(EntityState.DYING);\n            body.setActive(false);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The entities all have one health and the bullets do 10 damage for testing purposes.</p>\n<p>I have tried moving code to presolve instead of beginContact, I have poured through the docs but cannot find what is going wrong, I have tried turning the entity into a bullet, with no changes from that.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","azure","devops","pipeline"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1211967,"reputation":7024,"user_id":1180351,"display_name":"Rob Spoor"},"score":0,"creation_date":1687975094,"post_id":76575223,"comment_id":135013167,"body_markdown":"Where do you checkout the repository?","body":"Where do you checkout the repository?"},{"owner":{"account_id":10362164,"reputation":31,"user_id":11964957,"display_name":"Andrea"},"score":0,"creation_date":1688113576,"post_id":76575223,"comment_id":135033105,"body_markdown":"Ok it worked, thanks!

I have shared a screenshot of the same where I am extracting the sessionId from original request and passing it through to the someMethodCall() as a parameter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bBzov.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bBzov.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":891554,"reputation":8848,"user_id":929701,"accept_rate":79,"display_name":"hrishikeshp19"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":137598,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":46,"accepted_answer_id":24029989,"answer_count":8,"score":46,"last_activity_date":1687969652,"creation_date":1401833931,"question_id":24025924,"body_markdown":"Following is my aspect:\r\n\r\n        @Configurable\r\n        @Aspect\r\n        public class TimingAspect {\r\n        \r\n            @Autowired\r\n            private HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest;\r\n        \r\n            // Generic performance logger for any mothod\r\n            private Object logPerfomanceInfo(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint, String remoteAddress) {\r\n                StringBuilder tag = new StringBuilder();\r\n                if (joinPoint.getTarget() != null) {\r\n                    tag.append(joinPoint.getTarget().getClass().getName());\r\n                    tag.append(&quot;.&quot;);\r\n                }\r\n                tag.append(joinPoint.getSignature().getName());\r\n                StopWatch stopWatch = new StopWatch(tag.toString());\r\n                Object result = joinPoint.proceed(); // continue on the intercepted method\r\n                stopWatch.stop();\r\n        \r\n                PerformanceUtils.logInPerf4jFormat(stopWatch.getStartTime(), stopWatch.getElapsedTime(), stopWatch.getTag(), stopWatch.getMessage(), remoteAddress);\r\n                return result;\r\n            }\r\n        \r\n            @Around(&quot;execution(* $$$.$$$.$$$.api.controller.*.*(..))&quot;)\r\n            public Object logAroundApis(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {\r\n                String remoteAddress = null;\r\n                if (httpServletRequest != null) {\r\n                   remoteAddress = httpServletRequest.getRemoteAddr();\r\n                }\r\n                return logPerfomanceInfo(joinPoint, remoteAddress);\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n            @Around(&quot;execution(* $$$.$$$.$$$.$$$.$$$.$$$.*(..))&quot;)\r\n            public Object logAroundService(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {\r\n                String remoteAddress = null;\r\n                if (httpServletRequest != null) {\r\n                    remoteAddress = httpServletRequest.getRemoteAddr();\r\n                }\r\n                return logPerfomanceInfo(joinPoint, remoteAddress);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not get any compile time errors but I do following exception when I start my jetty server:\r\n\r\n&gt; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalStateException: No thread-bound\r\n&gt; request found: Are you referring to request attributes outside of an\r\n&gt; actual web request, or processing a request outside of the originally\r\n&gt; receiving thread?

The new 23c driver sends the boolean value set through `setBoolean` as a `BOOLEAN` (as opposed to a `NUMBER` in previous versions) and hence you&#39;re getting this `ORA-06550` error because the Database is expecting a `VARCHAR` (your parameters are all `VARCHAR`).\r\n\r\nYou have 3 options:\r\n\r\n 1. Change your PLSQL procedure and make the parameters be BOOLEAN instead of VARCHAR\r\n 2. Or change your Java code to use `setInt(1/0)` instead of `setBoolean(true/false)`\r\n 3. Or set the JDBC property `oracle.jdbc.sendBooleanInPLSQL` to `false` which is a compatibility flag used to make the driver revert to its old behavior. This property can be set on the DataSource or as a Java system property with `-Doracle.jdbc.sendBooleanInPLSQL=false`.\r\n\r\nIf your PLSQL procedure truely deals with `BOOLEAN` parameters then option #1 is the best. Your code would look like this:\r\n\r\n    try { stmt.execute(&quot;CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE TEMP_SENSOR&quot; +\r\n              &quot; (switch1 IN BOOLEAN, switch2 OUT BOOLEAN, switch3 IN OUT BOOLEAN) IS&quot; +\r\n              &quot;  BEGIN &quot; +\r\n              &quot;  switch2  := switch3; &quot; +\r\n              &quot;  switch3 := switch1; &quot; +\r\n              &quot;  END;&quot;); } catch (SQLException sqlex) { }\r\n    \r\n    try ( CallableStatement cstmt = conn.prepareCall(&quot;{ call TEMP_SENSOR(?,?,?) }&quot;); ) {\r\n      cstmt.setBoolean(1, false);\r\n      cstmt.setBoolean(3, true);\r\n      cstmt.registerOutParameter(2, Types.BOOLEAN);\r\n      cstmt.registerOutParameter(3, Types.BOOLEAN);\r\n      cstmt.execute();\r\n    } catch (SQLException sqlex) {sqlex.printStackTrace(); }\r\n\r\nNote the `Types.BOOLEAN` type used in `registerOutParameter`.\r\n\r\nAlso note that option #3 is not recommended and should just be used as a temporary workaround because you will loose the benefits of the new BOOLEAN type.

You can watch the `test` topic with a console listener as follows:\r\n\r\n    ./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \\\r\n        --topic test --from-beginning --group test-console.consumer\r\n\r\nTo test it, you can create a JAX-RS resource to invoke `produce()`:\r\n\r\n\tpackage ...\r\n\t\r\n\timport javax.inject.Inject;\r\n\timport javax.ws.rs.POST;\r\n\timport javax.ws.rs.Path;\r\n\t\r\n\t@Path(&quot;/control&quot;)\r\n\tpublic class KafkaProduceControlResource {\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t@Inject\r\n\t\tKafkaController kafkaController;\r\n\t\r\n\t\t@POST\r\n\t\t@Path(&quot;/produce&quot;)\r\n\t\tpublic void produceMessage(String message) {\r\n\t\t\tkafkaController.produce(message);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nInvoke it from command line as follows and watch the console consumer:\r\n\r\n    curl -i -s -X POST -d &quot;A text message&quot; \\\r\n        http://localhost:8080/control/produce\r\n\r\n**THE HACK:** It seems that annotating `produceKafkaMessage()` with `@Outgoing(&quot;kafka-test&quot;)` fails, because Quarkus does NOT understand that a `KafkaMessage` *is* a `Message`, and is wrapping it in one, resulting in serialization errors. I am bypassing this with the `&quot;internal&quot;` stream.","title":"Is there any function in Quarkus to send message to Kafka","body":"<p>The documentation on this topic is terse and incomplete at this time (Quarkus 0.25.0).

The <code>@Outgoing</code> method simply returns the already constructed stream.</p>\n\n<p>The following component exposes one public method, <code>produce(String message)</code> that will send that text message to Kafka:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package ...\n\nimport java.util.UUID;\n\nimport javax.annotation.PostConstruct;\nimport javax.annotation.PreDestroy;\nimport javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\n\nimport org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;\nimport org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Message;\nimport org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Outgoing;\nimport org.reactivestreams.Publisher;\n\nimport io.reactivex.BackpressureStrategy;\nimport io.reactivex.Flowable;\nimport io.reactivex.FlowableEmitter;\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.KafkaMessage;\n\n@ApplicationScoped\npublic class KafkaController {\n\n    private FlowableEmitter&lt;KafkaMessage&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; emitter;\n\n    private Flowable&lt;KafkaMessage&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; outgoingStream;\n\n    @PostConstruct\n    void init() {\n        outgoingStream = Flowable.create(emitter -&gt; this.emitter = emitter, BackpressureStrategy.BUFFER);\n    }\n\n    public void produce(String message) {\n        emitter.onNext(KafkaMessage.of(UUID.randomUUID().toString(), message));\n    }\n\n    @PreDestroy\n    void dispose() {\n        emitter.onComplete();\n    }\n\n    @Outgoing(\"internal\")\n    Publisher&lt;KafkaMessage&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; produceKafkaMessage() {\n        return outgoingStream;\n    }\n\n    @Incoming(\"internal\")\n    @Outgoing(\"kafka-test\")\n    KafkaMessage&lt;String, String&gt; transform(Message&lt;KafkaMessage&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; arg) {\n        return arg.getPayload();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I created this class in a generated Quarkus application, as documented <a href=\"https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka-guide\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:0.25.0:create \\\n    -DprojectGroupId=org.acme \\\n    -DprojectArtifactId=kafka-quickstart \\\n    -Dextensions=\"kafka\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And configured (<code>application.properties</code>) as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>kafka.bootstrap.servers=localhost:9092\n\nmp.messaging.outgoing.kafka-test.connector=smallrye-kafka\nmp.messaging.outgoing.kafka-test.topic=test\nmp.messaging.outgoing.kafka-test.key.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer\nmp.messaging.outgoing.kafka-test.value.serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A Kafka instance is started exactly as described in the <a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#quickstart\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">quickstart</a>. You can watch the <code>test</code> topic with a console listener as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \\\n    --topic test --from-beginning --group test-console.consumer\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To test it, you can create a JAX-RS resource to invoke <code>produce()</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package ...\n\nimport javax.inject.Inject;\nimport javax.ws.rs.POST;\nimport javax.ws.rs.Path;\n\n@Path(\"/control\")\npublic class KafkaProduceControlResource {\n\n    @Inject\n    KafkaController kafkaController;\n\n    @POST\n    @Path(\"/produce\")\n    public void produceMessage(String message) {\n        kafkaController.produce(message);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Invoke it from command line as follows and watch the console consumer:</p>\n\n<pre><code>curl -i -s -X POST -d \"A text message\" \\\n    http://localhost:8080/control/produce\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>THE HACK:</strong> It seems that annotating <code>produceKafkaMessage()</code> with <code>@Outgoing(\"kafka-test\")</code> fails, because Quarkus does NOT understand that a <code>KafkaMessage</code> <em>is</em> a <code>Message</code>, and is wrapping it in one, resulting in serialization errors. I am bypassing this with the <code>\"internal\"</code> stream.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":7228220,"reputation":1559,"user_id":5516057,"display_name":"Marc"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1687958803,"creation_date":1687958803,"answer_id":76573647,"question_id":58340609,"body_markdown":"It&#39;s been a while since this was asked but at the moment this can be achieved using the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n    import io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.Record;\r\n    import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Channel;\r\n    import jakarta.inject.Inject;\r\n    import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;\r\n    import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;\r\n    import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;\r\n    import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Emitter;\r\n\r\n    public class ExampleProducer {\r\n    \r\n        @Inject\r\n        @Channel(&quot;single-stations&quot;)\r\n        Emitter&lt;Record&lt;Integer, String&gt;&gt; stationEmitter;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        // when GET called send message to topic\r\n        @GET\r\n        @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)\r\n        public String hello() {\r\n            var message = generateSingle();\r\n            stationEmitter.send(message);\r\n            return &quot;hello&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        public Record&lt;Integer, String&gt; generateSingle() {\r\n            return Record.of(1, &quot;value&quot;);\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe Emitter object allows you to send messages on a non continuous manner. \r\n\r\nBut a lot more information is available here https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka#sending-messages-to-kafka","title":"Is there any function in Quarkus to send message to Kafka","body":"<p>It's been a while since this was asked but at the moment this can be achieved using the following:</p>\n<pre><code>import io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.kafka.Record;\nimport org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Channel;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport jakarta.ws.rs.GET;\nimport jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;\nimport jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;\nimport org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Emitter;\n\npublic class ExampleProducer {\n\n    @Inject\n    @Channel(&quot;single-stations&quot;)\n    Emitter&lt;Record&lt;Integer, String&gt;&gt; stationEmitter;\n\n\n    // when GET called send message to topic\n    @GET\n    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)\n    public String hello() {\n        var message = generateSingle();\n        stationEmitter.send(message);\n        return &quot;hello&quot;;\n    }\n    \n    public Record&lt;Integer, String&gt; generateSingle() {\n        return Record.of(1, &quot;value&quot;);\n    };\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Emitter object allows you to send messages on a non continuous manner.</p>\n<p>But a lot more information is available here <a href=\"https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka#sending-messages-to-kafka\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka#sending-messages-to-kafka</a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":16872561,"reputation":95,"user_id":12200758,"display_name":"Jithin S"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":2465,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58421690,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1687958803,"creation_date":1570794318,"question_id":58340609,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m new to kafka and quarkus, i want to send message to kafka topic when a user request has processed. \r\n\r\nI have gone through kafka example provided in quarkus-quickstart.

The general idea is that you have immutable classes (classes without any setters; the instances of these classes cannot change after construction. `String` is immutable, so is `Integer`, and so is `BigDecimal`. There is no `.setValue()` on an integer instance, there is no `setChar()` on a string, or even a `clear()` or an `append()` - all operations on immutables that appear to modify things actually return a new instance that contains the result of the operation. `someBigDecimal.add()` doesn&#39;t change what `someBigDecimal` is pointing at; it constructs a new bigDecimal instance and returns that.\r\n\r\nWith immutables, if you want to change things, Stream&#39;s `map` method is the right one to use: For example, if you have a stream of BigDecimal objects and you want to, say, print them all, but with 2.5 added to them, you&#39;d be calling `map`: You want to map each input BigDecimal into an output BD by asking the BD instance to make a new BD instance by adding 2.5 to itself.\r\n\r\nWith mutables, both `map` and `peek` are more relevant. Style debates are rife on what to do. `peek` just lets you witness what&#39;s going through a stream pipeline. It can be misleading because stream pipelines dont process anything until you stick a terminator on the end (something like `collect`, or `max()` or whatnot, those are &#39;terminators&#39;). When talking about mutables, `peek` in theory works just as well as map does and some (evidently, including intellij&#39;s auto-suggest authors) are of the belief that a map operation that really just mutates the underlying object in the stream and returns the same reference is a style violation and should be replaced with a `peek` operation instead.\r\n\r\nBut the far more relevant observation is that __stream operations should not be mutating anything at all__. Do not call setters.\r\n\r\nYou have 2 options:\r\n\r\n1. Massively refactor this code, make `CustomIdentifier` immutable (get rid of the setters, make all fields final, consider adding with-ers and builders and the like), change your peek code to something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.map(identifier -&gt; {\r\n    if (....) return customerIdentifier.with(RefType.REF);\r\n    return identifier.withCountry(new Country(summary.get..., summary.get...));\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `Country` also needs this treatment.\r\n\r\n2. Do not use streams.\r\n\r\nThis is much simpler. This code is __vastly__ less confusing and better style if you just write a foreach loop. I have no idea why you thought streams were appropriate here. Streams are not &#39;better&#39;. A problem is that adherents of functional style are so incredibly convinced they are correct they spread copious FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) about non-functional approaches and strongly insinuate that functional style is &#39;just better&#39;. This is not true - it&#39;s merely a different style that is more suitable to some domains and less to others.

This is peek and the terminal in one package. It gets rid of the pointless `collect` (which just recreates a list that is 100% identical to what `customerSummary.getCustomerIdentifiers()` returns) call and properly represents what is actually happening (which is NOT that you&#39;re writing code that witnesses what is flowing through the stream pipe, you&#39;re writing code that you intend to execute on each element in the stream).\r\n\r\nBut that&#39;s still much worse than this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCustomerSummary summary = customerSummaryDTO.getCustomerSummary();\r\nfor (CustomerIdentifier identifier : summary.getCustomerIdentifiers()) {\r\n    if (getCustomerReferenceTypes().contains(customerIdentifier.getIdentifierType())) {\r\n        customerIdentifier.setRefType(RefType.REF.toString());\r\n    } else {\r\n        customerIdentifier.setRefType(RefType.TAX.toString());\r\n        Country country = new Country();\r\n        country.setIsoCountryCode(customerSummary.getCustomerAddresses().get(0).getIsoCountryCode());\r\n        country.setCountryName(customerSummary.getCustomerAddresses().get(0).getCountryName());\r\n        customerIdentifier.setCountry(country);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nreturn customerSummary;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Style mistake #2: stringly typing\r\n\r\nWhy isn&#39;t the refType field in `CustomerIdentifier` just `RefType`?

When you want to use a Groovy API in Java 8 code, you cannot call a method expecting a Closure with a lambda expression. <code>Closure</code> isn't a functional interface but an abstract class, and that can simply not be implemented by a lambda expression.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1750411,"reputation":189,"user_id":1599616,"display_name":"Scott Langeberg"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1589210629,"creation_date":1589210629,"answer_id":61733272,"question_id":25565020,"body_markdown":"I wanted a simple local closure to pass / execute.
