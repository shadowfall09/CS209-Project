That is to say, how do you _guarantee_ that the other thread won&#39;t call `foo.notify()` _before_ the first thread calls `foo.wait()`?  That&#39;s important because the foo object will not remember that it was notified if the notify call happens first.  If there&#39;s only one notify(), and if it happens before the wait(), then the wait() will never return.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s how wait and notify were meant to be used:\r\n\r\n    private Queue&lt;Product&gt; q = ...;\r\n    private Object lock = new Object();\r\n\r\n    void produceSomething(...) {\r\n        Product p = reallyProduceSomething();\r\n        synchronized(lock) {\r\n            q.add(p);\r\n            lock.notify();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void consumeSomething(...) {\r\n        Product p = null;\r\n        synchronized(lock) {\r\n            while (q.peek() == null) {\r\n                lock.wait();\r\n            }\r\n            p = q.remove();\r\n        }\r\n        reallyConsume(p);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe most important things to to note in this example are that there is an explicit test for the condition (i.e., q.peek() != null), and that nobody changes the condition without locking the lock.\r\n\r\nIf the consumer is called first, then it will find the queue empty, and it will wait.  There is no moment when the producer can slip in, add a Product to the queue, and then notify the lock until the consumer is ready to receive that notification.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the producer is called first, then the consumer is guaranteed not to call wait().\r\n\r\nThe loop in the consumer is important for two reasons:  One is that, if there is more than one consumer thread, then it is possible for one consumer to receive a notification, but then another consumer sneaks in and steals the Product from the queue.  The only reasonable thing for the fist consumer to do in that case is wait again for the next Product.  The other reason that the loop is important is that the Javadoc says Object.wait() is allowed to return even when the object has not been notified.  That is called a &quot;spurious wakeup&quot;, and the correct way to handle it is to go back and wait again.\r\n\r\nAlso note:  The lock is `private` and the queue is `private`.  That guarantees that no other compilation unit is going to interfere with the synchronization in this compilation unit.\r\n\r\nAnd note: The lock is a different object from the queue itself.

I think that it is related to use of old JOGL versions, I'm seeing it with JOGL 2.1.5ish. Presumably this remains unresolved due to the existence of newer versions of JOGL. I can't test this theory yet, though, hopefully I'll get a chance to do that sooner than later.</p>\n<p><strong>Workaround</strong></p>\n<p>As far as I can, the problem first started appearing with version JDK8u252+ and JDK11.0.7+. If I use JDK8u242 or JDK11.0.6 then I no longer see the issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Investigation</strong></p>\n<p>Based on the versions where I first see problems, It appears to be related to a commit in the Jan 2020 to April 2020 timeframe, possibly this commit: <code>4f1fabd8d08581bc9e0c4b3cc7dffb7f7cc0d5c8</code> in the <a href=\"https://github.com/openjdk/jdk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OpenJDK project</a>. However, with that said, take the pointer to this specific commit with a huge grain of salt, because it's basically just an edit in the right timeframe (I think) that touches what appears to be related code. I only mention it in case it might help someone with more knowledge in the area narrow down the problem.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":22527141,"reputation":1,"user_id":16719760,"display_name":"Amir Ahmed Imtiaz"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1640081067,"creation_date":1640081067,"answer_id":70433640,"question_id":64331790,"body_markdown":"I faced the same problem.Just use an earlier version of java8 (JDK 8u202) and set the eclipse compiler to level 1.8 and then you should be able to get rid of the error.","title":"Apple AWT Internal Exception: NSWindow drag regions should only be invalidated on the Main Thread","body":"<p>I faced the same problem.Just use an earlier version of java8 (JDK 8u202) and set the eclipse compiler to level 1.8 and then you should be able to get rid of the error.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":23972159,"reputation":1,"user_id":17960704,"display_name":"Kirill Bubnov"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1642478533,"creation_date":1642478533,"answer_id":70750145,"question_id":64331790,"body_markdown":"try to remove the OPENGL argument P2D in public void setup() {\r\n            size(800, 600, P2D);","title":"Apple AWT Internal Exception: NSWindow drag regions should only be invalidated on the Main Thread","body":"<p>try to remove the OPENGL argument P2D in public void setup() {\nsize(800, 600, P2D);</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":18144993,"reputation":11,"user_id":13198408,"display_name":"Shawon Majid"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1644523962,"creation_date":1644523962,"answer_id":71071687,"question_id":64331790,"body_markdown":"You have to use jdk8u242-b08 for jre. \r\n[download from here][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk8-binaries/releases/tag/jdk8u242-b08","title":"Apple AWT Internal Exception: NSWindow drag regions should only be invalidated on the Main Thread","body":"<p>You have to use jdk8u242-b08 for jre.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk8-binaries/releases/tag/jdk8u242-b08\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">download from here</a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":16647857,"reputation":71,"user_id":12031678,"display_name":"Ani"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":3963,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":7,"answer_count":4,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1653744187,"creation_date":1602578924,"question_id":64331790,"body_markdown":"I am trying to run a PApplet class.

To get a current download URL, use StorageReference.getDownloadUr().</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So now when calling <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/storage/StorageReference.html#getDownloadUrl()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">getDownloadUrl()</a> on a <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/storage/StorageReference\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">StorageReference</a> object it returns a <code>Task</code> object and <strong>not</strong> an Uri object anymore.</p>\n<p>Please also rememeber, neither the success listener nor the failure listener (if you intend to use it), will be called if your device cannot reach Firebase Storage backend. The success/failure listeners will only be called once the data is committed to, or rejected by the Firebase servers.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":11790329,"reputation":306,"user_id":8626698,"accept_rate":29,"display_name":"ajay dhadhal"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":9384,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"answer_count":1,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1653742604,"creation_date":1542197350,"question_id":53299915,"body_markdown":"I want to get the Download Url from `uploadTask.addOnProgressListener` method of Firebase.
