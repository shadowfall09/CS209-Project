Also see [Which browsers and operating systems support Let’s Encrypt](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/which-browsers-and-operating-systems-support-lets-encrypt/4394).\r\n\r\nSo, in order to connect to the domain I was interested in, which had a certificate issued from `identrust.com` I did the following steps. Basically, I had to get the identrust.com (`DST Root CA X3`) certificate to be trusted by the JVM. I was able to do that using Apache HttpComponents 4.5 like so:\r\n\r\n1: Obtain the certificate from indettrust at [Certificate Chain Download Instructions](https://www.identrust.com/certificates/trustid/install-nes36.html). Click on the [DST Root CA X3](https://www.identrust.com/certificates/trustid/root-download-x3.html) link.\r\n\r\n2: Save the string to a file named &quot;DST Root CA X3.pem&quot;. Be sure to add the lines &quot;-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----&quot; and &quot;-----END CERTIFICATE-----&quot; in the file at the beginning and the end.\r\n\r\n3: Create a java keystore file, cacerts.jks with the following command: \r\n\r\n    keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias IdenTrust -keypass yourpassword -file dst_root_ca_x3.pem -keystore cacerts.jks -storepass yourpassword\r\n\r\n4: Copy the resulting cacerts.jks keystore into the resources directory of your java/(maven) application.\r\n\r\n5: Use the following code to load this file and attach it to the Apache 4.5 HttpClient. This will solve the problem for all domains that have certificates issued from `indetrust.com` util oracle includes the certificate into the JRE default keystore.\r\n\r\n    SSLContext sslcontext = SSLContexts.custom()\r\n            .loadTrustMaterial(new File(CalRestClient.class.getResource(&quot;/cacerts.jks&quot;).getFile()), &quot;yourpasword&quot;.toCharArray(),\r\n                    new TrustSelfSignedStrategy())\r\n            .build();\r\n    // Allow TLSv1 protocol only\r\n    SSLConnectionSocketFactory sslsf = new SSLConnectionSocketFactory(\r\n            sslcontext,\r\n            new String[] { &quot;TLSv1&quot; },\r\n            null,\r\n            SSLConnectionSocketFactory.getDefaultHostnameVerifier());\r\n    CloseableHttpClient httpclient = HttpClients.custom()\r\n            .setSSLSocketFactory(sslsf)\r\n            .build();\r\n\r\nWhen the project builds then the cacerts.jks will be copied into the classpath and loaded from there. I didn&#39;t, at this point in time, test against other ssl sites, but if the above code &quot;chains&quot; in this certificate then they will work too, but again, I don&#39;t know.\r\n\r\nReference: [Custom SSL context](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpclient/examples/org/apache/http/examples/client/ClientCustomSSL.java) and [How do I accept a self-signed certificate with a Java HttpsURLConnection?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/859111/how-do-i-accept-a-self-signed-certificate-with-a-java-httpsurlconnection/859271#859271)\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.identrust.com\r\n  [2]: https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/will-the-cross-root-cover-trust-by-the-default-list-in-the-jdk-jre/134/24","title":"Accept server&#39;s self-signed ssl certificate in Java client","body":"<p>I chased down this problem to a certificate provider that is not part of the default JVM trusted hosts as of <code>JDK 8u74</code>.

Basically, I had to get the identrust.com (<code>DST Root CA X3</code>) certificate to be trusted by the JVM. I was able to do that using Apache HttpComponents 4.5 like so:</p>\n\n<p>1: Obtain the certificate from indettrust at <a href=\"https://www.identrust.com/certificates/trustid/install-nes36.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Certificate Chain Download Instructions</a>. Click on the <a href=\"https://www.identrust.com/certificates/trustid/root-download-x3.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">DST Root CA X3</a> link.</p>\n\n<p>2: Save the string to a file named \"DST Root CA X3.pem\". Be sure to add the lines \"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\" and \"-----END CERTIFICATE-----\" in the file at the beginning and the end.</p>\n\n<p>3: Create a java keystore file, cacerts.jks with the following command: </p>\n\n<pre><code>keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -alias IdenTrust -keypass yourpassword -file dst_root_ca_x3.pem -keystore cacerts.jks -storepass yourpassword\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>4: Copy the resulting cacerts.jks keystore into the resources directory of your java/(maven) application.</p>\n\n<p>5: Use the following code to load this file and attach it to the Apache 4.5 HttpClient. This will solve the problem for all domains that have certificates issued from <code>indetrust.com</code> util oracle includes the certificate into the JRE default keystore.</p>\n\n<pre><code>SSLContext sslcontext = SSLContexts.custom()\n        .loadTrustMaterial(new File(CalRestClient.class.getResource(\"/cacerts.jks\").getFile()), \"yourpasword\".toCharArray(),\n                new TrustSelfSignedStrategy())\n        .build();\n// Allow TLSv1 protocol only\nSSLConnectionSocketFactory sslsf = new SSLConnectionSocketFactory(\n        sslcontext,\n        new String[] { \"TLSv1\" },\n        null,\n        SSLConnectionSocketFactory.getDefaultHostnameVerifier());\nCloseableHttpClient httpclient = HttpClients.custom()\n        .setSSLSocketFactory(sslsf)\n        .build();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the project builds then the cacerts.jks will be copied into the classpath and loaded from there. I didn't, at this point in time, test against other ssl sites, but if the above code \"chains\" in this certificate then they will work too, but again, I don't know.</p>\n\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpclient/examples/org/apache/http/examples/client/ClientCustomSSL.java\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Custom SSL context</a> and <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/859111/how-do-i-accept-a-self-signed-certificate-with-a-java-httpsurlconnection/859271#859271\">How do I accept a self-signed certificate with a Java HttpsURLConnection?</a></p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":301110,"reputation":98854,"user_id":608639,"accept_rate":64,"display_name":"jww"},"score":2,"creation_date":1496569313,"post_id":40545408,"comment_id":75707459,"body_markdown":"Your `checkServerTrusted` does not implement the necessary logic to actually trust the certificate ***and*** ensure non-trusted certificates are rejected.

As explained in the [DriverManager][4] chapter of [Getting Started with the JDBC API][5]:\r\n\r\n&gt; (...) A `Driver` class is loaded, and\r\n&gt; therefore automatically registered\r\n&gt; with the `DriverManager`, in one of two\r\n&gt; ways:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 1. by calling the method `Class.forName`. This explicitly loads\r\n&gt; the driver class. Since it does not\r\n&gt; depend on any external setup, this way\r\n&gt; of loading a driver is the recommended\r\n&gt; one for using the `DriverManager`\r\n&gt; framework. The following code loads\r\n&gt; the class `acme.db.Driver`:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;         Class.forName(&quot;acme.db.Driver&quot;);\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;   **If `acme.db.Driver` has been written so that loading it causes an\r\n&gt; instance to be created and also calls\r\n&gt; `DriverManager.registerDriver` with that\r\n&gt; instance as the parameter** (as it\r\n&gt; should do), then it is in the\r\n&gt; `DriverManager`&#39;s list of drivers and\r\n&gt; available for creating a connection.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 2. (...) \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; In both of these cases, it is the responsibility of the newly-loaded `Driver` class to register itself by calling `DriverManager.registerDriver`. As mentioned, this should be done automatically when the class is loaded. \r\n\r\nTo register themselves during initialization, JDBC driver typically use a static initialization block like this:\r\n\r\n    package acme.db;\r\n    \r\n    public class Driver {\r\n    \r\n        static {\r\n            java.sql.DriverManager.registerDriver(new Driver());\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nCalling `Class.forName(&quot;acme.db.Driver&quot;)` causes the initialization of the `acme.db.Driver` class and thus the execution of the static initialization block. And  `Class.forName(&quot;acme.db.Driver&quot;)` will indeed &quot;create&quot; an instance but this is just a consequence of how (good) JDBC Driver are implemented.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I&#39;d mention that all this is not required anymore with JDBC 4.0(added as a default package since Java 7) and the new auto-loading feature of JDBC 4.0 drivers.

If that's what is desired, I leave making that small change as an exercise for the OP\n\nfor seq in (seq1, seq2):\n    t = seq['start']\n    while t &lt; seq['start'] + lcm + seq['extra']:\n        for o in range(seq['duration']):\n            tt = offset + t + o\n            minutes[tt] += 1\n        t += seq['repeat_interval']\n\n# At this point, overlaps consist of values in the 'minutes' array that have a value of 2, meaning\n# that both sequences were &quot;on&quot; during that minute.

So:</p>\n<pre><code>count = minutes[m % lcm]\n</code></pre>\n<p>If count == 2, then minute 'm' was part of an overlap, for any value of 'm'.</p>\n<p>Oh..one other thing, and maybe this is where my answer lost the green check.  This answer doesn't account for times specified as hours and minutes.  It just gives the answer to the basic idea of calculating overlaps and doing so for the minimum necessary cycle length, with all values represented in minutes.  To do this for hours, or days, all one would have to do is convert the time values to a minutes-only representation.  Time zones would also add complexity, but you'd just offset the minutes values to account for any time zone shift.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":20826185,"reputation":33,"user_id":19357801,"display_name":"Satoshi"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":120,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":73769865,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1664545218,"creation_date":1663571156,"question_id":73769609,"body_markdown":"In brief, I have:\r\n```\r\nstartTime (When my interval chain will start)\r\n\r\nrepeatEveryMinuteInterval (Repeat every minute of this action)\r\n\r\nduration (Duration of the action)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt builds the chain of the intervals.

The objectId will be\n * the id of the object to fetch, and the fieldValueToReturn will be the field to return.\n *\n * @return the value of the provided field-path converted to the class type provided\n */\npublic &lt;T&gt; T getFieldValueById(String objectId, String fieldValueToReturn, String collectionName, Class&lt;T&gt; classTypeToReturn) {\n    var query = new Query().addCriteria(Criteria.where(&quot;_id&quot;).is(objectId));\n    query.fields().include(fieldValueToReturn);\n    var result = mongoTemplate.findOne(query, org.bson.Document.class, collectionName);\n    requireNonNull(result, &quot;Did not find any documents with id '&quot; + objectId + &quot;' in collection: &quot; + collectionName);\n    return result.getEmbedded(Arrays.asList(fieldValueToReturn.split(&quot;\\\\.&quot;)), classTypeToReturn);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>getEmbedded</code> call allows us to get the value of the nested field within the returned Bson document.</p>\n<p>To use the method, just call it like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>getFieldValueById(&quot;A1234&quot;, &quot;field.nestedfield.nestedfield&quot;, &quot;collectionName&quot;, String.class);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Hopefully this helps out someone else looking on how to do this.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As a side note, I'm not sure how to extend this to return a list of objects - if I get to that dilemma and solve it, I will try to update this answer. I'm also not sure if this is slower than running a Mongo aggregate query - I haven't tried running any performance comparisons between the two methods.</p>\n<p>EDIT 2022-09-30: To return a list of a custom Pojo, it looks like you'll have to use an aggregate query via spring-data-mongodb. Also it seems basic queries are faster than aggregate queries, so use basic queries where possible.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3223178,"reputation":688,"user_id":2720078,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"akshitmahajan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1646989138,"creation_date":1646989138,"answer_id":71436001,"question_id":32108953,"body_markdown":"You can directly pass your json query with @Query annotation, for example:\r\n\r\n    @Query(&quot;{ &#39;firstname&#39; : &#39;john&#39; }&quot;)\r\n\r\nHere is the link to all json based queries in Spring Data MongoDb - https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/current/reference/html/#mongodb.repositories.queries.json-based","title":"How to return only specific fields for a query in Spring Data MongoDB?","body":"<p>You can directly pass your json query with @Query annotation, for example:</p>\n<pre><code>@Query(&quot;{ 'firstname' : 'john' }&quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is the link to all json based queries in Spring Data MongoDb - <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/current/reference/html/#mongodb.repositories.queries.json-based\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/current/reference/html/#mongodb.repositories.queries.json-based</a></p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":11687036,"reputation":31,"user_id":8556469,"display_name":"Bondo Kalombo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1652267357,"creation_date":1652267357,"answer_id":72199981,"question_id":32108953,"body_markdown":"You can do the following.\r\n\r\nIn your repository, you have the method:\r\n\r\n    String findPathByPath(String path);\r\n\r\nIf the document looks like this (below), and you want to only return path\r\n\r\n    @Document(collection = &quot;foo&quot;)\r\n    public class Foo  {\r\n    \r\n      String name;\r\n      String path;\r\n      String type;\r\n      …\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen create a Projection interface, e.g.\r\n\r\n    @Projection(name = &quot;flattenedFoo&quot;, types = Foo.class)\r\n    public interface FlattenedInvoice {\r\n        String getPath(); // This returns the path value in Foo class\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can use the getter methods to get the fields from Foo that you are interested in.\r\n\r\nThen in your get request, you would have to specify the projectionName.\r\ne.g. with (@Resource path)\r\n\r\n    @RestResource(path = &quot;findByPath&quot;, rel = &quot;findByPath&quot;)\r\n    String findPathByPath(String path);\r\n\r\nYou could then say (In a get request):\r\n\r\n..../findByPath?path=target_path&amp;projection=flattenedFoo\r\n\r\nthis would then return a json with only the fields specifies in FlattenedFoo interface.","title":"How to return only specific fields for a query in Spring Data MongoDB?","body":"<p>You can do the following.</p>\n<p>In your repository, you have the method:</p>\n<pre><code>String findPathByPath(String path);\n</code></pre>\n<p>If the document looks like this (below), and you want to only return path</p>\n<pre><code>@Document(collection = &quot;foo&quot;)\npublic class Foo  {\n\n  String name;\n  String path;\n  String type;\n  …\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then create a Projection interface, e.g.</p>\n<pre><code>@Projection(name = &quot;flattenedFoo&quot;, types = Foo.class)\npublic interface FlattenedInvoice {\n    String getPath(); // This returns the path value in Foo class\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can use the getter methods to get the fields from Foo that you are interested in.</p>\n<p>Then in your get request, you would have to specify the projectionName.\ne.g. with (@Resource path)</p>\n<pre><code>@RestResource(path = &quot;findByPath&quot;, rel = &quot;findByPath&quot;)\nString findPathByPath(String path);\n</code></pre>\n<p>You could then say (In a get request):</p>\n<p>..../findByPath?path=target_path&amp;projection=flattenedFoo</p>\n<p>this would then return a json with only the fields specifies in FlattenedFoo interface.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":4211138,"reputation":4722,"user_id":3448799,"accept_rate":26,"display_name":"richersoon"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":76840,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":29,"answer_count":7,"score":29,"last_activity_date":1664545137,"creation_date":1440040375,"question_id":32108953,"body_markdown":"How can we select specific fields in Spring Data Mongo.

The application allows the possiblity of defining additional columns outside of the usual ones listed in an entity, which are modelled with a `Map&lt;String, Object&gt;` (call it `additionalFields`) in each entity (the key is the name of a field/column, while the value that field/column&#39;s value).\r\n\r\nTo model this so far we&#39;ve had an entity (let&#39;s call it `FieldDefinition`) which contains the information of this mapping (the name of the field, the type, the precision or maximum length if that applies, etc.)\r\n\r\nSo, after creating the `SessionFactory`, we would use it to obtain a `session`, access all instances of `FieldDefinition` and add the mappings dynamically through `configuration.getClassMapping(entityClassName)`, `configuration.createMappings()`, and related methods.\r\n\r\nThese last methods in `Configuration` have been removed from Hibernate 5, hence the problem I&#39;m trying to solve. If I understand correctly, with the new API I would need to:\r\n\r\n 1. Create a `SessionFactory` that understands about `FieldDefinition`.\r\n 2. Use it to access it and retrieve the `FieldDefinition`s.\r\n 3.

What you aim to do seems to me like you need certain objects react/act/process to a common object/event in the application but <em>each</em> with their own interpretation/algorithm/implementation.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":95715,"reputation":20966,"user_id":260511,"accept_rate":81,"display_name":"rayman"},"score":0,"creation_date":1334739800,"post_id":10205864,"comment_id":13106349,"body_markdown":"Hi, But two things: where do I put my listener implementation? and how do I inject it into MyMessage class. second when/where do I need to use the execution code you wrote below?","body":"Hi, But two things: where do I put my listener implementation? and how do I inject it into MyMessage class. second when/where do I need to use the execution code you wrote below?"},{"owner":{"account_id":250725,"reputation":9776,"user_id":527617,"accept_rate":69,"display_name":"UVM"},"score":0,"creation_date":1334742626,"post_id":10205864,"comment_id":13107412,"body_markdown":"In normal MDBs, we are executing some business logic, right.That is executed automatically.So how this happens is your MDB is loaded.2.Once it is loaded, check whether annotation is present.3.If annotation is present, you cast this loaded class to MyMessageListener interface.That is the code I have shown you.But keep it mind that all these mechanism are happening inside the framework that is abstracted.I am talking that scenario only.4.Now framework, is doing some operation like , getting the message from queue or do some operation.5.Then it is calling messagelistener.message() method.","body":"In normal MDBs, we are executing some business logic, right.That is executed automatically.So how this happens is your MDB is loaded.2.Once it is loaded, check whether annotation is present.3.If annotation is present, you cast this loaded class to MyMessageListener interface.That is the code I have shown you.But keep it mind that all these mechanism are happening inside the framework that is abstracted.I am talking that scenario only.4.Now framework, is doing some operation like , getting the message from queue or do some operation.5.Then it is calling messagelistener.message() method."},{"owner":{"account_id":95715,"reputation":20966,"user_id":260511,"accept_rate":81,"display_name":"rayman"},"score":0,"creation_date":1334745228,"post_id":10205864,"comment_id":13108499,"body_markdown":"Could you show where do I implement the &quot;Listening&quot;
