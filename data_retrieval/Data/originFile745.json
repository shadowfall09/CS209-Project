I would like this code generation to occur during our Maven build, and I am using the `maven-jaxb2-plugin` for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe OGC schema files require numerous patches in order to be compiled into JAXB classes by XJC. Luckily, the original developer of the `maven-jaxb2-plugin` coincidentally also created the [ogc-schemas](https://github.com/highsource/ogc-schemas) project which contains pre-built JAXB bindings and episode files for many OGC schema files, including GML 3.2.1. Unfortunately from the repository issues list, it sounds like he tragically passed away in 2021.\r\n\r\nBy using the episode file from `org.jvnet.ogc:gml-v_3_2_1` together with some custom bindings for one of the AIXM schema files, I was finally able to get maven-jaxb2-plugin to generate code. However, the code it generates does not compile. I do not do much Java development, so I may be doing something obviously wrong here.\r\n\r\nMany of the classes it generates fail to compile with an error like this:\r\n\r\n&gt;aixm.ApronElementTimeSliceType is not abstract and does not override abstract method createNewInstance() in org.jvnet.jaxb2_commons.lang.CopyTo2\r\n\r\nIn this case, the abstract method is declared in `net.opengis.gml.v_3_2_1.AbstractTimeSliceType` and the inheritance tree looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\naixm.ApronElementTimeSliceType (generated in my project)\r\n extends aixm.AbstractAIXMTimeSliceType (generated in my project)\r\n  extends aixm.AbstractAIXMTimeSliceBaseType (generated in my project)\r\n   extends net.opengis.gml.v_3_2_1.AbstractTimeSliceType (imported from org.jvnet.ogc:gml-v_3_2_1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is not clear to me how I can get `maven-jaxb2-plugin` to generate an implementation for createNewInstance() in each of these generated non-abstract classes. It looks like the needed implementation is pretty simple... pretty much `new CLASS_NAME_HERE()`.\r\n\r\nHere is my pom.xml file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

JAXB classes for the <a href=\"https://www.aixm.aero/document/aixm-511-xml-schema-xsd\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AIXM XSDs</a>, which unfortunately are quite complicated and reference the even more complicated OGC GML 3.2.1, xlink and ISO 19139 schemas. I would like this code generation to occur during our Maven build, and I am using the <code>maven-jaxb2-plugin</code> for this purpose.</p>\n<p>The OGC schema files require numerous patches in order to be compiled into JAXB classes by XJC. Luckily, the original developer of the <code>maven-jaxb2-plugin</code> coincidentally also created the <a href=\"https://github.com/highsource/ogc-schemas\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ogc-schemas</a> project which contains pre-built JAXB bindings and episode files for many OGC schema files, including GML 3.2.1. Unfortunately from the repository issues list, it sounds like he tragically passed away in 2021.</p>\n<p>By using the episode file from <code>org.jvnet.ogc:gml-v_3_2_1</code> together with some custom bindings for one of the AIXM schema files, I was finally able to get maven-jaxb2-plugin to generate code. However, the code it generates does not compile. I do not do much Java development, so I may be doing something obviously wrong here.</p>\n<p>Many of the classes it generates fail to compile with an error like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>aixm.ApronElementTimeSliceType is not abstract and does not override abstract method createNewInstance() in org.jvnet.jaxb2_commons.lang.CopyTo2</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this case, the abstract method is declared in <code>net.opengis.gml.v_3_2_1.AbstractTimeSliceType</code> and the inheritance tree looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>aixm.ApronElementTimeSliceType (generated in my project)\n extends aixm.AbstractAIXMTimeSliceType (generated in my project)\n  extends aixm.AbstractAIXMTimeSliceBaseType (generated in my project)\n   extends net.opengis.gml.v_3_2_1.AbstractTimeSliceType (imported from org.jvnet.ogc:gml-v_3_2_1)\n</code></pre>\n<p>It is not clear to me how I can get <code>maven-jaxb2-plugin</code> to generate an implementation for createNewInstance() in each of these generated non-abstract classes. It looks like the needed implementation is pretty simple... pretty much <code>new CLASS_NAME_HERE()</code>.</p>\n<p>Here is my pom.xml file:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

So, if you want an appointment to a doctor who has an appointment at any time, even if it does not overlap your time interval, then `false` will be returned.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nYou need to avoid returning a truth value just because the doctor matches your searched doctor, because we are not interested in whether the doctor has some arbitrary appointments, but we are interested whether the doctor has an appointment at the time in search. Instead, wrap this if around the two other criterias, like below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public boolean isAvailable(Doctor doctor, LocalDateTime startTime, int duration, List&lt;Consultation&gt; consultationList) {\r\n    for (Consultation consultation : consultationList) {\r\n        if (doctor == consultation.getDoctor()) {\r\n            // Check if the start time of the desired consultation falls within the duration of an existing consultation\r\n            if (startTime.isAfter(consultation.getDateTime()) &amp;&amp; startTime.isBefore(consultation.getDateTime().plusHours(consultation.getHourCount()))) {\r\n                return false;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            // Check if the end time of the desired consultation falls within the duration of an existing consultation\r\n            LocalDateTime endTime = startTime.plusHours(duration);\r\n            if (endTime.isAfter(consultation.getDateTime()) &amp;&amp; endTime.isBefore(consultation.getDateTime().plusHours(consultation.getHourCount()))) {\r\n                return false;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also simplify your criteria by stating that if it&#39;s not true that `startTime` is later than the end time of the consultation or `endTime` is earlier than the start time of the consultation, then return false, but I avoided doing that refactor to keep the code close to your initial version.","title":"Why is For loop not correctly adding elements to the arraylist object?","body":"<p>You are looping through consultations and you return false at the first unavailability.

This can be easily verified by a simple example like this one:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Sample(val message : String) {\n    fun getMessage() :String = \"MyString\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This happens because the property <code>message</code> (in your case, the message from <code>Throwable</code>) and the <code>getMessage</code> function (in your case, the <code>getMessage</code> from GraphQL) converts to the same JVM signature. It seems to me that the current status quo is that property accessors are not treated as individual members so they cannot be overriden by member functions or even implement abstract functions.

In other words, under normal circumstances both &quot;at most once&quot; and &quot;at least once&quot; will deliver a message exactly once.\r\n\r\nWhat distinguishes &quot;at most once&quot; and &quot;at least once&quot; is how they handle problems. For example, imagine a sample application that sends a million messages from actor A on node A to actor B on node B. Under normal circumstances, both &quot;at most once&quot; and &quot;at least once&quot; will have a 100% success rate. But if I shutdown node B in the middle of the test run, the &quot;at most once&quot; application will start having network timeout errors and some messages will fail. Whereas, the &quot;at least once&quot; version will save all messages to persistence once sent. I could actually shutdown both node A and node B, wait a month, turn them back on and the system would recover and all messages would have been delivered.\r\n\r\nThe key thing to understand is that it&#39;s not as if the messaging protocol is inherently unreliable: there&#39;s no &quot;how many messages will ordinarily fail&quot; because messages don&#39;t fail under ordinary circumstances even in &quot;at most once&quot;. If your hardware is 100% reliable and your network is 100% reliable and your software is 100% reliable, then  your messages will be delivered 100% of the time with either approach.
