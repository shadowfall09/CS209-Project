Does it mean in the beginning or by a distance? \r\n\r\nIn general, &quot;offset&quot; means some form of distance measured from some given position.  The position could be the beginning of ... something ... but it isn&#39;t necessarily.\r\n\r\nWhat &quot;offset&quot; specifically means will depend on the context in which it is used.  (Ideally, the meaning will be *evident* from the context.)\r\n\r\n---------------------  \r\n\r\n&gt; What does the `String.offsetByCodePoints(int index, int codePointOffset)` method do? \r\n\r\nThis method calculates the position of a specific `char` within the `String`.  The `char` will be the first char of the Unicode codepoint that is `codePointOffset` codepoints after the position given by `index`.\r\n\r\n(So, in this context &quot;offset&quot; is referring a distance measured in Unicode code points from the position of a given code unit.)\r\n\r\nBoth `index` and the result are normal string index values; i.e. they are `char` positions.\r\n\r\nThe point ... is that when you are treating a `String` as sequence of Unicode codepoints, your code needs to take account of the fact that a codepoint may consist of either 1 or 2 `char` values.\r\n\r\n**To understand what the above all means, you may need to do some background reading on Unicode, codepoints and codeunits, and also on UTF-16 and how Java models Unicode strings.**\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n&gt; What does &quot;unpaired surrogates&quot; in the method documentation mean?\r\n\r\nJava strings represent characters that are Unicode code-points &gt; 65535 as UTF-16 surrogate characters.  In a well-formed UTF-16 string, the surrogates come in pairs, representing respectively the high and low order bits of the Unicode code-point.  \r\n\r\nThe sentence is saying is that if a `String` contains surrogates that are not properly paired, it will treat them as separate codepoints ... for the purpose of counting code points.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5903008/what-is-a-surrogate-pair-in-java","title":"What does &quot;offset&quot; mean in the context of programming?","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>What does &quot;offset&quot; mean in the context of programming?

(Ideally, the meaning will be <em>evident</em> from the context.)</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>What does the <code>String.offsetByCodePoints(int index, int codePointOffset)</code> method do?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This method calculates the position of a specific <code>char</code> within the <code>String</code>.  The <code>char</code> will be the first char of the Unicode codepoint that is <code>codePointOffset</code> codepoints after the position given by <code>index</code>.</p>\n<p>(So, in this context &quot;offset&quot; is referring a distance measured in Unicode code points from the position of a given code unit.)</p>\n<p>Both <code>index</code> and the result are normal string index values; i.e. they are <code>char</code> positions.</p>\n<p>The point ... is that when you are treating a <code>String</code> as sequence of Unicode codepoints, your code needs to take account of the fact that a codepoint may consist of either 1 or 2 <code>char</code> values.</p>\n<p><strong>To understand what the above all means, you may need to do some background reading on Unicode, codepoints and codeunits, and also on UTF-16 and how Java models Unicode strings.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>What does &quot;unpaired surrogates&quot; in the method documentation mean?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Java strings represent characters that are Unicode code-points &gt; 65535 as UTF-16 surrogate characters.  In a well-formed UTF-16 string, the surrogates come in pairs, representing respectively the high and low order bits of the Unicode code-point.</p>\n<p>The sentence is saying is that if a <code>String</code> contains surrogates that are not properly paired, it will treat them as separate codepoints ... for the purpose of counting code points.</p>\n<p>See also: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5903008/what-is-a-surrogate-pair-in-java\">What is a &quot;surrogate pair&quot; in Java?</a></p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":10131623,"reputation":332,"user_id":7484811,"display_name":"Maged Almaweri"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1611466051,"creation_date":1611466051,"answer_id":65867432,"question_id":3971598,"body_markdown":"As per Wikipedia  [Offset (computer science)][1]\r\n \r\nAn offset within an array or other data structure object is an integer indicating the distance (displacement) between the beginning of the object and a given element or point, presumably within the same object.

Perhaps I need to change my run configuration?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","elasticsearch","cratedb"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":19656819,"reputation":216,"user_id":14389269,"display_name":"proddata"},"score":0,"creation_date":1641730162,"post_id":70640628,"comment_id":124876998,"body_markdown":"Did you update CrateDB to a newer version?

Checking if you already have Java installed\r\n\r\n&gt; You can check if you have Java installed by running ```java --version```\r\n&gt; in the terminal. The output should be something like this: \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt; openjdk 17.0.1 2021-10-19\r\n&gt; OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.1+12-39)\r\n&gt; OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.1+12-39, mixed mode, sharing)\r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt; If you get an output similar to this (note that you can have a\r\n&gt; different version installed), then proceed to **Step 3.**  \r\n&gt; If you get\r\n&gt; an error that probably means you don&#39;t have Java installed and you\r\n&gt; need to install it. (**go the next step**)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 2. Installing/Downloading Java\r\n\r\n&gt; You can find the Java SDK for downloading [here][1].  \r\n&gt; Click on **JDK 17**.  \r\n&gt; From **Builds** choose and download the appropriate version for you system.  \r\n&gt; Save it somewhere on your system.

I have no idea what `module-info.java` is or does.\r\n&gt; &gt; 2. When I used the CLI to compile the code generated by IntelliJ for a JavaFX project, it failed at runtime (more specifically, at loading the FXML) because it seems that it can only find it inside the `out` folder (I tested it using *getClass().getResource()* and *getClass().getClassLoader().getResource()*)  \r\n&gt; &gt; In order to fix this you can \r\n&gt; &gt; move/copy the .fxml file somewhere in the `out` folder and set the proper path for the FXMLLoader inside the code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://jdk.java.net/\r\n  [2]: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/\r\n  [3]: https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#install-javafx\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/cCz3l.png\r\n","title":"How to compile a Java source code (using javac 11.0.13) that uses JavaFx on a Linux machine?","body":"<p>I thought JavaFX came together with Java SDK but that doesn't seem to be the case since JDK 11.<br />\nIn order to compile and run JavaFX apps, the JavaFX SDK (which no longer comes together with the Java SDK) is required.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>These are the steps required to follow in order to be able to compile and run JavaFX apps:</p>\n<p>Step 1.
