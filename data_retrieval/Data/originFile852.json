So, if `User` contains the `CustomerID` you&#39;re after, just get it via `((User) env.getSource()).getCustomerId()`.

Think of topics as &quot;labels&quot; that events are sent on. Topics are used by the Solace PubSub+ Event Broker to decide which subscribers to route the event to. **Topics are not endpoints**, meaning that you do not create topics on the broker before sending a message. Topics are very dynamic which means you can send messages on as many topics as you&#39;d like (!) and the broker will mange the list of topic subscriptions. Since topics are not endpoints, think of them as metadata describing what you are publishing.\r\n\r\nThe best practice is to always publish messages on topics regardless what Message Exchange Pattern (MEP) you want to use: Direct vs. Guaranteed. If you are using a Guaranteed MEP in your application, then publish the message on a topic with a persistent flag set to true. \r\n\r\nUsing the Solace PubSub+ Messaging API for Java:\r\n- Publishing Direct messages: `DirectMessagePublisher publisher = messagingService.createDirectMessagePublisherBuilder()`\r\n\r\n- Publishing Guaranteed messages: `PersistentMessagePublisher publisher = messagingService.createPersistentMessagePublisherBuilder()`. \r\n\r\nNote that the persistent flag is automatically set when using the new Solace PubSub+ Messaging API.\r\n\r\n## From a Consumer perspective (MessageReceiverBuilder)\r\n\r\nDepending on your use-case, you have two options: \r\n\r\n1.

Note below the different types of queues. \r\n\r\nThink of queues on the Solace broker as nothing but another client that is subscribing to topics. Which means that you can add topic subscriptions to queues that attracts the messages you want, and any client that is bound to the queue will consume the messages in it. \r\n\r\n### Note on message promotion\r\n\r\nIf a Publisher publishes messages without setting the persistent flag on the message (i.e uses Direct MEP), what happens if a queue subscribes to the topic the message is sent on?

Can also be created by a client using a Messaging API.\r\n\r\n- Non-durable queue: Temporary queues and only created by the client and lasts for the duration of the Session.

In your given code, you only return if a certain condition is met. Otherwise, there is no return value. That&#39;s the issue with your code. \r\n\r\nOne thing you can do is to break the loop once your condition is met and then return at the end of the method.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static int wordCount(String sentence) {\r\n  int wc = 1;\r\n  for (int a = 0; a &lt;= sentence.length()-1; a++) {\r\n    if (sentence.charAt(a) == &#39; &#39;) {\r\n      wc += 1;\r\n    }\r\n    if (a == sentence.length()-1) {\r\n      break;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return wc;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in your code, you are checking the same condition twice.\r\n\r\nFirst, in your for loop, you are looping from `a = 0` to `a &lt;= sentence.length()-1`.\r\n\r\nYou can change it to this, to increase the readability of your code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfor (int a = 0; a &lt; sentence.length(); a++) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat this does is, you start your loop where `a = 0` and iterate until `a` is lesser than the length of the `sentence`. That is exactly same as &quot;until `a` is lesser than or equal to the (length of the `sentence` - `1`)&quot;. Check how the explanation of the code is also simpler here.\r\n\r\nThen inside your loop, you are checking whether `a == sentence.length() - 1` to return.

This whole MVP design is a bit confusing to me and I&#39;m trying my best to understand it and use the correct design structure but I think I am doing some things wrong. I also know that this code isn&#39;t very optimal with me drawing colored squares to artificially clear the maze or that I have a boolean in the render for the solving of the maze but I don&#39;t know what else to do as of now. \r\n\r\nThank you so much for taking a look and leaving any comments below it means a lot to me. I will continue to do research and try new things as this question is active and if I make any progress I will leave updates.","title":"How do I animate a draw call in android studio from the presenter?","body":"<h1>Issue</h1>\n<p>I have a project that I am writing where I have a maze that is randomly created with one button and and I can solve the maze with another button. The issue I am having is that I currently have the solution path drawn all at once in the presenter and then the solve method in the presenter is called in the DrawingView and is activated through a button on the MainActivity. I want each rect that I am drawing in the presenter (render) method to draw with timed pauses in between them. This is my first time using the MVP design and I have done a bunch of research on this and I am just struggling a lot to run methods that don't have the canvas passed to them.</p>\n<p>As a warning I did get rid of the imports of the classes to try to cut down a bit.</p>\n<h2>Drawing View</h2>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>class DrawingView extends View implements DrawingContract.DrawingCanvas {\n\n    private final DrawingContract.DrawingPresenter drawingPresenter;\n\n    public DrawingView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {\n        super(context, attrs);\n\n        drawingPresenter = new Presenter(this);\n    }\n\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {\n        super.onDraw(canvas);\n        drawingPresenter.render(canvas);\n    }\n\n    public void generateNewMaze() {\n        drawingPresenter.createMaze();\n        postInvalidate();\n    }\n\n    public void solveAndPrintMazePath() {\n        drawingPresenter.solveMaze();\n        postInvalidate();\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Presenter</h2>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class Presenter implements DrawingContract.DrawingPresenter{\n    DrawingContract.DrawingCanvas view;\n\n    //boolean for the maze path to be drawn\n    private boolean mazeIsSolved;\n\n    //2d array for maze and start/exit cells\n    private Cell[][] cells;\n    private Cell start, exit;\n\n    //Static variables for columns, rows and thickness of cell walls\n    private static final int COLS = 10, ROWS = 10;\n    private static final float WALL_THICKNESS = 4;\n\n    //Cell sizes and screen margins\n    private float cellSize, hMargin, vMargin;\n\n    //Paints\n    private Paint wallPaint, startPaint, exitPaint, cellPaint;\n\n    //Random for the maze generation\n    private Random random;\n\n    //Graph\n    private Graph mazeGraph;\n\n    //Depth first object to solve the maze\n    private DepthFirst myDFS;\n\n    public Presenter(DrawingContract.DrawingCanvas v) {\n        //Set the view\n        view = v;\n\n        //Set boolean to false so we don't draw solve path\n        mazeIsSolved = false;\n\n        //Create a new graph\n        mazeGraph = new Graph();\n\n        //Creating a paint for the walls\n        wallPaint = new Paint();\n        wallPaint.setColor(Color.WHITE);\n        wallPaint.setStrokeWidth(WALL_THICKNESS);\n\n        //Creating the paint for the start of the maze\n        startPaint = new Paint();\n        startPaint.setColor(Color.GREEN);\n\n        //Creating the paint for the exit of the maze\n        exitPaint = new Paint();\n        exitPaint.setColor(Color.BLUE);\n\n        //Creating the cell paint\n        cellPaint = new Paint();\n        cellPaint.setColor(Color.BLACK);\n\n        //Random for maze generation\n        random = new Random();\n\n        //Creating the DFS\n        myDFS = new DepthFirst();\n\n        //Creating an initial maze\n        createMaze();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void render(Canvas canvas) {\n        canvas.drawColor(Color.BLACK);\n\n        int width = canvas.getWidth();\n        int height = canvas.getHeight();\n\n        if(width/height &lt;

This is used by default for `CsvToBeanBuilder`:\r\n\r\n&gt; This builder is intelligent enough to guess the **mapping strategy** according to the following strategy:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 1. If a mapping strategy is explicitly set, it is always used.\r\n&gt; 2. If CsvBindByPosition or CsvCustomBindByPosition is present, ColumnPositionMappingStrategy is used.\r\n&gt; 3. Otherwise, `HeaderColumnNameMappingStrategy` is used. This includes the case when `CsvBindByName` or `CsvCustomBindByName` are being used. The\r\n&gt; annotations will automatically be recognized.\r\n\r\nInternally, the class [`HeaderColumnNameMappingStrategy`][3] will call `registerBinding(..)`.
