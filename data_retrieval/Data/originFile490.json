You can change types to double whenever you want by using <code>mapToDouble()</code> instead <code>mapToInt()</code></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":28352837,"reputation":1,"user_id":21684040,"display_name":"Joe Black"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":86,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1681934505,"creation_date":1681929437,"question_id":76057835,"body_markdown":"how to use the api stream to find the average grade in a given subject for all students?\r\nAllow in Hashmap&lt;String, String &gt; map\r\n\r\nFor example: `key: &quot;Ann&quot;, value: &quot;Physics 3.5 Math 4.0 History 2.5&quot;`\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Student {\r\n\r\n    private String name;\r\n    private Map&lt;String, List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; marks;\r\n\r\n\r\n    public Student(String name, Map&lt;String, List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; marks) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n        this.marks = marks;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getName() {\r\n        return name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public Map&lt;String, List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; getMarks() {\r\n        return marks;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\r\n        Map&lt;String, List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; markAnn = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n        markAnn.put(&quot;Physics&quot;, List.of(4, 4, 5));\r\n        markAnn.put(&quot;Mathematics&quot;, List.of(2, 3, 4));\r\n        markAnn.put(&quot;History&quot;, List.of(3, 3, 3));\r\n\r\n        Map&lt;String, List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; markKate = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n        markKate.put(&quot;Physics&quot;, List.of(1, 2, 3));\r\n        markKate.put(&quot;Mathematics&quot;, List.of(5, 5, 3));\r\n        markKate.put(&quot;History&quot;, List.of(4, 2, 5));\r\n\r\n        Student[] students = {new Student(&quot;Ann&quot;, markAnn),\r\n                new Student(&quot;Kate&quot;, markKate)\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","title":"search for the average via streamapi","body":"<p>how to use the api stream to find the average grade in a given subject for all students?\nAllow in Hashmap&lt;String, String &gt; map</p>\n<p>For example: <code>key: &quot;Ann&quot;, value: &quot;Physics 3.5 Math 4.0 History 2.5&quot;</code></p>\n<pre><code>class Student {\n\n    private String name;\n    private Map&lt;String, List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; marks;\n\n\n    public Student(String name, Map&lt;String, List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; marks) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.marks = marks;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public Map&lt;String, List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; getMarks() {\n        return marks;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        Map&lt;String, List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; markAnn = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n        markAnn.put(&quot;Physics&quot;, List.of(4, 4, 5));\n        markAnn.put(&quot;Mathematics&quot;, List.of(2, 3, 4));\n        markAnn.put(&quot;History&quot;, List.of(3, 3, 3));\n\n        Map&lt;String, List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; markKate = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n        markKate.put(&quot;Physics&quot;, List.of(1, 2, 3));\n        markKate.put(&quot;Mathematics&quot;, List.of(5, 5, 3));\n        markKate.put(&quot;History&quot;, List.of(4, 2, 5));\n\n        Student[] students = {new Student(&quot;Ann&quot;, markAnn),\n                new Student(&quot;Kate&quot;, markKate)\n        };\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","ssl-certificate","version","sdkman"],"owner":{"account_id":21184435,"reputation":97,"user_id":15578125,"display_name":"Reed M"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":102,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1681934477,"creation_date":1681934477,"question_id":76058398,"body_markdown":"I am trying to add some certs to my java cacerts file, but am consistently getting the error `PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target`, suggesting that the root certs (which I know are correct) are not being read properly.\r\n\r\nThe location where I&#39;m adding the certs is `~/.sdkman/candidates/java/current/jre/lib/security/cacerts`.

There is a difference in the Spring versions in the `org.springframework.core.annotation.RepeatableContainers` class (rows 169 and 170 in `computeRepeatedAnnotationsMethod` method in particular) that seems to make the difference. \r\n\r\nNow i&#39;m confused: is my code (the `MyApiDocumentation`) incorrect but accidentally worked because of Spring bug that was fixed in 5.3.25 or did Spring introduce bug, and in any case is there a good fix to my code (other than just remove the composed `@MyApiDocumentation` and use both `@Operation` and `@ApiResponses` directly in every place)?","title":"AnnotationConfigurationException - annotation with @Repeatable value not considered meta-present - after Spring Core 5.3.24 -&gt; 5.3.25 upgrade","body":"<p>I have the following

related to the return value <code>ApiResponse</code> being a <code>@Repeatable(ApiResponses.class)</code> annotation.

Either that or maybe even rather just use the original coordinates and try to find the closest available streetview to those coordinates?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","split"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":233608,"reputation":26927,"user_id":499214,"display_name":"John Dvorak"},"score":0,"creation_date":1355385905,"post_id":13855466,"comment_id":19075758,"body_markdown":"Why not use a JSON parser as you should?","body":"Why not use a JSON parser as you should?"},{"owner":{"account_id":1439522,"reputation":9489,"user_id":1360074,"accept_rate":85,"display_name":"Nikolay Kuznetsov"},"score":2,"creation_date":1355385960,"post_id":13855466,"comment_id":19075775,"body_markdown":"`String.Split()` it does not exist.
