And since <code>method(String)</code> isn't overriding, we have <code>method(Object)</code> of the parent, hence, it's the one chosen for execution.</p>\n<p>We then override the method to break this rule, and this is how the JVM called <code>ChildClass.method(Object)</code> even if the reference variable is of a parent class.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":137777,"reputation":194868,"user_id":342235,"accept_rate":77,"display_name":"Freewind"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42610,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":11,"accepted_answer_id":24884434,"answer_count":13,"score":11,"last_activity_date":1657798107,"creation_date":1406022761,"question_id":24884151,"body_markdown":"Java code:\r\n\r\n    class P {\r\n        public void hello() {}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    class C extends P {\r\n        public void hello(String s) {}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMy question is: Is the `hello` in class `C` overloading the one with same name in super class `P`?\r\n\r\nMy friend says they are not because the are not in the same class.

This can receive on any address (and over any interface) that works in your OS.\r\n\r\n* `LocateRegistry.getRegistry(String[,int])` connects to whatever address or name (resolved to an address) you specify; `([int])` calls `InetAddress.getLocalHost()` which dispatches to `getLocalHostName()` in `Inet4AddressImp` or `Inet6AddressImpl` depending on your JVM as above, but in either case that is a native method with implementation depending on your OS which for Unix including Linux is [here](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/java.base/unix/native/libnet/Inet4AddressImpl.c#L61) or [here](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/java.base/unix/native/libnet/Inet6AddressImpl.c#L62). As you can see these are identical and thus it always calls [`gethostname()`](https://linux.die.net/man/2/gethostname) which should return the same value the `hostname` progam (with no options) displays; if the call fails (returns nonzero) Java substitutes the literal string `&quot;localhost&quot;`. That name is then resolved, typically by a host file and/or DNS but may vary depending on the OS and configuration; on a properly configured system `gethostname()` will be a name that resolves to a valid address of the machine (displayed by `hostname -i`), while `localhost` is special-cased to always give the loopback address (for the IP version) which is a valid address only when used on the same machine i.e. not really RMI. (A properly configured OS also resolves localhost to loopback, but Java does so here even if the OS doesn&#39;t.) Note that none of these look at the addresses actually existing on your interfaces (which `hostname -I` returns). \r\n\r\nThat connection, to the registry, worked fine. You say it&#39;s the `lookup` call that hangs, and that is trying to connect _to the remote service_. This relates to your second question about `registry.rebind(name, remoteobject)` -- but it&#39;s not the `rebind` (or `bind`) call that sets the location of the remoteobject, rather the remoteobject _already_ contains its location. You use a parameter `service` without showing where it comes from and particularly where it was created, and that&#39;s what matters, because such an object is created to contain a [`LiveRef`](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/java.rmi/share/classes/sun/rmi/transport/LiveRef.java) which in turn creates and contains a [`TCPEndpoint`](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/java.rmi/share/classes/sun/rmi/transport/tcp/TCPEndpoint.java) which contains the name or address to be used to connect it.\r\n\r\nNow the code in `TCPEndpoint` which determines that name or address is a bit complicated. The simple case is that if sysprop `java.rmi.server.hostname` is set, that is used -- and can be either a resolvable name _or_ an address in string form. Otherwise it calls `InetAddress.getLocalHost()` as described above for `getRegistry` and by default it uses the resulting _address_, but if sysprop `java.rmi.server.useLocalHostName` is set `true` it uses the name (i.e. from `gethostname()`) except if the name doesn&#39;t contain a dot (doesn&#39;t &#39;look like&#39; a DNS name) it attempts reverse resolution on the address and if successful uses _that_ name; it&#39;s not quite clear to me what happens if that fails, and I can&#39;t easily test right now. \r\n\r\nSo the simple answer to your problem, but not your question, is use `java.rmi.server.hostname` to specify a name or address that the client(s) should use to reach your server. \r\n","title":"which hostname or ip is java rmi bind in linux?","body":"<p>TLDR: <strong>it's not the registry</strong></p>\n<p>To get your first and third questions out of the way</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>the registry created by <code>LocateRegistry.createRegistry</code> (like the one created by running the <code>JRE/bin/registry[.exe]</code> <em>program</em>) listens on 0.0.0.0 for IPv4 and/or ::0 for IPv6 depending on your JVM config.

The actual reasoning is:\r\n\r\n  1. You are using passwords for security.\r\n\r\n  2. A bad guy may be able to get a memory dump of a running JVM ... or extract a partial dump from the disk blocks that hold (or held) the JVM&#39;s memory pages.  That dump may contain passwords in clear text.\r\n  \r\n  3. To mitigate this, one can (should) overwrite the memory containing the passwords when they are no longer required.\r\n\r\n  4. It is hard to overwrite a `String` since it is immutable.\r\n\r\nBut if you examine each of those points, there are assumptions that can be questioned.\r\n\r\n  1.  Passwords are not a good way of implementing security.  For high grade security you should be using public/private key or secret key authentication.  So either you are talking about passwords that are &quot;less important&quot; to your system ... or you have a bigger problem than the one you are trying to address here.\r\n\r\n  2.  If the bad guy can read JVM memory or the page file, they are pretty deep into your infrastructure.  You are already fatally compromised.  Furthermore, if they are in this deep, they can most likely find other ways to steal the passwords; e.g. stealing your SSL Cert&#39;s private key and snooping / decoding the encrypted network traffic.\r\n\r\n  3.  This is only a mitigation:\r\n\r\n      - The passwords will be in the clear in the `char[]` for a period.\r\n      - Before the passwords arrive at your code, they will most likely have been converted to `String` objects by the servlet stack (or whatever framework you use).  \r\n      - Besides, this mitigation is only effective if you *do* overwrite the content of the `char[]` in your code after using it.\r\n\r\n  4.  In fact, if you are really worried about this, it is possible to use reflection to erase a String; i.e. to mutate a `String` object.  In general, this is a dangerous thing to do.  For passwords / password checking, this might be acceptable.\r\n\r\nIn short,  I would argue that using `char[]` instead of `String` is too expensive to implement in Java .... unless you are prepared to completely re-engineer your web framework.  Furthermore, the benefit of doing this debatable, given the other ways that someone with deep access could steal the passwords.   \r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nNow to your specific question:\r\n\r\n&gt;  Is it safe to do `.add(&quot;password&quot;, new String(password))`\r\n\r\nIf you consider it to be risky to use a `String` for a password, then that code doesn&#39;t help.  In fact, assuming that `password` is a `String` you now have two `String` objects in memory that contain the password text.\r\n\r\n - If the API you are using requires you to provide the password as a `String` you have a problem.  \r\n\r\n - If the source of the password (i.e. how you get it from the user interface, servlet framework, whatever) is a `String`, you have a problem.\r\n\r\n - Both cases it will be necessary to rework aspects of the code that you are interacting with to solve the problem.  This may be difficult.\r\n\r\nAnd:\r\n\r\n&gt; I know it&#39;s probably bad that the web api is just accepting a password as it is instead of accepting a base64 version or whatever.\r\n\r\nBase64 won&#39;t slow the bad guy down for more than a minute or so.  Ditto for any reversible encoding.  But I hope that you are insisting that the password only be sent over SSL / TLS secured connections.","title":"For security, is it safe to pass new String(char[]) as an argument for passwords to a method that only accepts string as parameter?","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>I've read that for passwords, it's more ideal to use <code>char[]</code> since <code>Strings</code> are immutable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's not the (whole) reason.

Furthermore, the benefit of doing this debatable, given the other ways that someone with deep access could steal the passwords.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Now to your specific question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it safe to do <code>.add(&quot;password&quot;, new String(password))</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you consider it to be risky to use a <code>String</code> for a password, then that code doesn't help.  In fact, assuming that <code>password</code> is a <code>String</code> you now have two <code>String</code> objects in memory that contain the password text.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>If the API you are using requires you to provide the password as a <code>String</code> you have a problem.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If the source of the password (i.e. how you get it from the user interface, servlet framework, whatever) is a <code>String</code>, you have a problem.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Both cases it will be necessary to rework aspects of the code that you are interacting with to solve the problem.  This may be difficult.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I know it's probably bad that the web api is just accepting a password as it is instead of accepting a base64 version or whatever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Base64 won't slow the bad guy down for more than a minute or so.  Ditto for any reversible encoding.  But I hope that you are insisting that the password only be sent over SSL / TLS secured connections.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":10581293,"reputation":344,"user_id":7794994,"display_name":"Yavuz Tas"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1547438890,"creation_date":1547438890,"answer_id":54175679,"question_id":54175287,"body_markdown":"No matter how you try on client side it does not matter about security because it seems a simple http client depending on your code in the post.

I have a setup like one below:</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity\nclass TopLevelEntity {\n\n    @EmbeddedId\n    private TopLevelEntityId id;\n\n    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;mid_level_entity_id&quot;)\n    private MidLevelEntity midLevelEntity;\n\n    @Column(name = &quot;some_number&quot;)\n    private Integer someNumber;\n\n}\n\n@Entity\nclass MidLevelEntity {\n\n    @EmbeddedId\n    private MidLevelEntityId id;\n\n    @OneToOne(mappedBy = &quot;midLevelEntity&quot;, cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\n    private BottomLevelEntityId bottomLevelEntityId;\n\n}\n\n@Entity\nclass BottomLevelEntity {\n\n    @EmbeddedId\n    private BottomLevelEntityId id;\n\n    @OneToOne\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;mid_level_entity_id&quot;)\n    private MidLevelEntityId midLevelEntityId;\n\n}\n\ninterface TopLevelEntityProjection {\n\n    TopLevelEntityId getTopLevelEntityId();\n\n    @Value(&quot;#{target.midLevelEntity?.id}&quot;)\n    MidLevelEntityId getMidLevelEntityId();\n\n}\n\n@Repository\npublic interface TopLevelEntityRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;TopLevelEntity, TopLevelEntityId&gt; {\n\n    @EntityGraph(attributePaths = {&quot;midLevelEntity.id&quot;}, type = EntityGraph.EntityGraphType.FETCH)\n    @Query(&quot;select e from TopLevelEntity e where e.someNumber &gt; :someNumber&quot;)\n    Page&lt;TopLevelEntityProjection&gt; findTopLevelEntitiesWithSomeNumberGreaterThanSomeOtherNumber(Integer someNumber, Pageable pageable);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>First query that is being executed is fine -- it fetches top and mid level entities. However there is also a query for each of the bottom level entities -- they are lazily loaded even though they are not really used for anything. We could of course eagerly load bottom level entities to avoid multiple queries, but is there a way to skip those altogether?</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n<p>I can now see that this question can be simplified: same thing happens if I query MidLevelEntities directly. Despite projection not using BottomLevelEntities they are being lazily loaded anyway. At first I though that maybe that are accessed during some equals/hashCode call, but when I overriden the methods and setup a breakpoints in them, they were not called.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","mongock"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":17889056,"reputation":1273,"user_id":12995983,"display_name":"Mongock team"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1655723865,"creation_date":1655723865,"answer_id":72686296,"question_id":72676815,"body_markdown":"Mongock currently no supports @value injection via field o method parameter.

This function actually converts the String to bytes which are sent one by one in lines so if I read it with a Python code from UART (because my BT module uses this type of communication) in and infinite loop as following:\r\n\r\n    while True:\r\n        while uart.any():\r\n             read_instruction = uart.readline().decode()\r\n\r\nI get an output like this:\r\n\r\n    2\r\n    5\r\n    5\r\n    \r\n    5\r\n    2\r\n    \r\n    2\r\n    \r\n    1\r\n\r\nThis is quite complex and annoying to process given the fact that I&#39;m just trying to control an LED strip over Bluetooth. I know there are many apps that can do all that but I want to learn and make one myself. I&#39;ve searched Google and YT for many hours and all the guys there are using a code that is giving just a simple instruction such as 1 = do something, 2 = do something else and this is quite easy to program. But as I have already mentioned BT is used to send much more complex data or even play music, so where is the catch?

To simplify the task will have only one previous task as a dependency.\r\n 2. The finish date of the previous task is the start date of the current task.\r\n 3. To calculate the dates, you need to go through all the dependent tasks until you reach the task where the `isDependent` field is set to `false`.\r\n\r\n**My

Then play around with the code to see what works and what doesn&#39;t."},{"owner":{"account_id":9463219,"reputation":9357,"user_id":7036419,"display_name":"Maurice Perry"},"score":1,"creation_date":1657780628,"post_id":72975943,"comment_id":128892742,"body_markdown":"@ScaryWombat not if it&#39;s a local variable.","body":"@ScaryWombat not if it&#39;s a local variable."},{"owner":{"account_id":2673407,"reputation":44640,"user_id":2310289,"display_name":"Scary Wombat"},"score":0,"creation_date":1657782261,"post_id":72975943,"comment_id":128893241,"body_markdown":"@MauricePerry If it is a local variable, then according to my IDE it will not compile, due to being un-initialized.","body":"@MauricePerry If it is a local variable, then according to my IDE it will not compile, due to being un-initialized."},{"owner":{"account_id":9463219,"reputation":9357,"user_id":7036419,"display_name":"Maurice Perry"},"score":0,"creation_date":1657782469,"post_id":72975943,"comment_id":128893310,"body_markdown":"@ScaryWombat to be precise, it would not compile it the variable was used before it&#39;s initialized.","body":"@ScaryWombat to be precise, it would not compile it the variable was used before it&#39;s initialized."},{"owner":{"account_id":2673407,"reputation":44640,"user_id":2310289,"display_name":"Scary Wombat"},"score":0,"creation_date":1657782999,"post_id":72975943,"comment_id":128893483,"body_markdown":"@MauricePerry - You are correct, I was being very imprecise ;-)","body":"@MauricePerry - You are correct, I was being very imprecise ;-)"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":22755735,"reputation":555,"user_id":16915219,"display_name":"JumperBot_"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1657784525,"creation_date":1657781686,"answer_id":72976390,"question_id":72975943,"body_markdown":"**First Question:**\r\n\r\n 1. If the variable is declared outside a function, constructor,  initializer block or similar (method in particular), then that variable is stored by the class it is written into.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    public class Main {\r\n      protected int number=1; //I&#39;m outside a method!\r\n      public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        //Some stuff...\r\n      }\r\n      public String outsideMethod=&quot;I&#39;m outside a method!&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n 3. If the variable is declared in a method, then that variable is local and will be reduced to rubble after the method has completed its execution.\r\n```java\r\n    public class Main {\r\n      public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        String value=&quot;I&#39;m gonna get obliterated by the garbage collector later!&quot;;\r\n        //Some moments later...\r\n        value=&quot;Goodbye, see you at the other side of the garbage collector.&quot;;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Second Question:**\r\n\r\n 1. You can refer to a class&#39;s member variables if they aren&#39;t set to `private` except if it&#39;s a `nested class`, you can take variables made by the parent class even if it&#39;s private!\r\n\r\n 2. You can refer to a class&#39;s variable in two ways.\r\n\r\n 3. First is statically, that&#39;s if a variable is declared to be `static`. Static means it stays in the memory longer, hence a &quot;bad hog&quot;, a feature loved and hated by many.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic /*or protected*/ static int number=100; //inside class named MyClass.\r\n//Somewhere outside the class...\r\nMyClass.number //access static variable statically.\r\n```\r\n\r\n 4. Second is by initializing an `instance` of the object/class.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic /*or protected*/ int number=100;\r\n//Somewhere outside the class...\r\nMyClass classy=new MyClass(...);\r\nclassy.number; //access variable by using an instance of the object.\r\n```\r\n 5. I forgot, you can also access them somewhere inside the class they were declared in!\r\n```java\r\nfinal String lmao=&quot;lol&quot;;\r\nString im_an_empty_string;\r\npublic static void main(String[] a) {\r\n  im_an_empty_string=lmao;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Others:**\r\n\r\n 1. If you don&#39;t know, final variables are var(s) that can&#39;t be changed no matter what.\r\n\r\n 2. The JVM optimizes operations with final var(s) by doing the operations in the memory itself! (A.K.A. statically.)\r\n\r\n 3. Lastly, don&#39;t worry about memory allocation! Java knows what it&#39;s doing.\r\n\r\n 4. Not unless you run out of physical memory and it throws an OOME.\r\n\r\n 5. OOME = OutOfMemoryException     P.S. It&#39;s an error that can&#39;t really be caught nicely.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThanks for the additional info for Question 1&amp;2, no. 1 [@user16320675](https://stackoverflow.com/users/16320675/user16320675)!","title":"When just declaring objects, it locates in stack?","body":"<p><strong>First Question:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>If the variable is declared outside a function, constructor,  initializer block or similar (method in particular), then that variable is stored by the class it is written into.</li>\n</ol>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>    public class Main {\n      protected int number=1; //I'm outside a method!\n      public static void main(String[] args) {\n        //Some stuff...\n      }\n      public String outsideMethod=&quot;I'm outside a method!&quot;;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>If the variable is declared in a method, then that variable is local and will be reduced to rubble after the method has completed its execution.</li>\n</ol>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>    public class Main {\n      public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String value=&quot;I'm gonna get obliterated by the garbage collector later!&quot;;\n        //Some moments later...\n        value=&quot;Goodbye, see you at the other side of the garbage collector.&quot;;\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Second Question:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>You can refer to a class's member variables if they aren't set to <code>private</code> except if it's a <code>nested class</code>, you can take variables made by the parent class even if it's private!</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You can refer to a class's variable in two ways.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>First is statically, that's if a variable is declared to be <code>static</code>.
