The Tab10 appears to run at USB v1 speeds although it has a USB v2 micro-B socket. The Miix has a type A USB socket and does not need an OTG converter. I know of three methods:\r\n1. Use Libusb. This requires a separate compilation and build in Android Studio to a shared library. Write C++ code to setup, transfer packets and teardown the webcam. Write Java code for the user interface, decompress MJPEG, display preview and write JPEGs to storage. Connect the two via JNI. The C++ and Java run in separate threads but are non blocking. The inefficiency is in memcopying from a native image frame array to a JNI array and then freeing for garbage collection after each frame. Android apps run in a container, which means a special startup for Libusb and some functions fail, probably because of selinux violations.\r\n2. Use JNA to wrap the Libc libray.

However, **the for-each loop can only be used to cycle through the collection in the forward direction and you won&#39;t be able to modify the elements in this collection**. But, if all you want is to read the elements data, then it&#39;s very simple and thanks to Java lambda expression it&#39;s often one liner. For example:\r\n\r\n    iterableElements.forEach (x -&gt; System.out.println(x) );\r\n\r\n**Iterator**\r\n\r\nThis interface enables you to iterate over a collection, obtaining and removing its elements. Each of the collection classes provides a **iterator()** method that returns an iterator to the start of the collection. The advantage of this interface over iterable is that with this interface **you can add, modify or remove elements in a collection**. But, accessing elements needs a little more code than iterable. For example:\r\n\r\n    for (Iterator i = c.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {\r\n           Element e = i.next();    //Get the element\r\n           System.out.println(e);    //access or modify the element\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**Sources:**\r\n\r\n 1.

However, <strong>the for-each loop can only be used to cycle through the collection in the forward direction and you won't be able to modify the elements in this collection</strong>. But, if all you want is to read the elements data, then it's very simple and thanks to Java lambda expression it's often one liner. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>iterableElements.forEach (x -&gt; System.out.println(x) );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Iterator</strong></p>\n\n<p>This interface enables you to iterate over a collection, obtaining and removing its elements.

However, the `entity_a_id` field in `entity_b_audit` is *always* null.\r\n\r\nSome details:\r\n\r\n 1. If I do not have the `@NotAudited` in `EntityA`, I will get an error that says something to the effect of: The table `EntityA_EntityB_audit` does not exist. This seems like it&#39;s trying to audit them as a single table, which I do not want.\r\n\r\n2. I have tried applying `@Audited(targetAuditMode = elationTargetAuditMode.NOT_AUDITED)` to each side. If applied only in `EntityA`, I get the above error. If applied only in `EntityB`, nothing changes. If applied in both, I get the error above. If applied to neither, I get the error above.\r\n\r\n3. I suspect the `entity_a_id` is null in `entity_b_audit` because the id isn&#39;t generated until EntityA hits the DB. `entity_a_id` is auto-incrementing in the `entity_a` table.\r\n\r\n4.

So, in order to get the correct value you need to configure metadataExtractorRegistry.

This causes the swagger UI to display duplicate endpoints:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iEK1G.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iEK1G.png\" alt=\"duplicate swagger-ui endpoints\" /></a></p>\n<p>I would like to have both the api tag name and the controller tag name to be &quot;academic degrees&quot;</p>\n<p>How can I avoid these duplicates and how can I control the tag name defined in the api decorator?</p>\n<p>I have tried to remove the tags from the spec and this causes no tags on the individual endpoints but only on the api. The api class then takes the name &quot;EducationApi&quot; from the paths defined.\nI want to avoid this because I have many endpoints in this spec and want to group them with tags in order to have the swagger-ui nice and neat.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","firebase","firebase-realtime-database"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":6819231,"reputation":132861,"user_id":5246885,"accept_rate":78,"display_name":"Alex Mamo"},"score":0,"creation_date":1675336085,"post_id":75321757,"comment_id":132908716,"body_markdown":"Aside from my answer, since you&#39;re using Java, I think that this [resource](https://medium.com/firebase-tips-tricks/how-to-filter-firestore-data-cheaper-705f5efec444) will help.

Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.\r\n\r\nThose &quot;collection view methods&quot; it mentions are the following:\r\n\r\n1. `HashMap#keySet()`, which returns a `Set&lt;K&gt;`.\r\n\r\n2. `HashMap#values()`, which returns a `Collection&lt;V&gt;`.\r\n\r\n3. `HashMap#entrySet()`, which returns a `Set&lt;Map.Entry&lt;K, V&gt;&gt;`.\r\n\r\n#### For-Each Loops\r\n\r\nIf you aren&#39;t aware, a for-each loop uses an `Iterator` behind the scenes. In other words, something like this:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\nList&lt;String&gt; list = List.of(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;);\r\nfor (String element : list) {\r\n    System.out.println(element);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs compiled down to:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\nList&lt;String&gt; list = List.of(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;);\r\nfor (Iterator&lt;String&gt; iterator = list.iterator(); iterator.hasNext(); ) {\r\n    String element = iterator.next();\r\n    System.out.println(element);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Your Code\r\n\r\nYou have a for-each loop iterating over the key set of your map. Inside this for-each loop you have a call to `put`, which is a structurally-modifying operation, on the same map.\r\n\r\n&gt; ```lang-java\r\n&gt; for (String key : letters.keySet()) {\r\n&gt;    if (!letters.containsKey(String.valueOf(input.charAt(i)))) {\r\n&gt;       letters.put(String.valueOf(input.charAt(i)),\r\n&gt;                   numberOfLettersInWord(input,input.charAt(i)));\r\n&gt;    } else continue;\r\n&gt;    System.out.println(letters);\r\n&gt; }\r\n&gt; ```\r\n\r\nThus, a `ConcurrentModificationException` is likely to be thrown. In your case it&#39;s all but guaranteed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nYou are apparently trying to count the frequencies of each letter in a string. This does not require you to loop over the key set of the map. The fact you don&#39;t actually use the `key` variable anywhere inside the for-each loop is a good indicator of this. This means you can simply get rid of the for-each loop and your code should work just fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\nMap&lt;String, Integer&gt; letters = new HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;();\r\nletters.put(String.valueOf(input.charAt(0)), numberOfLettersInWord(input,input.charAt(0)));\r\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; input.length(); i++) {\r\n    if (!letters.containsKey(String.valueOf(input.charAt(i)))) {\r\n        letters.put(String.valueOf(input.charAt(i)), numberOfLettersInWord(input,input.charAt(i)));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that call to `put` if the map does not already contain the key could be replaced with a call to [`computeIfAbsent`][3]. That method takes the key and a `Function` that computes the value if the key is not already contained in the map (or if the key is currently mapped to `null`). It would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\nMap&lt;String, Integer&gt; letters = new HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;();\r\nletters.put(String.valueOf(input.charAt(0)), numberOfLettersInWord(input,input.charAt(0)));\r\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; input.length(); i++) {\r\n    letters.computeIfAbsent(String.valueOf(input.charAt(i)), key -&gt; numberOfLettersInWord(input, key));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;_**Note:** The second argument the above `computeIfAbsent` call is a `Function` implemented via a [lambda expression][4]._&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\n## Potential Improvements\r\n\r\nThere may be a couple of improvements you could make to your code.\r\n\r\n### Change Key Type to Character\r\n\r\nGiven you&#39;re counting the frequency of _characters_, it would make sense to represent that in the code by using a `Map&lt;Character, Integer&gt;` instead of a `Map&lt;String, Integer&gt;`.\r\n\r\n### Count as You Go\r\n\r\nI can only assume that `numberOfLettersInWord` loops over the input string and counts how many times the given character occurs in said string. This means you loop over the string for each character in the string, resulting in an inefficient algorithm. Though you do have optimization where you only compute the frequency of a character if you haven&#39;t already done so for that character, so that improves things a little.\r\n\r\nHowever, you&#39;re already looping over all the characters in the input string. You might as well count the frequency of each character as you go. It could look something like:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\nString input = ...;\r\n\r\nMap&lt;Character, Integer&gt; frequencies = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; input.length(); i++) {\r\n    Character key = input.charAt(i);\r\n\r\n    Integer value = frequencies.get(key);\r\n    if (value == null) {\r\n        frequencies.put(key, 1);\r\n    } else {\r\n        frequencies.put(key, value + 1);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Use `compute` to Count\r\n\r\nThe body of that `for` loop can be replaced with a call to [`compute`][5]:\r\n\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\nString input = ...;\r\n\r\nMap&lt;Character, Integer&gt; frequencies = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; input.length(); i++) {\r\n    frequencies.compute(input.charAt(i), (key, value) -&gt; {\r\n        if (value == null) {\r\n            return 1;\r\n        } else {\r\n            return value + 1;\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that lambda expression (implementing a `BiFunction`) can be &quot;simplified&quot; even more:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\n(key, value) -&gt; value == null ? 1 : value + 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Use `merge` to Count\r\n\r\nAnother option is to use [`merge`][6]:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\nfrequencies.merge(input.charAt(i), 1, Integer::sum);\r\n```\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;_**Note:** The `Integer::sum` is a [method reference][7] implementing a `BiFunction`._&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashMap.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ConcurrentModificationException.html\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashMap.html#computeIfAbsent(K,java.util.function.Function)\r\n  [4]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html\r\n  [5]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashMap.html#compute(K,java.util.function.BiFunction)\r\n  [6]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashMap.html#merge(K,V,java.util.function.BiFunction)\r\n  [7]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methodreferences.html","title":"ConcurrentModificationException during putting new element into HashMap","body":"<h1>Why the ConcurrentModificationException?</h1>\n<p>You're getting a <code>ConcurrentModificationException</code> because you are structurally modifying the map while iterating its key set.</p>\n<h2>Documentation</h2>\n<p>Here's what <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashMap.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the documentation</a> of <code>HashMap</code> says on the subject:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The iterators returned by all of this class's &quot;collection view methods&quot; are <em>fail-fast</em>: if the map is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own <code>remove</code> method, the iterator will throw a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ConcurrentModificationException.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>ConcurrentModificationException</code></a>.

Can you explain why this happens and how to solve this?</p>\n<p>It supposed to have some more digit outputs after the <code>{a=4, b=4, c=3}</code> was shown but it ends with the exception (it is not really necessary, just an indicator where it stops working...)</p>\n<p>The word used in this run was <code>String input = &quot;aabbabcccba&quot;;</code></p>\n<p><code>numberOfLettersInWord</code> returns <code>Integer</code> value of how many times letter <code>input.charAt(i)</code> was found in word <code>input</code>(this works ok)</p>\n<p>line 2 in code fragment was used just to make the <code>HashMap</code> contain at least one line (null and empty checks already done by this moment and work well)</p>\n<p>I saw people had problems with <code>hashmap.remove()</code> in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/602636/why-is-a-concurrentmodificationexception-thrown-and-how-to-debug-it\">Why is a ConcurrentModificationException thrown and how to debug it</a> but I am not sure this is the same-same thing that can be solved with that answer.\nAlso I am not sure this answer is applicable for my case <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39921250/concurrentmodificationexception-hashmap\">ConcurrentModificationException - HashMap</a></p>\n"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":9542,"page":681,"page_size":100}
