Because all of this get resolved at compile time statically that is why **Method Overloading** is known as **Static Polymorphism** or **Static Binding**.\r\n\r\nBut bytecode for `anyMammal.speak()` and `humanMammal.speak()` is same (`invokevirtual #4`) because according to compiler both methods are called on `Mammal` reference.\r\n\r\nSo now the question comes if both method calls have same bytecode then how does JVM know which method to call?\r\n\r\nWell, the answer is hidden in the bytecode itself and it is `invokevirtual` instruction set. JVM uses the `invokevirtual` instruction to invoke Java equivalent of the C++ virtual methods. In C++ if we want to override one method in another class we need to declare it as virtual, But in Java, all methods are virtual by default because we can override every method in the child class (except private, final and static methods).\r\n\r\nIn Java, every reference variable holds two hidden pointers\r\n\r\n 1. A pointer to a table which again holds methods of the object and a pointer to the Class object. e.g. [speak(), speak(String) Class object]\r\n 2. A pointer to the memory allocated on the heap for that object’s data e.g. values of instance variables.\r\n\r\nSo all object references indirectly hold a reference to a table which holds all the method references of that object. Java has borrowed this concept from C++ and this table is known as virtual table (vtable).\r\n\r\nA vtable is an array like structure which holds virtual method names and their references on array indices. JVM creates only one vtable per class when it loads the class into memory.\r\n\r\nSo whenever JVM encounter with a `invokevirtual` instruction set, it checks the vtable of that class for the method reference and invokes the specific method which in our case is the method from a object not the reference.\r\n\r\nBecause all of this get resolved at runtime only and at runtime JVM gets to know which method to invoke, that is why **Method Overriding** is known as **Dynamic Polymorphism** or simply **Polymorphism** or **Dynamic Binding**.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can read it more details on my article [How Does JVM Handle Method Overloading and Overriding Internally][2].\r\n  \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/zo2QU.png\r\n  [2]: https://programmingmitra.com/2017/05/how-does-jvm-handle-method-overriding-internally.html","title":"Static Vs.

So, in order to fix this, we need to test for equality between the keys:</p>\n\n<pre><code>static &lt;K,V extends Comparable&lt;? super V&gt;&gt; SortedSet&lt;Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt;&gt; entriesSortedByValues(Map&lt;K,V&gt; map) {\n    SortedSet&lt;Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt;&gt; sortedEntries = new TreeSet&lt;Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt;&gt;(\n        new Comparator&lt;Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt;&gt;() {\n            @Override public int compare(Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt; e1, Map.Entry&lt;K,V&gt; e2) {\n                int res = e1.getValue().compareTo(e2.getValue());\n                if (e1.getKey().equals(e2.getKey())) {\n                    return res; // Code will now handle equality properly\n                } else {\n                    return res != 0 ? res : 1; // While still adding all entries\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    );\n    sortedEntries.addAll(map.entrySet());\n    return sortedEntries;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>\"Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set (whether or not an explicit comparator is provided) must be consistent with equals if the sorted set is to correctly implement the Set interface... the Set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation, but <strong>a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its compareTo (or compare) method, so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted set, equal</strong>.\"\n(<a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/SortedSet.html\">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/SortedSet.html</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Since we originally overlooked equality in order to force the set to add equal valued entries, now we have to test for equality in the keys in order for the set to actually return the entry you're looking for. This is kinda messy and definitely not how sets were intended to be used - but it works.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2311085,"reputation":149,"user_id":2029198,"display_name":"Hiro_Hamada"},"score":0,"creation_date":1664521166,"post_id":19671828,"comment_id":130494995,"body_markdown":"Can we use a hashmap instead of linkedhashmap for iterating over the map ?\nany pitfalls ?","body":"Can we use a hashmap instead of linkedhashmap for iterating over the map ? any pitfalls ?"},{"owner":{"account_id":1992310,"reputation":11172,"user_id":1786065,"accept_rate":91,"display_name":"Rogue"},"score":0,"creation_date":1668265486,"post_id":19671828,"comment_id":131365767,"body_markdown":"@Hiro_Hamada `HashMap` is inherently unordered, you can&#39;t really sort one of those.","body":"@Hiro_Hamada <code>HashMap</code> is inherently unordered, you can&#39;t really sort one of those."}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":108817,"reputation":111656,"user_id":288671,"display_name":"Vitalii Fedorenko"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":72,"is_accepted":false,"score":72,"last_activity_date":1634892116,"creation_date":1383093951,"answer_id":19671828,"question_id":2864840,"body_markdown":"In Java 8:\r\n\r\n    LinkedHashMap&lt;Integer, String&gt; sortedMap = map.entrySet().stream()\r\n      .sorted(Map.Entry.comparingByValue(/* Optional: Comparator.reverseOrder() */))\r\n      .collect(Collectors.toMap(Map.Entry::getKey,\r\n                                Map.Entry::getValue,\r\n                                (e1, e2) -&gt; e1, LinkedHashMap::new));\r\n","title":"TreeMap sort by value","body":"<p>In Java 8:</p>\n<pre><code>LinkedHashMap&lt;Integer, String&gt; sortedMap = map.entrySet().stream()\n  .sorted(Map.Entry.comparingByValue(/* Optional: Comparator.reverseOrder() */))\n  .collect(Collectors.toMap(Map.Entry::getKey,\n                            Map.Entry::getValue,\n                            (e1, e2) -&gt; e1, LinkedHashMap::new));\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":927017,"reputation":2097,"user_id":957595,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"Paul Jackson"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1405033094,"creation_date":1405033094,"answer_id":24687666,"question_id":2864840,"body_markdown":"I know this post specifically asks for sorting a TreeMap by values, but for those of us that don&#39;t really care about implementation but do want a solution that keeps the collection sorted as elements are added, I would appreciate feedback on this TreeSet-based solution.

There&#39;s too much missing. There&#39;s also an indication of not enough familiarity with how JavaFX&#39;s `TableView` works nor how to separate concerns in a non-trivial application. This answer does not directly address your code, but hopefully the example provided here can help you solve your problem(s).\r\n\r\n\r\nThat said, I believe part of the problem is that you&#39;re not separating the data from how the data is retrieved enough. I don&#39;t quite understand what your `TableView` is supposed to be displaying, but the fact your model is named `CSV_Objects` would seem to support my belief. You should set up your UI code to display a model regardless of where the instances come from, then later worry about reading the data from a CSV file. \r\n\r\nFor example, let&#39;s say you want a table to display a number of students, where each student has an ID, a name, and a &quot;year&quot; (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). You first create a `Student` class which encapsulates those properties.\r\n\r\n`Student.java`:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\npackage sample;\r\n\r\nimport javafx.beans.property.ObjectProperty;\r\nimport javafx.beans.property.SimpleObjectProperty;\r\nimport javafx.beans.property.SimpleStringProperty;\r\nimport javafx.beans.property.StringProperty;\r\n\r\npublic class Student {\r\n    \r\n    private final StringProperty id = new SimpleStringProperty(this, &quot;id&quot;);\r\n    public final void setId(String id) { this.id.set(id); }\r\n    public final String getId() { return id.get(); }\r\n    public final StringProperty idProperty() { return id; }\r\n\r\n    private final StringProperty name = new SimpleStringProperty(this, &quot;name&quot;);\r\n    public final void setName(String name) { this.name.set(name); }\r\n    public final String getName() { return name.get(); }\r\n    public final StringProperty nameProperty() { return name; }\r\n\r\n    private final ObjectProperty&lt;Year&gt; year = new SimpleObjectProperty&lt;&gt;(this, &quot;year&quot;);\r\n    public final void setYear(Year year) { this.year.set(year); }\r\n    public final Year getYear() { return year.get(); }\r\n    public final ObjectProperty&lt;Year&gt; yearProperty() { return year; }\r\n\r\n    public Student() {}\r\n\r\n    public Student(String id, String name, Year year) {\r\n        setId(id);\r\n        setName(name);\r\n        setYear(year);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public enum Year {\r\n        FRESHMAN,\r\n        SOPHOMORE,\r\n        JUNIOR,\r\n        SENIOR\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;**Note:** JavaFX properties are used to make interacting with a `TableView` easier.&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\nThen you set up `TableView` (FXML is used since you are also using FXML).\r\n\r\n`Controller.java`:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\npackage sample;\r\n\r\nimport javafx.fxml.FXML;\r\nimport javafx.scene.control.TableColumn;\r\nimport javafx.scene.control.TableView;\r\n\r\npublic class Controller {\r\n    \r\n    @FXML private TableView&lt;Student&gt; studentTable;\r\n    @FXML private TableColumn&lt;Student, String&gt; idColumn;\r\n    @FXML private TableColumn&lt;Student, String&gt; nameColumn;\r\n    @FXML private TableColumn&lt;Student, Student.Year&gt; yearColumn;\r\n\r\n    @FXML\r\n    private void initialize() {\r\n        idColumn.setCellValueFactory(data -&gt; data.getValue().idProperty());\r\n        nameColumn.setCellValueFactory(data -&gt; data.getValue().nameProperty());\r\n        yearColumn.setCellValueFactory(data -&gt; data.getValue().yearProperty());\r\n\r\n        // mock data for example\r\n        studentTable.getItems().addAll(\r\n            new Student(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;John Smith&quot;, Student.Year.FRESHMAN),\r\n            new Student(&quot;2&quot;, &quot;Jane Smith&quot;, Student.Year.SOPHOMORE)\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;**Note:** Used lambdas instead of `PropertyValueFactory`.

But these students are created in code (specifically, the `initialize` method of the FXML controller). You want to read the students from a CSV file. For that, we need to write code to parse a CSV file into `Student` instances.\r\n\r\nFor example, `StudentCsvReader.java`:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\npackage sample;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\r\nimport java.io.IOException;\r\nimport java.nio.file.Files;\r\nimport java.nio.file.Path;\r\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\n\r\npublic class StudentCsvReader {\r\n\r\n    /* \r\n     * This is really basic CSV-reading code.

Note we use a background thread and a `Task` to avoid doing I/O work on the _JavaFX Application Thread_.\r\n\r\nModified `Controller.java`:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\npackage sample;\r\n\r\nimport java.nio.file.Path;\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\nimport javafx.concurrent.Task;\r\nimport javafx.fxml.FXML;\r\nimport javafx.scene.control.TableColumn;\r\nimport javafx.scene.control.TableView;\r\n\r\npublic class Controller {\r\n    \r\n    @FXML private TableView&lt;Student&gt; studentTable;\r\n    @FXML private TableColumn&lt;Student, String&gt; idColumn;\r\n    @FXML private TableColumn&lt;Student, String&gt; nameColumn;\r\n    @FXML private TableColumn&lt;Student, Student.Year&gt; yearColumn;\r\n\r\n    @FXML\r\n    private void initialize() {\r\n        idColumn.setCellValueFactory(data -&gt; data.getValue().idProperty());\r\n        nameColumn.setCellValueFactory(data -&gt; data.getValue().nameProperty());\r\n        yearColumn.setCellValueFactory(data -&gt; data.getValue().yearProperty());\r\n\r\n        Path csvFile = Path.of(&quot;.&quot;, &quot;students.csv&quot;);\r\n        Thread t = new Thread(new ParseStudentCsvTask(csvFile), &quot;parse-csv-thread&quot;);\r\n        t.setDaemon(true);\r\n        t.start();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private class ParseStudentCsvTask extends Task&lt;List&lt;Student&gt;&gt; {\r\n\r\n        private final Path csvFile;\r\n\r\n        ParseStudentCsvTask(Path csvFile) {\r\n            this.csvFile = csvFile;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        protected List&lt;Student&gt; call() throws Exception {\r\n            return new StudentCsvReader().read(csvFile);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        protected void succeeded() {\r\n            studentTable.getItems().setAll(getValue());\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        protected void failed() {\r\n            getException().printStackTrace();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;**Note:** Expects a CSV file named `students.csv` to exist in the working directory.&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd here&#39;s an example CSV file that will work with the above code:\r\n\r\n```lang-none\r\n1,Kate Todd,FRESHMAN\r\n2,Leroy Gibbs,SENIOR\r\n3,Tony DiNozzo,JUNIOR\r\n4,Ellie Bishop,FRESHMAN\r\n5,Nick Torres,FRESHMAN\r\n6,Ziva David,SOPHOMORE\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice the modifications to the code did nothing to `Student` or how the `TableView` is configured.

Now it will work for all cases."}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":7142980,"reputation":323263,"user_id":5459839,"display_name":"trincot"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1674988507,"creation_date":1674988507,"answer_id":75274217,"question_id":75273327,"body_markdown":"Your algorithm works for breaking cycles anywhere, except when the cycle includes the head node. \r\n\r\nTo solve this you could temporarily prefix a dummy node before the head, use the algorithm on this longer list, and then omit that dummy node again.\r\n\r\nThe below code is your code except for the lines that reference `dummy`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public static int removeCycle() {\r\n        Node dummy = new Node(0); \r\n        dummy.next = Head; // Prefix a dummy node before the head node\r\n        Node slow = dummy; // Apply the algorithm on this longer list\r\n        Node fast = dummy;\r\n        boolean Cycle = false;\r\n\r\n        while(fast !=null &amp;&amp; fast.next != null){\r\n            slow = slow.next;\r\n            fast = fast.next.next;\r\n            count++;\r\n            if(slow == fast){\r\n                Cycle =true;\r\n               break;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        if(Cycle == false){\r\n            return 0;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n\r\n        slow = dummy;  // Start at the temporary head\r\n        Node prev=null;\r\n        while(slow != fast){\r\n            prev = fast;\r\n            slow = slow.next;\r\n            fast = fast.next;\r\n        }\r\n        prev.next =null;\r\n        return 1;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that in your main program you should not try to print the data of a `null` reference.
