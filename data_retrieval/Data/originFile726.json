}\r\n\r\n`auth_groups` jsonb data has key value pairs data (as example)\r\n\r\n    { &quot;GRP1&quot;: &quot;rr&quot;, &quot;GRP2&quot;: &quot;ro&quot; }\r\n\r\n1. First, on inserts  in database via Java JDBC. What I am doing is :\r\n\r\n       JSONObject authContacts = new JSONObject();\r\n    \r\n       for (each record in data) {\r\n           authContacts.put(contactKey, contactRight);\r\n           authGroups.put(groupKey, groupRight);\r\n       }\r\n    \r\n       String insertSql = &quot;INSERT INTO SSTA_AuthAll(employee_id, auth_contacts, auth_groups) VALUES(?,?::jsonb,?::jsonb)&quot;;\r\n       //-- Connect to Db and prepare query\r\n       preparedStatement.setObject(2, authContacts.toJSONString());\r\n       preparedStatement.setObject(3, authGroups.toJSONString());\r\n\r\n       // INSERT into DB\r\n \r\n   Now, the `toJSONString()` takes time (as much as  1 second sometimes - TIME FOR toJSON STRING LOOP:17238ms) which again is inefficient. \r\n\r\n   So again is this right way to do it ? Most examples on google directly have a string which they insert. \r\n\r\n   If I directly insert a MAP into jsonb column, it expects an HSTORE extension which is what I shouldn&#39;t be  using if I am going for jsonb? \r\n\r\n2. Now on the next part:\r\n\r\n   I need to join contact_id from discussion table with contact_id of auth_contacts json datatype [which is key as shown in example above] and join group_id of auth_groups with group_id of  discussion table\r\n\r\n   As of  now tried join only on contact_id:\r\n\r\n       SELECT *\r\n       FROM discussion d \r\n       JOIN \r\n           (SELECT user_id, jsonb_object_keys(a.contacts) AS contacts  \r\n            FROM auth_contacts a \r\n            WHERE user_id = &#39;XXX&#39;) AS c ON (d.contact_id = c.contacts::text)\r\n       ORDER BY d.updated_date DESC\r\n\r\n   This join for a user who has around 60 thousand authorized contacts takes around 60 ms and consecutive runs lesser - Obfuscated explain plan is as follows:\r\n\r\n       &quot;Sort  (cost=4194.02..4198.39 rows=1745 width=301) (actual time=50.791..51.042 rows=5590 loops=1)&quot;\r\n       &quot;  Sort Key: d.updated_date&quot;\r\n       &quot;  Sort Method: quicksort  Memory: 3061kB&quot;\r\n       &quot;  Buffers: shared hit=11601&quot;\r\n       &quot;  -&gt;  Nested Loop  (cost=0.84..4100.06 rows=1745 width=301) (actual time=0.481..44.437 rows=5590 loops=1)&quot;\r\n       &quot;        Buffers: shared hit=11598&quot;\r\n       &quot;        -&gt;  Index Scan using auth_contacts_pkey on auth_contacts a  (cost=0.42..8.93 rows=100 width=888) (actual time=0.437..1.074 rows=1987 loops=1)&quot;\r\n       &quot;              Index Cond: ((user_id)::text = &#39;105037&#39;::text)&quot;\r\n       &quot;              Buffers: shared hit=25&quot;\r\n       &quot;        -&gt;  Index Scan using discussion_contact_id on discussion d  (cost=0.42..40.73 rows=17 width=310) (actual time=0.016..0.020 rows=3 loops=1987)&quot;\r\n       &quot;              Index Cond: ((contact_id)::text = (jsonb_object_keys(a.contacts)))&quot;\r\n       &quot;              Buffers: shared hit=11573&quot;\r\n       &quot;Planning time: 17.866 ms&quot;\r\n       &quot;Execution time: 52.192 ms&quot;\r\n\r\nMy final aim is an additional join in the same query with group_id too.

A good default choice for a work queue is a SynchronousQueue that hands off tasks to threads without otherwise holding them. Here, an attempt to queue a task will fail if no threads are immediately available to run it, so a new thread will be constructed. This policy avoids lockups when handling sets of requests that might have internal dependencies. Direct handoffs generally require unbounded maximumPoolSizes to avoid rejection of new submitted tasks. This in turn admits the possibility of unbounded thread growth when commands continue to arrive on average faster than they can be processed.\r\n            Unbounded queues. Using an unbounded queue (for example a LinkedBlockingQueue without a predefined capacity) will cause new tasks to wait in the queue when all corePoolSize threads are busy. Thus, no more than corePoolSize threads will ever be created. (And the value of the maximumPoolSize therefore doesn&#39;t have any effect.) This may be appropriate when each task is completely independent of others, so tasks cannot affect each others execution; for example, in a web page server. While this style of queuing can be useful in smoothing out transient bursts of requests, it admits the possibility of unbounded work queue growth when commands continue to arrive on average faster than they can be processed.\r\n            Bounded queues. A bounded queue (for example, an ArrayBlockingQueue) helps prevent resource exhaustion when used with finite maximumPoolSizes, but can be more difficult to tune and control. Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes may be traded off for each other: Using large queues and small pools minimizes CPU usage, OS resources, and context-switching overhead, but can lead to artificially low throughput. If tasks frequently block (for example if they are I/O bound), a system may be able to schedule time for more threads than you otherwise allow.

fighting the dependency management that the Spring Boot starters do, also stop mixing jars from different versions of libraries (regardless of the library). \r\n\r\n- Spring Boot Starter Data JPA includes Hibernate and Spring ORM (remove those, as well as jdbc and tx)\r\n- Use `spring-boot-starter-security` instead of manual declaring all security dependencies\r\n- You already include the Spring Cloud parent, don&#39;t specify dependencies with versions\r\n- Use `spring-boot-starter-websockets` instead of manual dependencies\r\n- Use `spring-boot-starter-mail` instead of manual dependencies `javax.mail` etc\r\n- Use the `spring-boot-starter-integration` dependency and remove the version from the ftp dependency\r\n- Use `spring-boot-starter-aop` instead of directly aspectj (with old dependencies)\r\n- Your spring cloud dependency is the wrong one you need 2021.0.3 to be compatible with Spring Boot 2.7\r\n\r\nWhich is, more or less, what was done in your working pom, but
