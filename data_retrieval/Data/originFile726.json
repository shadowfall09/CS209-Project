Then unzip it and open it using a convenient IDEA. (Ex: IntelliJ)\r\n\r\n&gt; Here, you have to add dependencies as I have done. `PostgreSQL Driver\r\n&gt; SQL` allows Java programs to connect to a PostgreSQL database using\r\n&gt; standard, database-independent Java code. You can download and install\r\n&gt; the latest [PostgreSQL][3].\r\n\r\n **Installing Steps.**\r\n\r\n[![Installing step 1][4]][4]\r\n\r\n[![installing step 2][5]][5]\r\n\r\nWhen installing you have to give a password. And keep it in your mind, because that password is needed to connect the server. Furthermore, you have to give the port number for PostgreSQL. Now, the app is installed on your local machine. Then find the app [**pgAdmin 4**] as below mentioned in the image.\r\n\r\n[![pgmyadmin][6]][6]\r\n\r\nNow you can see an interface to enter the password to connect the server as below.\r\n\r\n[![connect server][7]][7]\r\n\r\nNow you can see a red color cross mark. So, we have to connect the database.\r\n[![disconnected][8]][8]\r\n\r\nSo, follow the below steps.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][9]][9]\r\n\r\nNow, you can see the notifications which show the successful connection of the server.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][10]][10]\r\n\r\nFor the moment if you don&#39;t have created a database, you can follow the below step.\r\n\r\n[![create db][11]][11]\r\n\r\nNow, you can see the database and the user of the database below.\r\n\r\n[![find DB][12]][12]\r\n\r\nThen we can connect our database with the created spring boot application.\r\n\r\n**Database configuration:**\r\n\r\napplication.properties file:\r\n\r\n    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/EmployeeDB\r\n    spring.datasource.username=postgres\r\n    spring.datasource.password=1234\r\n    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update\r\n    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect\r\n    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true\r\n    spring.jpa.show-sql=true\r\n    spring.jpa.open-in-view=false\r\n\r\nHere, the port number for PostgreSQL I have given is 5432. You may be different. Therefore put your port number there and the database name also should be the same as the database you have created while doing the above steps. Furthermore, the username and password should be yours.\r\n\r\nNow, we have done. Run the application and see. \r\n\r\n   `Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http) with context path &#39;&#39;`, you can see this in the terminal.

issue which says <strong>The package org.w3c.dom is accessible from more than one module: , java.xml</strong> . While searching on stackoverflow, i got one solution to find the transitive dependency and remove it from pom by exclusion tag, but open type is not showing any such package.</p>\n<p>Please refer this image <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XGGAG.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">enter image description here</a> that depicts that Node class and only one package which is within jdk 17 and no other dependency is having the same package, but still this issue is there <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NmRc7.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">enter image description here</a>.I have checked my project and org.w3c.dom package is not present in 3rd party libs or added by any transitive dependencies in the project jars.</p>\n<p>EDIT - 1 output of mvn dependency :tree</p>\n<pre><code>com.apc:designportal:war:22.1.2\n[INFO] +- org.springframework:spring-aop:jar:5.3.19:compile\n[INFO] +- org.springframework:spring-expression:jar:5.3.19:compile\n[INFO] +-
