The cost of doing a \"copy\" step is low because most objects are reclaimed and the small size reserved for the copy collector gives a good upper-bound on the maximum time spent copying.</p>\n\n<p>For objects that survive a long time in the first layer of the stop-and-copy collector, the HotSpot has a second level of stop-and-copied memory where it relocates those objects. This frees up more space in the top-level copy collector. Objects that survive long enough there are then moved to an area that uses mark-and-sweep collection. The idea is that anything that ends up there is likely to be around a long time because it's survived so long.</p>\n\n<p>This hybrid approach - plus a bunch of other optimizations - explains why allocations and deallocations are so fast. Notice that the key tricks used here - namely, relocating objects - are hard to implement in low-level languages because of exposed pointers.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":7778124,"reputation":411,"user_id":5885523,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"Judismar Arpini Junior"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":152,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"closed_date":1455249340,"accepted_answer_id":35354439,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1639312251,"creation_date":1455243947,"question_id":35353778,"body_markdown":"I understand that Java allocates objects in the Heap and why.

Thus looking at the addresses of objects in Java is pretty much never useful for anything. For a better approach at measuring the size of an object in Java, take a look at the [Java Object Layout utility](https://github.com/shipilev/java-object-layout), or use the [`Instrumentation.getObjectSize(...)` method](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/Instrumentation.html#getObjectSize(java.lang.Object)) from a Java agent.\r\n\r\nTo answer you questions as stated:\r\n\r\n1.

Please note that this API will not be compatible between versions of Neo4j, and using it is one of those &quot;warranty void if seal broken&quot; kind of situations...\r\n\r\n3. Look at the source code for `NodeImpl` instead. As to when and how data is brought into cache, Neo4j tries to be lazy about that, only loading the data you use.

Indeed I cannot use flight recording due to the jvm version.\nWith jcmd or jstat, I cannot see the process I'm interested in. As I'm new in Java, could someone suggest an application or script which would allow me to catpure those value and push them to a text file for example. I could code something in .Net as well if a library would exist.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","class","heap-memory"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":395357,"reputation":44547,"user_id":758280,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Jeffrey"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1372955681,"creation_date":1372955681,"answer_id":17474940,"question_id":17474246,"body_markdown":"The information associated with a loaded class (methods, fields, etc.) reside in the [method area](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.5.4).\r\n\r\n&gt; Although the method area is logically part of the heap, simple\r\n&gt; implementations may choose not to either garbage collect or compact\r\n&gt; it.

Add a `getId()` method to `SuperEntity.java`.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage com.elephasvacation.tms.web.entity;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.Serializable;\r\n\r\npublic interface SuperEntity extends Serializable {\r\n\r\n    &lt;T extends Serializable&gt; T getId();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n - Mostly, generated ID will be a `java.lang.Integer`, So it is `Serializable`.\r\n\r\n2. Create a getter for the `id` attribute in `Employee.java`. Please note that I have used `Project Lombok`. So, the `@Data` annotation generates the getter for the `id` attribute.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, getter method looks like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Employee.java class\r\npublic Integer getId() {\r\n  return id;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Change the `save()` method in `CrudDAOImpl.java` as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Override\r\n    public Integer save(T entity) throws Exception {\r\n        this.entityManager.persist(entity);\r\n        this.entityManager.flush();\r\n        return entity.getId(); // Let&#39;s return the generated ID here.\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n 4.
