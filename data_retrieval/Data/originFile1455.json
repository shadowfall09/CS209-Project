In my case, I&#39;m not modify a running jar.  The one answer given suggests using ZipOutputStreams, which bypasses the entire point of treating a jar as a FileSystem.  That&#39;s exactly what I did to get around this problem.  Has anyone successful used the jar as a file system and got it to update the jar when the FileSystem is closed."}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":5998820,"reputation":12666,"user_id":4712734,"display_name":"DuncG"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1649242359,"creation_date":1648889843,"answer_id":71716150,"question_id":71622164,"body_markdown":"The correct way to open a zip from a `Path` - and create if not exists - is:\r\n\r\n    Path zip = Path.of(&quot;/Somepath/to/xyz.zip&quot;);\r\n    Map&lt;String, String&gt; env = Map.of(\r\n        &quot;create&quot;, &quot;true&quot;\r\n        // other args here ...\r\n    );\r\n    try (FileSystem fs = FileSystems.newFileSystem(zip, env)) {\r\n         // code to read/update here\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou have not closed any files or streams properly so your changes are probably not flushed back to the file system and will keep hold of file handles which block some operations. \r\n\r\nUse try with resources for every operation which will manage the modifications to zip filesystem as well as closing each `Stream&lt;Path&gt;` from `Files.find`, and check other places such as `createEmptyZipFile` for the same problem: \r\n\r\n    try (FileSystem fs = ... ) {\r\n\r\n        try (Stream&lt;Path&gt; paths = Files.find(...) ) {\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        Files.copy( ... );\r\n  \r\n        try (Stream&lt;Path&gt; paths = Files.find(...) ) {\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process** \r\n\r\nYou have unnecessary code `ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile(zipFilePath)` which tests the zip is valid and you do not call `close()`, so it will prevent the zip changes being written back.

Assuming they are, to remove duplicates in your code you can compare <code>merged</code> and (n1 or n2) before updating <code>merged.next</code>. Also in the end rather than directly updating <code>merged.next = n1</code> you will have to traverse through n1 and compare merged with n1. You can also used <code>equals</code> instead of <code>merged.compareTo(n1)</code>.\nThe below code can be used in the else block of <code>merged==null</code>. <code>else if (cmp == 0)</code> is not required when <code>merged == null</code> as it does not matter if n1 or n2 is set when they are equal.</p>\n<pre><code>if (cmp &lt; 0) {\n    if (merged.compareTo(n1) != 0) {\n        merged.next = n1;\n        merged = merged.next;\n    }\n    n1 = n1.next;\n} else if (cmp == 0) {\n    // ****handles the duplicate****\n    if (merged.compareTo(n1) != 0) {\n       merged.next = n1;\n       merged = merged.next;\n    }\n    n1 = n1.next;\n    n2 = n2.next;\n} else {\n    if (merged.compareTo(n2) != 0) {\n        merged.next = n2;\n        merged = merged.next;\n    }\n    n2 = n2.next;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The last part can be replaced with</p>\n<pre><code>while (n2 != null) {\n    if (merged.compareTo(n2) != 0) {\n        merged.next = n2;\n        merged = merged.next;\n    }\n    n2 = n2.next;\n}\nwhile (n1 != null) {\n    if (merged.compareTo(n1) != 0) {\n        merged.next = n1;\n        merged = merged.next;\n    }\n    n1 = n1.next;\n}\nmerged.next = null;\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":24817189,"reputation":21,"user_id":18697905,"display_name":"Dae"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":646,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":71733635,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1649238965,"creation_date":1649049000,"question_id":71732285,"body_markdown":"I have made a method that merge sorts two linked lists in descending order.
