Here are several cites of relevance:\r\n\r\n&gt; From JSP 1.2 Specification, it is highly recommended that the JSP Standard Tag Library  (JSTL) be used in your web application to help **reduce the need for JSP scriptlets** in your pages. Pages that use JSTL are, in general, easier to read and maintain. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; ...\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Where possible, **avoid JSP scriptlets** whenever tag libraries provide equivalent functionality. This makes pages easier to read and maintain, helps to separate business logic from presentation logic, and will make your pages easier to evolve into JSP 2.0-style pages (JSP 2.0 Specification supports but de-emphasizes the use of scriptlets).\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; ...\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; In the spirit of adopting the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern to reduce coupling between the presentation tier from the business logic, **JSP scriptlets should not be used** for writing business logic. Rather, JSP scriptlets are used if necessary to transform data (also called &quot;value objects&quot;) returned from processing the client&#39;s requests into a proper client-ready format. Even then, this would be better done with a front controller servlet or a custom tag.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**How to replace *scriptlets* entirely depends on the sole purpose of the code/logic. More than often this code is to be placed in a fullworthy Java class:**\r\n\r\n- If you want to invoke the **same** Java code on *every* request, less-or-more regardless of the requested page, e.g. checking if a user is logged in, then implement a [filter][5] and write code accordingly in [`doFilter()`][6] method. E.g.:\r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- language: java --&gt;\r\n\r\n        public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws ServletException, IOException {\r\n            if (((HttpServletRequest) request).getSession().getAttribute(&quot;user&quot;) == null) {\r\n                ((HttpServletResponse) response).sendRedirect(&quot;login&quot;); // Not logged in, redirect to login page.\r\n            } else {\r\n                chain.doFilter(request, response); // Logged in, just continue request.\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n   When mapped on an appropriate `&lt;url-pattern&gt;` covering the JSP pages of interest, then you don&#39;t need to copypaste the same piece of code overall JSP pages.\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n\r\n- If you want to invoke some Java code to **process a GET request**, e.g. preloading some list from a database to display in some table, if necessary based on some query parameters, then implement a [servlet][7] and write code accordingly in [`doGet()`][8] method. E.g.:\r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- language: java --&gt;\r\n\r\n        protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\r\n            try {\r\n                List&lt;Product&gt; products = productService.list(); // Obtain all products.\r\n                request.setAttribute(&quot;products&quot;, products); // Store products in request scope.\r\n                request.getRequestDispatcher(&quot;/WEB-INF/products.jsp&quot;).forward(request, response); // Forward to JSP page to display them in a HTML table.\r\n            } catch (SQLException e) {\r\n                throw new ServletException(&quot;Retrieving products failed!&quot;, e);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    This way dealing with exceptions is easier. The DB is not accessed in the midst of JSP rendering, but far before the JSP is been displayed. You still have the possibility to change the response whenever the DB access throws an exception. In the above example, the default error 500 page will be displayed which you can anyway customize by an `&lt;error-page&gt;` in `web.xml`.\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n\r\n- If you want to invoke some Java code to **process a POST request**, such as gathering data from a submitted HTML form and doing some business stuff with it (conversion, validation, saving in DB, etcetera), then implement a [servlet][7] and write code accordingly in [`doPost()`][9] method. E.g.:\r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- language: java --&gt;\r\n\r\n        protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\r\n            String username = request.getParameter(&quot;username&quot;);\r\n            String password = request.getParameter(&quot;password&quot;);\r\n            User user = userService.find(username, password);\r\n\r\n            if (user != null) {\r\n                request.getSession().setAttribute(&quot;user&quot;, user); // Login user.\r\n                response.sendRedirect(&quot;home&quot;); // Redirect to home page.\r\n            } else {\r\n                request.setAttribute(&quot;message&quot;, &quot;Unknown username/password. Please retry.&quot;); // Store error message in request scope.\r\n                request.getRequestDispatcher(&quot;/WEB-INF/login.jsp&quot;).forward(request, response); // Forward to JSP page to redisplay login form with error.\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    This way dealing with different result page destinations is easier: redisplaying the form with validation errors in case of an error (in this particular example you can redisplay it using `${message}` in [EL][3]), or just taking to the desired target page in case of success.\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n\r\n- If you want to invoke some Java code to **control** the execution plan and/or the destination of the request and the response, then implement a [servlet][7] according to the [MVC&#39;s Front Controller Pattern][10]. E.g.:\r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- language: java --&gt;\r\n\r\n        protected void service(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\r\n            try {\r\n                Action action = ActionFactory.getAction(request);\r\n                String view = action.execute(request, response);\r\n\r\n                if (view.equals(request.getPathInfo().substring(1)) {\r\n                    request.getRequestDispatcher(&quot;/WEB-INF/&quot; + view + &quot;.jsp&quot;).forward(request, response);\r\n                } else {\r\n                    response.sendRedirect(view);\r\n                }\r\n            } catch (Exception e) {\r\n                throw new ServletException(&quot;Executing action failed.&quot;, e);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    Or just adopt an MVC framework like [JSF][11], [Spring MVC][12], [Wicket][13], etc so that you end up with just a JSP/Facelets page and a JavaBean class without the need for a custom servlet.\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n\r\n- If you want to invoke some Java code to **control the flow** inside a JSP page, then you need to grab an (existing) flow control taglib like [JSTL core][14]. E.g. displaying `List&lt;Product&gt;` in a table:\r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- language: xhtml --&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;%@ taglib uri=&quot;http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core&quot; prefix=&quot;c&quot; %&gt;\r\n        ...\r\n        &lt;table&gt;\r\n            &lt;c:forEach items=&quot;${products}&quot; var=&quot;product&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;tr&gt;\r\n                    &lt;td&gt;${product.name}&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                    &lt;td&gt;${product.description}&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                    &lt;td&gt;${product.price}&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n            &lt;/c:forEach&gt;\r\n        &lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\n    With XML-style tags which fit nicely among all that HTML, the code is better readable (and thus better maintainable) than a bunch of scriptlets with various opening and closing braces (*&quot;Where the heck does this closing brace belong to?&quot;*). An easy aid is to configure your web application to throw an exception whenever *scriptlets* are still been used by adding the following piece to `web.xml`:\r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- language: xml --&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;jsp-config&gt;\r\n            &lt;jsp-property-group&gt;\r\n                &lt;url-pattern&gt;*.jsp&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\r\n                &lt;scripting-invalid&gt;true&lt;/scripting-invalid&gt;\r\n            &lt;/jsp-property-group&gt;\r\n        &lt;/jsp-config&gt;\r\n\r\n    In [Facelets][15], the successor of JSP, which is part of the Java EE provided MVC framework [JSF][11], it is already **not** possible to use *scriptlets*. This way you&#39;re automatically forced to do things &quot;the right way&quot;.\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n\r\n- If you want to invoke some Java code to **access and display** &quot;backend&quot; data inside a JSP page, then you need to use EL (Expression Language), those `${}` things. E.g. redisplaying submitted input values:\r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- language: xhtml --&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;foo&quot; value=&quot;${param.foo}&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n    The `${param.foo}` displays the outcome of `request.getParameter(&quot;foo&quot;)`.\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n\r\n- If you want to invoke some **utility** Java code directly in the JSP page (typically `public static` methods), then you need to define them as EL functions. There&#39;s a standard [functions taglib][16] in JSTL, but [you can also easily create functions yourself][17]. Here&#39;s an example how JSTL `fn:escapeXml` is useful to prevent [XSS attacks][18].\r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- language: xhtml --&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;%@ taglib uri=&quot;http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/functions&quot; prefix=&quot;fn&quot; %&gt;\r\n        ...\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;foo&quot; value=&quot;${fn:escapeXml(param.foo)}&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n    Note that the XSS sensitivity is in no way specifically related to Java/JSP/JSTL/EL/whatever, this problem needs to be taken into account in **every** web application you develop. The problem of *scriptlets* is that it provides no way of builtin preventions, at least not using the standard Java API. JSP&#39;s successor Facelets has already implicit HTML escaping, so you don&#39;t need to worry about XSS holes in Facelets.\r\n\r\n### See also:\r\n\r\n- [What&#39;s the difference between JSP, Servlet and JSF?][19]\r\n- [How does Servlet, ServletContext, HttpSession and HttpServletRequest/Response work?][20]\r\n- [Basic MVC example with JSP, Servlet and JDBC][21]\r\n- [Design patterns in Java web applications][22]\r\n- [Hidden features of JSP/Servlet][23]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jsp/info\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jstl/info\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/tags/el/info\r\n  [4]: https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javase/code-convention.html\r\n  [5]: https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlet-filters/info\r\n  [6]: https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/9/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/filter#doFilter-jakarta.servlet.ServletRequest-jakarta.servlet.ServletResponse-jakarta.servlet.FilterChain-\r\n  [7]: https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlets/info\r\n  [8]: https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/9/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservlet#doGet-jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest-jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse-\r\n  [9]: https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/9/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservlet#doPost-jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest-jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse-\r\n  [10]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3541077/design-patterns-web-based-applications/3542297#3542297\r\n  [11]: https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jsf/info\r\n  [12]: https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-mvc/info\r\n  [13]: https://stackoverflow.com/tags/wicket/info\r\n  [14]: https://jakarta.ee/specifications/tags/1.2/tagdocs/c/tld-summary.html\r\n  [15]: https://stackoverflow.com/tags/facelets/info\r\n  [16]: https://jakarta.ee/specifications/tags/1.2/tagdocs/fn/tld-summary.html\r\n  [17]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6395621/how-to-call-a-static-method-in-jsp-el\r\n  [18]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting\r\n  [19]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2095397/what-is-the-difference-between-jsf-servlet-and-jsp/2097732#2097732\r\n  [20]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3106452/java-servlet-instantiation-and-session-variables/3106909#3106909\r\n  [21]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5003142/jsp-using-mvc-and-jdbc\r\n  [22]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3541077/design-patterns-web-based-applications/\r\n  [23]: https://balusc.omnifaces.org/2010/01/hidden-features-of-jspservlet.html","title":"How can I avoid Java code in JSP files, using JSP 2?","body":"<p>The use of <em>scriptlets</em> (those <code>&lt;% %&gt;</code> things) in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jsp/info\">JSP</a> is indeed highly discouraged since the birth of <em>taglibs</em> (like <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jstl/info\">JSTL</a>) and <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/el/info\">EL</a> (<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/el/info\">Expression Language</a>, those <code>${}</code> things) way back in 2001.</p>\n<p>The major disadvantages of <em>scriptlets</em> are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Reusability:</strong> you can't reuse scriptlets.</li>\n<li><strong>Replaceability:</strong> you can't make scriptlets abstract.</li>\n<li><strong>OO-ability:</strong> you can't make use of inheritance/composition.</li>\n<li><strong>Debuggability:</strong> if scriptlet throws an exception halfway, all you get is a blank page.</li>\n<li><strong>Testability:</strong> scriptlets are not unit-testable.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> per saldo more time is needed to maintain mingled/cluttered/duplicated code logic.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strike>Sun</strike> Oracle itself also recommends in the <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javase/code-convention.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JSP coding conventions</a> to avoid use of <em>scriptlets</em> whenever the same functionality is possible by (tag) classes. Here are several cites of relevance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From JSP 1.2 Specification, it is highly recommended that the JSP Standard Tag Library  (JSTL) be used in your web application to help <strong>reduce the need for JSP scriptlets</strong> in your pages. Pages that use JSTL are, in general, easier to read and maintain.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Where possible, <strong>avoid JSP scriptlets</strong> whenever tag libraries provide equivalent functionality. This makes pages easier to read and maintain, helps to separate business logic from presentation logic, and will make your pages easier to evolve into JSP 2.0-style pages (JSP 2.0 Specification supports but de-emphasizes the use of scriptlets).</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>In the spirit of adopting the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern to reduce coupling between the presentation tier from the business logic, <strong>JSP scriptlets should not be used</strong> for writing business logic. Rather, JSP scriptlets are used if necessary to transform data (also called &quot;value objects&quot;) returned from processing the client's requests into a proper client-ready format. Even then, this would be better done with a front controller servlet or a custom tag.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>How to replace <em>scriptlets</em> entirely depends on the sole purpose of the code/logic. More than often this code is to be placed in a fullworthy Java class:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>If you want to invoke the <strong>same</strong> Java code on <em>every</em> request, less-or-more regardless of the requested page, e.g. checking if a user is logged in, then implement a <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlet-filters/info\">filter</a> and write code accordingly in <a href=\"https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/9/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/filter#doFilter-jakarta.servlet.ServletRequest-jakarta.servlet.ServletResponse-jakarta.servlet.FilterChain-\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>doFilter()</code></a> method. E.g.:</p>\n  <pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>  public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws ServletException, IOException {\n      if (((HttpServletRequest) request).getSession().getAttribute(&quot;user&quot;) == null) {\n          ((HttpServletResponse) response).sendRedirect(&quot;login&quot;); // Not logged in, redirect to login page.\n      } else {\n          chain.doFilter(request, response); // Logged in, just continue request.\n      }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>When mapped on an appropriate <code>&lt;url-pattern&gt;</code> covering the JSP pages of interest, then you don't need to copypaste the same piece of code overall JSP pages.</p>\n<hr />\n</li>\n<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>process a GET request</strong>, e.g. preloading some list from a database to display in some table, if necessary based on some query parameters, then implement a <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlets/info\">servlet</a> and write code accordingly in <a href=\"https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/9/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservlet#doGet-jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest-jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse-\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>doGet()</code></a> method. E.g.:</p>\n  <pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>  protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\n      try {\n          List&lt;Product&gt; products = productService.list(); // Obtain all products.\n          request.setAttribute(&quot;products&quot;, products); // Store products in request scope.\n          request.getRequestDispatcher(&quot;/WEB-INF/products.jsp&quot;).forward(request, response); // Forward to JSP page to display them in a HTML table.\n      } catch (SQLException e) {\n          throw new ServletException(&quot;Retrieving products failed!&quot;, e);\n      }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This way dealing with exceptions is easier. The DB is not accessed in the midst of JSP rendering, but far before the JSP is been displayed. You still have the possibility to change the response whenever the DB access throws an exception. In the above example, the default error 500 page will be displayed which you can anyway customize by an <code>&lt;error-page&gt;</code> in <code>web.xml</code>.</p>\n<hr />\n</li>\n<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>process a POST request</strong>, such as gathering data from a submitted HTML form and doing some business stuff with it (conversion, validation, saving in DB, etcetera), then implement a <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlets/info\">servlet</a> and write code accordingly in <a href=\"https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/9/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservlet#doPost-jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest-jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse-\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>doPost()</code></a> method.

E.g.:</p>\n  <pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>  protected void service(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\n      try {\n          Action action = ActionFactory.getAction(request);\n          String view = action.execute(request, response);\n\n          if (view.equals(request.getPathInfo().substring(1)) {\n              request.getRequestDispatcher(&quot;/WEB-INF/&quot; + view + &quot;.jsp&quot;).forward(request, response);\n          } else {\n              response.sendRedirect(view);\n          }\n      } catch (Exception e) {\n          throw new ServletException(&quot;Executing action failed.&quot;, e);\n      }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or just adopt an MVC framework like <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jsf/info\">JSF</a>, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-mvc/info\">Spring MVC</a>, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/wicket/info\">Wicket</a>, etc so that you end up with just a JSP/Facelets page and a JavaBean class without the need for a custom servlet.</p>\n<hr />\n</li>\n<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>control the flow</strong> inside a JSP page, then you need to grab an (existing) flow control taglib like <a href=\"https://jakarta.ee/specifications/tags/1.2/tagdocs/c/tld-summary.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JSTL core</a>. E.g. displaying <code>List&lt;Product&gt;</code> in a table:</p>\n  <pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>  &lt;%@ taglib uri=&quot;http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core&quot; prefix=&quot;c&quot; %&gt;\n  ...\n  &lt;table&gt;\n      &lt;c:forEach items=&quot;${products}&quot; var=&quot;product&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;tr&gt;\n              &lt;td&gt;${product.name}&lt;/td&gt;\n              &lt;td&gt;${product.description}&lt;/td&gt;\n              &lt;td&gt;${product.price}&lt;/td&gt;\n          &lt;/tr&gt;\n      &lt;/c:forEach&gt;\n  &lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>With XML-style tags which fit nicely among all that HTML, the code is better readable (and thus better maintainable) than a bunch of scriptlets with various opening and closing braces (<em>&quot;Where the heck does this closing brace belong to?&quot;</em>). An easy aid is to configure your web application to throw an exception whenever <em>scriptlets</em> are still been used by adding the following piece to <code>web.xml</code>:</p>\n  <pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>  &lt;jsp-config&gt;\n      &lt;jsp-property-group&gt;\n          &lt;url-pattern&gt;*.jsp&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\n          &lt;scripting-invalid&gt;true&lt;/scripting-invalid&gt;\n      &lt;/jsp-property-group&gt;\n  &lt;/jsp-config&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/facelets/info\">Facelets</a>, the successor of JSP, which is part of the Java EE provided MVC framework <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jsf/info\">JSF</a>, it is already <strong>not</strong> possible to use <em>scriptlets</em>. This way you're automatically forced to do things &quot;the right way&quot;.</p>\n<hr />\n</li>\n<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>access and display</strong> &quot;backend&quot; data inside a JSP page, then you need to use EL (Expression Language), those <code>${}</code> things. E.g. redisplaying submitted input values:</p>\n  <pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;foo&quot; value=&quot;${param.foo}&quot; /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>${param.foo}</code> displays the outcome of <code>request.getParameter(&quot;foo&quot;)</code>.</p>\n<hr />\n</li>\n<li><p>If you want to invoke some <strong>utility</strong> Java code directly in the JSP page (typically <code>public static</code> methods), then you need to define them as EL functions.

There are many alternatives to JSPs for developing web facing applications using Java.

Struts doesn&#39;t even force you to use any HTML. A JSP doesn&#39;t either, but let&#39;s be honest, a JSP producing no HTML is kinda weird.

It would have been quite possible to make these changes in classes or tag library definitions, but it would have been inordinately complex due to the specificity of each case, taken longer to write and debug, and taken more time as a result to get to my users.

There should also be a scrolling functionality since each button has a fixed size (specified before launching the program) and it can&#39;t just change the button size to not overflow the `JPanel` with buttons. These overflows are typical here.\r\n\r\nIt should look something like this:\r\n\r\n[![what the result should be][1]][1]\r\n\r\nIn the following I am going through my code I already wrote which has some minor problems. For the sake of simple program reproduction, I put all my code into one `TextGui` class and every code block within this post just adds to that file.\r\n\r\n1. The `TestGui` `JFrame` and entry into the program, nothing peculiar about it.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class TestGui extends JFrame {\r\n    public static void main (String[] args) {\r\n        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(TestGui::new);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public TestGui() {\r\n        setDefaultCloseOperation(EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\r\n        setLocationRelativeTo(null);\r\n        add(new ListPanelTest());\r\n        pack();\r\n        setVisible(true);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The `JPanel` which is basically the container for all the expandable `JPanels`. Has the task to store the panels inside, so that the `MouseWheelListener` can move them all. The movement works fine until an entry is expanded, the view snaps back to the top, but should of course be the same as before.\r\nThere is also the problem of resizing. Resizing the window reveals a fatal flaw, the `JButtons` are not directly underneath each other but are rather separated by white spaces where `JPanels` *could* be revealed.\r\n```\r\nclass ListPanelTest extends JPanel {\r\n    String[] entryTexts = {&quot;dropdown1:content1&quot;, &quot;dropdown2:content2&quot;, &quot;dropdown3:content3&quot;};\r\n    ArrayList&lt;EntryListPanelTest&gt; entryPanels;\r\n\r\n    public ListPanelTest(){\r\n        setLayout(new BoxLayout(this, BoxLayout.Y_AXIS));\r\n        entryPanels = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n        for (String entryText: entryTexts) {\r\n            EntryListPanelTest entryListPanel = new EntryListPanelTest(entryText);\r\n            entryPanels.add(entryListPanel);\r\n            add(entryListPanel);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        addMouseWheelListener(e -&gt; {\r\n            for (EntryListPanelTest entryPanel : entryPanels) {\r\n                entryPanel.setLocation(entryPanel.getX(), entryPanel.getY() - e.getWheelRotation() * 20);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. The last class should be self-explanatory. A `JButton` reveals (and hides) a `JPanel`. The only interesting part is the `BorderLayout.NORTH` and `BorderLayout.CENTER`. They are important to convey the `LayoutManager` in which order and where to position both entries.\r\n```\r\nclass EntryListPanelTest extends JPanel {\r\n    public EntryListPanelTest(String entryText){\r\n        String[] entryTextSplit = entryText.split(&quot;:&quot;);\r\n        setLayout(new BorderLayout());\r\n        JButton button = new JButton(entryTextSplit[0]);\r\n        JLabel label = new JLabel(entryTextSplit[1]);\r\n        label.setVisible(false);\r\n\r\n        add(button, BorderLayout.NORTH);\r\n        add(label, BorderLayout.CENTER);\r\n\r\n        button.addActionListener(e -&gt; label.setVisible(!label.isVisible()));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe program is already pretty close to what I am trying to archive but the points elucidated in 2 are really important. How can I stop snapping to the top upon reveal of some content? How can I get rid of spacing between unrevealed `JButtons` if the size is not the `packed()` size? And is there maybe an even simpler way to this behavior (but still without an additional library)? \r\n\r\n[1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/frcec.png","title":"How can I create an expandable and scrollable list?","body":"<p>I'm trying to accomplish following:</p>\n<p>A <code>JPanel</code> (representing the container) including multiple <code>JPanels</code> which are including a <code>JButton</code> which - upon clicking - reveals another <code>JPanel</code> associated with the clicked <code>JButton</code>.

The standard parser that comes with GOLang doesn't interpret the information the way I want it to be interpreted, so I am writing my own parser.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":57402,"reputation":29252,"user_id":171950,"accept_rate":55,"display_name":"Muhammad Hewedy"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1560380021,"creation_date":1560380021,"answer_id":56571312,"question_id":17063690,"body_markdown":"I&#39;ve written a simple parser in Kotlin, it is not complete.

Modern javacs, if targeting modern JVMs ('modern' defined here as: &quot;Has the nestmates feature available&quot;), will use nestmates and forego all the synthetics.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1056871,"reputation":117749,"user_id":1059372,"accept_rate":97,"display_name":"Eugene"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":198,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":74987239,"answer_count":3,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1672695527,"creation_date":1672694583,"question_id":74987182,"body_markdown":"Having a class like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Sample1 {\r\n\r\n    public class Inner {\r\n        private int f;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void go() {\r\n        Inner in = new Inner();\r\n        int value = in.f;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe byte-code for the `go` method (before java-11) calls that known synthetic method:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstatic int access$000(nestmates.Sample1$Inner);\r\n    descriptor: (Lnestmates/Sample1$Inner;)I\r\n    flags: ACC_STATIC, ACC_SYNTHETIC\r\n    Code:\r\n      stack=1, locals=1, args_size=1\r\n         0: aload_0\r\n         1: getfield      #1                  // Field f:I\r\n         4: ireturn\r\n```\r\n\r\nfrom:\r\n\r\n```\r\n0: new  #2  // class nestmates/Sample1$Inner\r\n3: dup\r\n4: aload_0\r\n5: invokespecial #3 // Method nestmates/Sample1$Inner.&quot;&lt;init&gt;&quot;:(Lnestmates/Sample1;)V\r\n8: astore_1\r\n9: aload_1\r\n10: invokestatic #4 // Method nestmates/Sample1$Inner.access$000:(Lnestmates/Sample1$Inner;)I\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve known about this for quite some time, but I&#39;ve never questioned myself _why_ this is like this?
