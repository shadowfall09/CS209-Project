In addition it seems that the time is spent in <code>java.lang.Character.toLowerCase</code>.</p>\n<p>Total CPU for this application goes from around 10% to 98% with this change.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","spring-boot","gradle","spring-cloud-contract"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1976110,"reputation":10792,"user_id":1773866,"display_name":"Marcin Grzejszczak"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1673857915,"creation_date":1673857915,"answer_id":75131772,"question_id":75130833,"body_markdown":"You&#39;re skipping tests execution so when no tests are found the build is failing, what else would you expect?","title":"Spring cloud contract: tests based on contracts are not generated on producer side at all","body":"<p>You're skipping tests execution so when no tests are found the build is failing, what else would you expect?</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":13168241,"reputation":41,"user_id":9511597,"display_name":"Yusuf"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1674111132,"creation_date":1674029606,"answer_id":75156270,"question_id":75130833,"body_markdown":"I realized that the issue was related to the response body in the contract: ```response.body(response.fileAsBytes(&quot;resources/files/mpthreetest.mp3&quot;));```\r\nApparently it could not read from the resources folder, after I move the file to the same package where the contract file located, then the issue was resolved successfully:\r\n \r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/jSBx2.png\r\n\r\nAnd, changed the response body to ```response.body(response.fileAsBytes(&quot;mpthreetest.mp3&quot;));```\r\n\r\nP.S: Using ```Supplier&lt;Collection&lt;Contract&gt;&gt;``` interface also might prevent the contract to get generated, I changed it to just ```Supplier&lt;Contract&gt;```","title":"Spring cloud contract: tests based on contracts are not generated on producer side at all","body":"<p>I realized that the issue was related to the response body in the contract: <code>response.body(response.fileAsBytes(&quot;resources/files/mpthreetest.mp3&quot;));</code>\nApparently it could not read from the resources folder, after I move the file to the same package where the contract file located, then the issue was resolved successfully:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jSBx2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jSBx2.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>And, changed the response body to <code>response.body(response.fileAsBytes(&quot;mpthreetest.mp3&quot;));</code></p>\n<p>P.S: Using <code>Supplier&lt;Collection&lt;Contract&gt;&gt;</code> interface also might prevent the contract to get generated, I changed it to just <code>Supplier&lt;Contract&gt;</code></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":13168241,"reputation":41,"user_id":9511597,"display_name":"Yusuf"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":386,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":75156270,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1674111132,"creation_date":1673850395,"question_id":75130833,"body_markdown":"Tests are not being generated based on contracts in java.

For example, I wrote this to turn empty strings into nulls:</p>\n<pre><code>JsonNode node = p.readValueAsTree();        \n        String text = (Objects.isNull(node) ? null : node.asText());\n        if (StringUtils.isEmpty(text)) {\n            return null;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n<p>I don't think this will work because JsonNode doesn't have an asSet() method.</p>\n<p>I've found examples online that look promising but it seems like all the examples of working with collections involve working with the elements inside the collection, not the collection itself.</p>\n<p>So far, I've been hand-coding this process but I'm sure there's a better way to deal with it.</p>\n<p>I'm at the point of figuring it out by trial and error so any examples, ideas, or advice would be appreciated.</p>\n<p>Here's what I'm thinking it should look like:</p>\n<pre><code>@JsonComponent\npublic class SetDeserializer extends Std???Deserializer&lt;Set&lt;?&gt;&gt; {\n    \n    public SetDeserializer() {\n        super(Set.class);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Set&lt;?&gt; deserialize(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt) throws IOException, JsonProcessingException {\n        JsonNode node = p.readValueAsTree();        \n        Set&lt;?&gt; mySet = (Objects.isNull(node) ? null : node.asSet());\n        if (CollectionUtils.isEmpty(mySet)) {\n            return null;\n        }\n        return super().deserialize(p, ctxt);\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","jacoco"],"owner":{"account_id":24287116,"reputation":408,"user_id":18232723,"display_name":"kylie.zoltan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":119,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1674080277,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1674080409,"creation_date":1674080133,"question_id":75165823,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to achieve 100% coverage but SonarQube/JaCoCo says line 7 is not tested.\r\n\r\nI did this test to test the main:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        try ( MockedStatic&lt;SpringApplication&gt; springApplicationMockedStatic = Mockito.mockStatic( SpringApplication.class ) )\r\n        {\r\n            ApiApplication.main( new String[] {} );\r\n\r\n            springApplicationMockedStatic.verify( () -&gt; SpringApplication.run( ApiApplication.class, new String[] {} ) );\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow can I fix the missing coverage?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[![Coverage][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/luCD6.png","title":"JaCoCo add missing coverage","body":"<p>I'm trying to achieve 100% coverage but SonarQube/JaCoCo says line 7 is not tested.</p>\n<p>I did this test to test the main:</p>\n<pre><code>        try ( MockedStatic&lt;SpringApplication&gt; springApplicationMockedStatic = Mockito.mockStatic( SpringApplication.class ) )\n        {\n            ApiApplication.main( new String[] {} );\n\n            springApplicationMockedStatic.verify( () -&gt; SpringApplication.run( ApiApplication.class, new String[] {} ) );\n        }\n</code></pre>\n<p>How can I fix the missing coverage?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/luCD6.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/luCD6.png\" alt=\"Coverage\" /></a></p>\n"},{"tags":["java","sql","spring-boot","jpa","spring-data-jpa"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":18655,"reputation":4922,"user_id":42962,"accept_rate":71,"display_name":"hooknc"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1674064443,"creation_date":1674064443,"answer_id":75163342,"question_id":75163299,"body_markdown":"The first query uses DISTINCT, the query in your Repository does not.

I monitored network traffic while creating this task in the web UI and came up with this solution in the form of a bash snippet:</p>\n<pre><code># create the task\nresponse=$(curl \\\n  --silent \\\n  --fail \\\n  --user $NEXUS_USERNAME:$NEXUS_PASSWORD \\\n  --header &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \\\n  --data '{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;coreui_Task&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;create&quot;,&quot;data&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;NX.coreui.model.Task-1&quot;,&quot;typeId&quot;:&quot;repository.maven.rebuild-metadata&quot;,&quot;enabled&quot;:true,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;rebuild maven metadata&quot;,&quot;alertEmail&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;notificationCondition&quot;:&quot;FAILURE&quot;,&quot;schedule&quot;:&quot;manual&quot;,&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;repositoryName&quot;:&quot;maven-hosted&quot;,&quot;groupId&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;artifactId&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;baseVersion&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;rebuildChecksums&quot;:&quot;false&quot;},&quot;recurringDays&quot;:[],&quot;startDate&quot;:null,&quot;timeZoneOffset&quot;:&quot;+00:00&quot;}],&quot;type&quot;:&quot;rpc&quot;,&quot;tid&quot;:0}' \\\n  http://$NEXUS_SERVER/service/extdirect)\n\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n  taskid=$(echo $response | jq -r .result.data.id)\n  if [[ &quot;$taskid&quot; != &quot;null&quot; ]]; then\n    # run the task\n    curl \\\n      --silent \\\n      --user $NEXUS_USERNAME:$NEXUS_PASSWORD \\\n      --header 'accept: application/json' \\\n      --header &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \\\n      --request 'POST' \\\n      --data '' \\\n      http://$NEXUS_SERVER/service/rest/v1/tasks/${taskid}/run\n  fi\nfi\n</code></pre>\n<p>We're using Nexus OSS 3.41.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1687547,"reputation":3557,"user_id":1550506,"accept_rate":38,"display_name":"ѕтƒ"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":4253,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1674074326,"creation_date":1422947924,"question_id":28293361,"body_markdown":"I want to update maven-metadata.xml file in my nexus server programmatically.

Constantin,\r\nI used Your fine Solution for my little Project and after only a few Adjustments your solution worked well for me.\r\n\r\nIf you allow, my Changes were:\r\n\r\nMy Use of your Class KeywordStyledDocument in my own JFrame:\r\n\r\n    StyleContext styleContext = new StyleContext();\r\n\tStyle defaultStyle = styleContext.getStyle(StyleContext.DEFAULT_STYLE);\r\n\r\nThis line I Have changed:\r\n\tMutableAttributeSet cwStyle = Functions.style(true, false, Color.RED);\r\n\t\r\n    private JTextPane jTextPaneNumbers = new JTextPane(new KeywordStyledDocument(defaultStyle, cwStyle));\r\n\r\nI outsourced the supply of the cwStyle Instance in a static Function called style:\r\n\r\n    public static MutableAttributeSet style(boolean boldness, boolean italic, Color color) {\r\n    \t\r\n    \tMutableAttributeSet s = new SimpleAttributeSet();\r\n    \t\r\n    \tStyleConstants.setLineSpacing(s, -0.2f);\r\n    \tStyleConstants.setBold(s, boldness);\r\n

people that would like to be able to dynamically highlight keywords in a JTextPane.\r\n\r\nIn my code I extended **JTextPane** and created a component called **JSyntaxTextPane**.\r\n\r\nIt allows the developer to state a list of words that need to be coloured/highlighted, and then once those words are found within the text of this component they will be coloured accordingly. \r\n\r\n**Main Methods:**\r\n\r\n**initializeSyntaxHighlighter()** - it is the default method created by me that sets the rules for coloring of the keywords.\r\n\r\n**addKeyWord(Color color, String ...words)** - this is the method that developer can use to specify the colour and words that need to be highlighted\r\n\r\n\r\n    import java.awt.Color;\r\n    import java.util.ArrayList;\r\n    \r\n    import

src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y1fpi.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>With the use of the ideas from code of the user <strong>shuangwhywhy</strong>, I have modified his code and made some improvements that I believe will be beneficial for many people that would like to be able to dynamically highlight keywords in a JTextPane.</p>\n<p>In my code I extended <strong>JTextPane</strong> and created a component called <strong>JSyntaxTextPane</strong>.</p>\n<p>It allows the developer to state a list of words that need to be coloured/highlighted, and then once those words are found within the text of this component they will be coloured accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>Main Methods:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>initializeSyntaxHighlighter()</strong> - it is the default method created by me that sets the rules for coloring of the keywords.</p>\n<p><strong>addKeyWord(Color color, String ...words)</strong> - this is the method that developer can use to specify the colour and words that need to be highlighted</p>\n<pre><code>import java.awt.Color;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\n\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\nimport javax.swing.JTextPane;\nimport

does not highlight method calls\n * -It does not highlight objects that are not a part of common java keywords\n * -It does not have intellisense autosuggestion\n * \n * Addendum:\n * Even though this syntax highlighter is designed for java code, {@link #initializeSyntaxHighlighter()} can be modified to highlight any other programming language or keywords\n */\npublic class JSyntaxTextPane extends
