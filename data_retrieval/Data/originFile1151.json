[documentation][1] it makes a prefix query on the last search term and in your case you have only 1 search term so on that Elasticsearch will perform the phrase query.\r\n\r\nAnd prefix query works on the exact tokens, and you are using standard analyzer mostly, default for `text` fields so for `fullName` field it will have `virat` and `kohli` and your search term also generates `kohli`(notice smallcase `k`) as standard analyzer also lowercase the tokens, above you can check with the `explain` API output in your first request as shown below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&quot;_explanation&quot;: {\r\n

type <code>phrase_prefix</code> and as explained in the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-match-query-phrase-prefix.html#query-dsl-match-query-phrase-prefix\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">documentation</a> it makes a prefix query on the last search term and in your case you have only 1 search term so on that Elasticsearch will perform the phrase query.</p>\n<p>And prefix query works on the exact tokens, and you are using standard analyzer mostly, default for <code>text</code> fields so for <code>fullName</code> field it will have <code>virat</code> and <code>kohli</code> and your search term also generates <code>kohli</code>(notice smallcase <code>k</code>) as standard analyzer also lowercase the tokens, above you can check with the <code>explain</code> API output in your first request as shown below.</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;_explanation&quot;: {\n                    &quot;value&quot;: 0.2876821,\n                    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;max of:&quot;,\n

A thread safe context holder to remember the current tenant name\r\n4.

Setup a database schema creation method when a new users signs up. and maintain the tenant database name as one of the column in user table in shared schema.\r\n\r\n6.

If the string contains no variable references, the original string is returned. It does, however, not handle absent variables. If you want to handle them (in a different way than failing with a runtime exception), you have to add the policy to the function.\r\n\r\nE.g. the following code keeps variable references in their original form if the variable has not been found:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic String getString() {\r\n    return VARIABLE.matcher(props.getProperty(value))\r\n        .replaceAll(mr -&gt; {\r\n            String envVal = System.getenv(mr.group(1));\r\n            return Matcher.quoteReplacement(envVal != null? envVal: mr.group());\r\n        });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`replaceAll(Function&lt;MatchResult, String&gt;)` requires Java&#160;9 or newer. For previous versions, you’d have to implement such a replacement loop yourself.

So you'll want to stop the current container and recreate a new one.</p>\n<p>I'd advise against using the registry in this case and manage the container yourself, because it seems like you can't remove containers from the registry and will end up with a memory leak.</p>\n<p>You can autowire yourself <code>KafkaListenerContainerFactory</code>. This factory requires a an endpoint. I must admit, that it seemed a bit painful to me to setup the endpoint, if you just want to change the topic and have a callback called, because all available implementations use meta programming with bean and method references.</p>\n<p>The following snipped should get you started, although it might need some more tweaking.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@SpringBootApplication\n@EnableKafka\npublic class KafkaDemoApplication {\n    private KafkaListenerContainerFactory&lt;?&gt; factory;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SpringApplication.run(KafkaDemoApplication.class, args);\n    }\n\n\n    @Autowired\n    public void setFactory(KafkaListenerContainerFactory&lt;?&gt; factory) {\n        this.factory = factory;\n    }\n\n    @EventListener(classes = {ApplicationStartedEvent.class})\n    public void onStarted() throws InterruptedException, NoSuchMethodException {\n        var listenerContainer = factory.createListenerContainer(getEndpoint(&quot;my_topic_3&quot;));\n        registry.stop();\n        listenerContainer.start();\n        Thread.sleep(2000);\n        listenerContainer.stop();\n\n        listenerContainer = factory.createListenerContainer(getEndpoint(&quot;my_topic_4&quot;));\n        listenerContainer.start();\n        Thread.sleep(2000);\n        listenerContainer.stop();\n    }\n\n    private KafkaListenerEndpoint getEndpoint(String topic) throws NoSuchMethodException {\n        var listenerEndpoint = new MethodKafkaListenerEndpoint&lt;String, String&gt;();\n        listenerEndpoint.setMessageHandlerMethodFactory(new DefaultMessageHandlerMethodFactory());\n        listenerEndpoint.setBean(this);\n        listenerEndpoint.setMethod(getClass().getMethod(&quot;onMessage&quot;, String.class, String.class));\n        listenerEndpoint.setTopics(topic);\n\n        return listenerEndpoint;\n    }\n\n    public void onMessage(String key, String value) {\n        System.out.println(key + &quot;:&quot; + value)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As a side note, you can implement KafkaListenerConfigurer, if you want access to the registry, because it's not autowireable. But again, don't use it, if you want to kill your containers, because you can't remove the references, as far as I know.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":20510723,"reputation":3,"user_id":15052567,"display_name":"masterchi3f"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":2120,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":65842199,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1659002484,"creation_date":1611239309,"question_id":65829572,"body_markdown":"I&#39;ve got a frontend where I trigger a change of my Kafka topic to an another one.
