Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. I am currently following a sample project in a book, and am getting an error that says \"GenerationTarget encountered exception accepting command : Error executing DDL via JDBC Statement.\" I am using a MariaDB database, and my hibernate dialect is org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect.</p>\n\n<p>The query causing this issue is </p>\n\n<pre><code>alter table car drop foreign key FK2mqqwvxtowv4vddvtsmvtiqa2;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I try to run this query directly in the database it works fine. I have the ddl-auto property set to create-drop, so maybe it is trying to execute this query when the car table has been dropped and is not there? I'm not sure why it would do that or how to turn off this behavior if that is the problem. </p>\n\n<p>If I change ddl-auto to validate or update, the application fails to run at all.

Learn to read that - it is an invaluable debugging skill. Also, learn to use Log/print statements in your code to help you understand what values are being used and what order things are run in when you are confused.","title":"i have made one app to get ascii value of my character that i am going to put in my edit text but when i press my button to conver my app gets closed","body":"<p>The reason your app is crashing is because <code>sipla</code> is empty, and you try to get the first character from an empty string.

Because @finw's code doesn't have the correction for illumination, the colors that are supposed to be neutral gray come out slightly tinted.  One way of checking this is to try:</p>\n\n<pre><code> float[] g = { 50.0f, 0f, 0f };\n CIELab.getInstance().toRGB(g); \n for (float f : g) System.out.println(f);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You should get roughly the same number on all three channels, but you end up with an RGB profile that's noticeably (albeit slightly) blue.  I'm sure it is possible to correct this in @finw's code, but after a bit of playing with it and searching around, I found some excellent conversion code here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.f4.fhtw-berlin.de/~barthel/ImageJ/ColorInspector//HTMLHelp/farbraumJava.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.f4.fhtw-berlin.de/~barthel/ImageJ/ColorInspector//HTMLHelp/farbraumJava.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>For completeness, here it is.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void rgb2lab(int R, int G, int B, int[] lab) {\n    //http://www.brucelindbloom.com\n\n    float r, g, b, X, Y, Z, fx, fy, fz, xr, yr, zr;\n    float Ls, as, bs;\n    float eps = 216.f/24389.f;\n    float k = 24389.f/27.f;\n\n    float Xr = 0.964221f;  // reference white D50\n    float Yr = 1.0f;\n    float Zr = 0.825211f;\n\n    // RGB to XYZ\n    r = R/255.f; //R 0..1\n    g = G/255.f; //G 0..1\n    b = B/255.f; //B 0..1\n\n    // assuming sRGB (D65)\n    if (r &lt;= 0.04045)\n        r = r/12;\n    else\n        r = (float) Math.pow((r+0.055)/1.055,2.4);\n\n    if (g &lt;= 0.04045)\n        g = g/12;\n    else\n        g = (float) Math.pow((g+0.055)/1.055,2.4);\n\n    if (b &lt;= 0.04045)\n        b = b/12;\n    else\n        b = (float) Math.pow((b+0.055)/1.055,2.4);\n\n\n    X =  0.436052025f*r     + 0.385081593f*g + 0.143087414f *b;\n    Y =  0.222491598f*r     + 0.71688606f *g + 0.060621486f *b;\n    Z =  0.013929122f*r     + 0.097097002f*g + 0.71418547f  *b;\n\n    // XYZ to Lab\n    xr = X/Xr;\n    yr = Y/Yr;\n    zr = Z/Zr;\n\n    if ( xr &gt; eps )\n        fx =  (float) Math.pow(xr, 1/3.);\n    else\n        fx = (float) ((k * xr + 16.) / 116.);\n\n    if ( yr &gt; eps )\n        fy =  (float) Math.pow(yr, 1/3.);\n    else\n    fy = (float) ((k * yr + 16.) / 116.);\n\n    if ( zr &gt; eps )\n        fz =  (float) Math.pow(zr, 1/3.);\n    else\n        fz = (float) ((k * zr + 16.) / 116);\n\n    Ls = ( 116 * fy ) - 16;\n    as = 500*(fx-fy);\n    bs = 200*(fy-fz);\n\n    lab[0] = (int) (2.55*Ls + .5);\n    lab[1] = (int) (as + .5); \n    lab[2] = (int) (bs + .5);       \n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In my tests, it produces gray values that are appropriately chroma-free, and it is much speedier to boot.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":9487333,"reputation":1624,"user_id":7053344,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"Thanasis1101"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":8,"is_accepted":false,"score":8,"last_activity_date":1500801177,"creation_date":1500801177,"answer_id":45263428,"question_id":4593469,"body_markdown":"I used this code and it worked:\r\n\r\n    public double[] rgbToLab(int R, int G, int B) {\r\n\r\n        double r, g, b, X, Y, Z, xr, yr, zr;\r\n\r\n        // D65/2&#176;\r\n        double Xr = 95.047;  \r\n        double Yr = 100.0;\r\n        double Zr = 108.883;\r\n        \r\n\r\n        // --------- RGB to XYZ ---------//\r\n        \r\n        r = R/255.0;\r\n        g = G/255.0;\r\n        b = B/255.0;\r\n        \r\n        if (r &gt; 0.04045)\r\n            r = Math.pow((r+0.055)/1.055,2.4);\r\n        else\r\n            r = r/12.92;\r\n\r\n        if (g &gt; 0.04045)\r\n            g = Math.pow((g+0.055)/1.055,2.4);\r\n        else\r\n            g = g/12.92;\r\n\r\n        if (b &gt; 0.04045)\r\n            b = Math.pow((b+0.055)/1.055,2.4);\r\n        else\r\n            b = b/12.92 ;\r\n\r\n        r*=100;\r\n        g*=100;\r\n        b*=100;\r\n\r\n        X =  0.4124*r + 0.3576*g + 0.1805*b;\r\n        Y =  0.2126*r + 0.7152*g + 0.0722*b;\r\n        Z =  0.0193*r + 0.1192*g + 0.9505*b;\r\n        \r\n\r\n        // --------- XYZ to Lab --------- //\r\n        \r\n        xr = X/Xr;\r\n        yr = Y/Yr;\r\n        zr = Z/Zr;\r\n\r\n        if ( xr &gt; 0.008856 )\r\n            xr =  (float) Math.pow(xr, 1/3.);\r\n        else\r\n            xr = (float) ((7.787 * xr) + 16 / 116.0);\r\n\r\n        if ( yr &gt; 0.008856 )\r\n            yr =  (float) Math.pow(yr, 1/3.);\r\n        else\r\n            yr = (float) ((7.787 * yr) + 16 / 116.0);\r\n\r\n        if ( zr &gt; 0.008856 )\r\n            zr =  (float) Math.pow(zr, 1/3.);\r\n        else\r\n            zr = (float) ((7.787 * zr) + 16 / 116.0);\r\n\r\n\r\n        double[] lab = new double[3];\r\n\r\n        lab[0] = (116*yr)-16;\r\n        lab[1] = 500*(xr-yr); \r\n        lab[2] = 200*(yr-zr); \r\n\r\n        return lab;\r\n\r\n    } \r\n\r\nFor the code above I used the formulas provided [here][1] in order to convert from rgb to XYZ and then from XYZ to CIELab.

A fraction, which determines how far between two exponent values the number\n   is.
