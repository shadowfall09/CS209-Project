The confusion I have is with the onClick methods, since I&#39;m getting a text, rather than getting a new activity/fragment whenever a button is clicked, so basically what I want is to show a text after the interstitial ad, but within the same activity., but, as I understand it, you have to get a new intent after an interstitial ad. \r\n\r\nHowever, I also want to show interstitial ads on copy() and share() too. I tried to add a counter to the share() first, but that did not work for me. \r\n\r\n**Update** :- as requested in the comment here is the full code \r\n\r\n    public class HomeActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements View.OnClickListener {\r\n        TextView countTxt, quotesTxt, noAds;\r\n        ImageView previousBtn, randomBtn, shareBtn, copyBtn, nextBtn;\r\n        List&lt;String&gt;

The confusion I have is with the onClick methods, since I'm getting a text, rather than getting a new activity/fragment whenever a button is clicked, so basically what I want is to show a text after the interstitial ad, but within the same activity., but, as I understand it, you have to get a new intent after an interstitial ad.</p>\n<p>However, I also want to show interstitial ads on copy() and share() too. I tried to add a counter to the share() first, but that did not work for me.</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong> :- as requested in the comment here is the full code</p>\n<pre><code>public class HomeActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements View.OnClickListener {\n    TextView countTxt, quotesTxt, noAds;\n    ImageView previousBtn, randomBtn, shareBtn, copyBtn, nextBtn;\n    List&lt;String&gt;

Here is a code to reproduce this behaviour:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import org.jboss.weld.environment.se.Weld;\nimport org.jboss.weld.environment.se.WeldContainer; \n\nimport javax.annotation.PostConstruct;\nimport javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\nimport javax.enterprise.inject.spi.CDI;\n\npublic class TestCdi {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try (WeldContainer weldContainer = new Weld().containerId(\"test\").initialize()) {\n             FooService fooService = CDI.current().select(FooService.class).get();\n\n             fooService.test();\n             System.out.println(\"Done\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    @ApplicationScoped\n    public static class FooService {\n\n        @PostConstruct\n        public void  init() {\n            System.out.println(\"Post construct\");\n        }\n\n        public void test() {\n            System.out.println(\"test\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, if <code>fooService.test();</code> is commented, then <code>FooService.init()</code> is not invoked. But remove <code>@ApplicationScoped</code> and it is working again!</p>\n\n<p>This seems strange for me and I can't find and description of such behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the specification of <code>javax.inject.Provider.get()</code> says that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Provides a fully-constructed and injected instance of T.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, what's the issue? Is it designed so or this is a bug? And what is more important for me: how to bypass this issue? I need my service to be <code>@ApplicationScoped</code>.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":12305345,"reputation":450,"user_id":8978587,"display_name":"ShaharT"},"score":0,"creation_date":1655284478,"post_id":72628390,"comment_id":128293825,"body_markdown":"try to switch `body` from array of bodyModel to a List","body":"try to switch <code>body</code> from array of bodyModel to a List"},{"owner":{"account_id":25560367,"reputation":1,"user_id":19343080,"display_name":"Siva"},"score":0,"creation_date":1655285932,"post_id":72628390,"comment_id":128294330,"body_markdown":"@ShaharT I have try to change &quot;private bodyModel[] body;&quot; to &quot;private list&lt;bodyModel&gt; body;&quot; It&#39;s still not validate value in class bodyModel.","body":"@ShaharT I have try to change &quot;private bodyModel[] body;&quot; to &quot;private list&lt;bodyModel&gt; body;&quot; It&#39;s still not validate value in class bodyModel."},{"owner":{"account_id":12305345,"reputation":450,"user_id":8978587,"display_name":"ShaharT"},"score":0,"creation_date":1655287034,"post_id":72628390,"comment_id":128294704,"body_markdown":"List&lt;@Valid bodyModel&gt;.

Instead on each line we need to print one element from each stack that is high enough to have an element on that line. For stacks that are not high enough I print a blank string to make sure the following stacks line up correctly.\r\n - I am assuming that no pyramid is higher than 5 and that all pyramid elements are exactly 9 chars wide. The code could be refined to take other sizes into account if needed.\r\n\r\nFor better use of the Java library classes you may consider the following. It’s not what you asked, and please ignore if you don’t want to use it.\r\n\r\n - Use generics. For example `Stack&lt;String&gt; stackA = new Stack&lt;&gt;();`. This will allow you to handle the elements you get from the stack as `String` objects rather than just `Object`s.\r\n - Since generic classes don’t always work well inside arrays, you may use a `List` instead of your array, for example `List&lt;Stack&lt;String&gt;&gt; combine = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();` (optionally give a suggested capacity: `new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(6)`).\r\n - The `Stack` class is considered legacy. The docs say that you should prefer the `Deque` interface. I recommend the `ArrayDeque` class, it implements the interface.

Instead on each line we need to print one element from each stack that is high enough to have an element on that line. For stacks that are not high enough I print a blank string to make sure the following stacks line up correctly.</li>\n<li>I am assuming that no pyramid is higher than 5 and that all pyramid elements are exactly 9 chars wide. The code could be refined to take other sizes into account if needed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For better use of the Java library classes you may consider the following. It’s not what you asked, and please ignore if you don’t want to use it.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use generics. For example <code>Stack&lt;String&gt; stackA = new Stack&lt;&gt;();</code>. This will allow you to handle the elements you get from the stack as <code>String</code> objects rather than just <code>Object</code>s.</li>\n<li>Since generic classes don’t always work well inside arrays, you may use a <code>List</code> instead of your array, for example <code>List&lt;Stack&lt;String&gt;&gt; combine = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();</code> (optionally give a suggested capacity: <code>new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(6)</code>).</li>\n<li><p>The <code>Stack</code> class is considered legacy. The docs say that you should prefer the <code>Deque</code> interface. I recommend the <code>ArrayDeque</code> class, it implements the interface. Like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Deque&lt;String&gt; stackA = new ArrayDeque&lt;&gt;(5);\n\nList&lt;Deque&lt;String&gt;&gt; combine = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(6);\ncombine.add(stackA);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To use a <code>Deque</code> as a stack you use its <code>addFirst</code> method for push and its <code>removeFirst</code> for pop. It’s explained in <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the documentation</a>.</p></li>\n<li>You may use the enhanced <code>for</code> loop, for example <code>for (Deque&lt;String&gt; pyramid : combine)</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>PS If you wanted your stacks to grow from the bottom, you should probably push the widest element first and print the lines in the opposite order.

If you had a large number of tokens, it's wasteful to try parsing all of them as float, then try all of them as integer, then try a third time to count plain strings.</p>\n<p>Second, since you would be checking (and counting) each token only one time, you could:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>check for integer (before float) – if it passes <code>Integer.parseInt()</code>, increment that counter and move on to the next token</li>\n<li>if it doesn't parse as integer, make an attempt to parse that token as float – just <code>Float.parseFloat()</code> without looking for decimal; if it worked then bump counter, move to next token</li>\n<li>if it doesn't parse as integer or float, you know it's a <code>String</code> so simply bump the counter, then next token</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":5569841,"reputation":3750,"user_id":4415625,"display_name":"dani-vta"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1655278971,"creation_date":1655278423,"answer_id":72627477,"question_id":72625304,"body_markdown":"As others have already said, since `int` is a subset of `float`, you can always parse a string representing an `int` as a `float`, while the opposite is not true.
