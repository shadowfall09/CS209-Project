The requestMatchers define the base paths that the SecurityFilterChain will work with. The antMatchers define pipeline elements conforming to patterns, and can be used with requestMatchers and authorizeHttpRequests().\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s take as an example, the code I proposed the first time.

It also specifies that requests conforming to /api/contenteditor/** require the SITE_ADMIN, STANDARD_ADMIN, or DOMAIN_MEMBER roles. The addFilterBefore method specifies that a custom CustomOnPerRequestFilter filter should be added before the UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter. Notice that your custom filter would be executed in any /api/** path not only in/api/contenteditor/**.\r\n\r\nIf we instead do like the first bean\r\n\r\n    http.csrf().disable()\r\n        .authorizeHttpRequests()\r\n        .antMatchers(&quot;/art/**&quot;)\r\n        .permitAll()\r\n        .and()\r\n        .authorizeHttpRequests()\r\n        .antMatchers(&quot;/**&quot;)\r\n        .authenticated()\r\n\r\nThe requestMatcher by default is any path, so here we are operating over all the urls if we incluide a filter in here would be executed in any path that doesn&#39;t match the previous filter. The art endpoint is public but the rest are under authentication.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s important to note that the order of the beans is essential, as Spring will use the first bean that conforms to the URL. Therefore, the most specific should be the first in order, and the most general should be the last.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nLastly, it&#39;s important not to annotate custom security filters as @Component or any other IOD annotation in this approach because Spring scans every bean that implements the filter and adds it to the regular filter chain.\r\n\r\nNote that the provided code works with Spring Security 5, but in Spring Security 6, things will change.

This is called Liskov&#39;s substitution principle (the idea being that if you define some algorithm where as part of the input you need some sort of `Vehicle`, then LSP says I should be able to take your spec, replace `Vehicle` with some subtype of it, such as `Train`, and the algorithm still needs to make sense: You must always be able to substitute a parent type with a subtype.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, __`Vehicle` should not have `accelerate` at all__. If not all vehicles can do it, then it&#39;s not part of `Vehicle`. You may want to introduce a new interface that captures the notion of a vehicle whose speeds _can_ change, which e.g. `Car` and `Bicycle` implement, but `Train` does not. `accelerate` should be in that interface.\r\n\r\nThere is now no need for `TrainSpeedChangeException` - because the `Train` class isn&#39;t going to have an `accelerate` method _at all_.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;re falling afoul of these rules when you write an implementation of a method whose body consists solely of a single `throw` clause.\r\n\r\nNote that the JVM/java core libs themselves don&#39;t fully follow this: It&#39;s not a law, it&#39;s a principle. For example, immutable lists still have an `add` method whose body simply `throw new UnsupportedOperationException()`\r\n\r\n## The relationship between checked and unchecked exceptions\r\n\r\nIf it is plausible that a certain exception cannot occur unless a bug has been programmed, then __that should never be a checked exception__. The reason should be obvious - if you want to &#39;catch&#39; bugs, then obviously you have to catch the runtimeexceptions (just about every -caused-by-bug- exception the JVM itself throws as runtimeexceptions, such as NullPointerException). Having to write `catch (SomeExceptionThatCannotOccurUnlessBugs)` everywhere is pointless, and what do you put in the catch block anyway? A log statement? A runtime exception that bubbles up the top results in that anyway, or if it doesn&#39;t, you have bigger problems.\r\n\r\nThe Java core libs itself do apply this rule: `UnsupportedOperationException` is a RuntimeException (meaning, you don&#39;t need to declare it in your `throws` clauses).\r\n\r\n## exception hierarchies\r\n\r\nWhenever you grow a cavalcade of checked exceptions, it is virtually always correct to introduce a type in the type hierarchy to cover all of it. The core libs do this too - the security (cryptography)-related APIs have a ton of checked exceptions (key is in the wrong format, that algorithm does not exist, the input doesn&#39;t fit the expected format, and so on), and they _all_ `extends GeneralSecurityException` so that code that wants to react to some sort of problem with the config of the crypto but not any _particular_ problem, can simply catch GSE.\r\n\r\nIOExceptions are the same way. There&#39;s exception types to cover &#39;that file does not exist&#39;, &#39;this process does not have the required access rights to do that&#39;, &#39;the disk is full&#39;, &#39;that channel is already closed&#39;, &#39;the other side hung up&#39;, &#39;the entire network card went offline&#39;, and a hundred more such specifics, and they _all_ are declared as e.g. `public class NoSuchFileException extends IOException {}` so that you can choose: If you want to specifically detect file-not-found, catch NSFEx, if you want to have a fallback handler for any I/O problem, catch the more general IOEx.\r\n\r\n## Some closing notes\r\n\r\nExceptions that ever show up in a log are generally _always_ a dire situation. Therefore, by convention, __do not__ make exception messages all caps, and __do not__ include punctuation at the end of them. _Especially_ exclamation points.

This is called Liskov's substitution principle (the idea being that if you define some algorithm where as part of the input you need some sort of <code>Vehicle</code>, then LSP says I should be able to take your spec, replace <code>Vehicle</code> with some subtype of it, such as <code>Train</code>, and the algorithm still needs to make sense: You must always be able to substitute a parent type with a subtype.</p>\n<p>As a consequence, <strong><code>Vehicle</code> should not have <code>accelerate</code> at all</strong>. If not all vehicles can do it, then it's not part of <code>Vehicle</code>. You may want to introduce a new interface that captures the notion of a vehicle whose speeds <em>can</em> change, which e.g. <code>Car</code> and <code>Bicycle</code> implement, but <code>Train</code> does not. <code>accelerate</code> should be in that interface.</p>\n<p>There is now no need for <code>TrainSpeedChangeException</code> - because the <code>Train</code> class isn't going to have an <code>accelerate</code> method <em>at all</em>.</p>\n<p>You're falling afoul of these rules when you write an implementation of a method whose body consists solely of a single <code>throw</code> clause.</p>\n<p>Note that the JVM/java core libs themselves don't fully follow this: It's not a law, it's a principle. For example, immutable lists still have an <code>add</code> method whose body simply <code>throw new UnsupportedOperationException()</code></p>\n<h2>The relationship between checked and unchecked exceptions</h2>\n<p>If it is plausible that a certain exception cannot occur unless a bug has been programmed, then <strong>that should never be a checked exception</strong>. The reason should be obvious - if you want to 'catch' bugs, then obviously you have to catch the runtimeexceptions (just about every -caused-by-bug- exception the JVM itself throws as runtimeexceptions, such as NullPointerException). Having to write <code>catch (SomeExceptionThatCannotOccurUnlessBugs)</code> everywhere is pointless, and what do you put in the catch block anyway? A log statement? A runtime exception that bubbles up the top results in that anyway, or if it doesn't, you have bigger problems.</p>\n<p>The Java core libs itself do apply this rule: <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> is a RuntimeException (meaning, you don't need to declare it in your <code>throws</code> clauses).</p>\n<h2>exception hierarchies</h2>\n<p>Whenever you grow a cavalcade of checked exceptions, it is virtually always correct to introduce a type in the type hierarchy to cover all of it. The core libs do this too - the security (cryptography)-related APIs have a ton of checked exceptions (key is in the wrong format, that algorithm does not exist, the input doesn't fit the expected format, and so on), and they <em>all</em> <code>extends GeneralSecurityException</code> so that code that wants to react to some sort of problem with the config of the crypto but not any <em>particular</em> problem, can simply catch GSE.</p>\n<p>IOExceptions are the same way. There's exception types to cover 'that file does not exist', 'this process does not have the required access rights to do that', 'the disk is full', 'that channel is already closed', 'the other side hung up', 'the entire network card went offline', and a hundred more such specifics, and they <em>all</em> are declared as e.g. <code>public class NoSuchFileException extends IOException {}</code> so that you can choose: If you want to specifically detect file-not-found, catch NSFEx, if you want to have a fallback handler for any I/O problem, catch the more general IOEx.</p>\n<h2>Some closing notes</h2>\n<p>Exceptions that ever show up in a log are generally <em>always</em> a dire situation. Therefore, by convention, <strong>do not</strong> make exception messages all caps, and <strong>do not</strong> include punctuation at the end of them. <em>Especially</em> exclamation points. Don't do that.</p>\n<p>You can catch multiple exception types in one catch:</p>\n<pre><code>try {\n ...\n} catch (ExceedSpeedLimit | NotEnoughSpeed e) {\n  throw e;\n} ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>.. not that you still need this construct if you apply the rules above.</p>\n<p>Also, exceptions by convention end in the word <code>Exception</code>. (And anything that extends <code>Error</code>  ends in <code>Error</code>. Don't let anything extend <code>Throwable</code> directly unless they do not convey the notion of errors or extraordinary exits of methods but are instead low-level control flow constructs, which you should almost never do (using throwables for control flow is usually a bad idea), but if you must - extend <code>Throwable</code> and there are no particular rules about what such types should use for names.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3380632,"reputation":14294,"user_id":2837741,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"daniu"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1682338062,"creation_date":1682337622,"answer_id":76091628,"question_id":76091367,"body_markdown":"You may introduce a common Exception type, \r\n\r\n```\r\nclass AccelerationException extends Exception {}\r\n```\r\nand then subclass the other exceptions from that.\r\n```\r\nclass ExceedSpeedLimit extends AccelerationException {}\r\nclass NotEnoughSpeed extends AccelerationException {}\r\nclass TrainSpeedChange extends AccelerationException {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can then declare `accelerate` to throw the super type.\r\n\r\n```   \r\nclass Vehicle {\r\n  public int accelerate (int amount) throws AccelerationException { ...}\r\n```\r\nand all `accelerate()&#180;-overrides are allowed to throw a subclass exception.\r\n\r\nYou can then catch either specific exceptions\r\n```\r\npublic int accelerate(int amount) throws ExceedSpeedLimit, NotEnoughSpeed {\r\n try {\r\n   //call super class method to meet potential exceptions\r\n   super.accelerate(amount);\r\n   } catch (ExceedSpeedLimit | NotEnoughSpeed e) {\r\n     throw e;\r\n   } catch (AccelerationException e) {\r\n     // should not happen because the super class doesn&#39;t throw other exceptions\r\n     System.out.println(&quot;BUG!

This will happen with any class that try to extends two or more classes, to avoid this kind of &quot;method collision&quot; they built the idea of **interface**, basically you could think them as an **abstract class that does not extends Object indirectly**.

Consider the following change:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Abc{\n\n    public void doSomething(){\n\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString(){\n        return \"hello\";\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now your class will always return \"hello\" if you call toString().</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine the following class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Flyer{\n\n    public void makeFly(){\n\n    }\n\n}\n\npublic class Bird extends Abc, Flyer{\n\n    public void doAnotherThing(){\n\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again class <code>Flyer</code> implicit extends Object which has the method <code>toString()</code>, any class will have this method since they all extends <code>Object</code> indirectly, so, if you call <code>toString()</code> from <code>Bird</code>, which <code>toString()</code> java would have to use? From <code>Abc</code> or <code>Flyer</code>? This will happen with any class that try to extends two or more classes, to avoid this kind of \"method collision\" they built the idea of <strong>interface</strong>, basically you could think them as an <strong>abstract class that does not extends Object indirectly</strong>. Since they are <strong>abstract</strong> they will have to be implemented by a class, which is an <strong>object</strong> (you cannot instanciate an interface alone, they must be implemented by a class), so everything will continue to work fine.</p>\n\n<p>To differ classes from interfaces, the keyword <strong>implements</strong> was reserved just for interfaces.</p>\n\n<p>You could implement any interface you like in the same class since they does not extends anything by default (but you could create a interface that extends another interface, but again, the \"father\" interface would not extends Object\"), so an interface is just an interface and they will not suffer from \"<strong>methods signature colissions</strong>\", if they do the compiler will throw a warning to you and you will just have to change the method signature to fix it (signature = method name + params + return type).</p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface Flyer{\n\n    public void makeFly(); // &lt;- method without implementation\n\n}\n\npublic class Bird extends Abc implements Flyer{\n\n    public void doAnotherThing(){\n\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void makeFly(){ // &lt;- implementation of Flyer interface\n\n    }\n\n    // Flyer does not have toString() method or any method from class Object, \n    // no method signature collision will happen here\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":6453072,"reputation":37996,"user_id":4999394,"accept_rate":98,"display_name":"Ravindra babu"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":9,"is_accepted":false,"score":9,"last_activity_date":1682332900,"creation_date":1474132325,"answer_id":39549588,"question_id":2515477,"body_markdown":"You can find accurate answer for this query in oracle documentation page about [multiple inheritance][1]\r\n\r\n&gt;1.  ***Multiple inheritance of state:***  Ability to inherit fields from multiple classes\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this case,  When you create an object : It will inherit fields from all of the  superclasses.

An object is created first, and then its constructor is called to *initialise* the object.\r\n\r\nThis can be seen in the bytecode too. The bytecode for `new Platypus()` looks something like this:\r\n\r\n    NEW yourpackage/Platypus\r\n    DUP\r\n    INVOKESPECIAL yourpackage/Platypus.&lt;init&gt; ()V\r\n\r\nThe [`new`][1] instruction creates the object, and then `&lt;init&gt;`, which is the JVM name for constructors, is invoked.\r\n\r\nSo here, we can say that `chew()` is called before the object is *fully initialised*.

Take [`Font`][1] for instance. It has a constructor that takes the name of the `Font` you want, its size and its style (`new Font(String, int, int)`). To this day I cannot remember if style or size goes first. If `Font` had used an `enum` for all of its different styles (`PLAIN`, `BOLD`, `ITALIC`, `BOLD_ITALIC`), its constructor would look like `Font(String, Style, int)`, preventing any confusion.
