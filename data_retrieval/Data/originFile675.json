I created a simple Wicket project (same version as you):\r\n\r\n    mvn archetype:create \\\r\n    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.wicket \\\r\n    -DarchetypeArtifactId=wicket-archetype-quickstart \\\r\n    -DarchetypeVersion=1.4.9 \\\r\n    -DgroupId=com.mycompany \\\r\n    -DartifactId=my-wicketapp \r\n\r\nWhich has a simple log4j.properties logging to the standard output. \r\n\r\n    log4j.appender.Stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender\r\n    log4j.appender.Stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\r\n    log4j.appender.Stdout.layout.conversionPattern=%-5p - %-26.26c{1} -

log4j.logger.org.apache.wicket.version=INFO\r\n    log4j.logger.org.apache.wicket.RequestCycle=INFO\r\n\r\nThen:\r\n\r\n- I added all your dependencies (or modified the versions of existing one to match yours)\r\n - I just did some cleanup e.g. in the Hibernate dependencies, you don&#39;t need to declare them all, leverage the transitive dependencies mechanism\r\n- I added relevant `repositories` and `pluginRepositories`\r\n- I added glassfish&#39;s `javax.servlet` dependency to make the build pass\r\n- I added the `embedded-glassfish` plugin to test the whole thing\r\n- I made a few other unrelated changes\r\n - I changed the compiler settings to 1.6\r\n - I declared `slf4j-api` in the `dependencyManagement` element to control nicely the version in transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe full pom.xml looks like this (so anybody can reproduce):\r\n\r\n    &lt;project xmlns=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0&quot;

The moving head supports 16bit and this troubles me. I know that the 16bit comes from using two “channels”. 1 channel is one byte, 8 bits, so the maximum value for 1 channel is 255. When using two channels the maximum increases to 65.356 which will give much more precise movement on the pan- &amp; tilt-channel. So, a 16bit moving head uses 4 channels for controlling pan and tilt.\r\n\r\nNow I want to create a simple movement generator in Java. Simple looping the pan- and tilt-value from 1 to 255. If I understand it correct, when using 16bit moving head, it means, first setting the pan “fine” (pan only in this example) from 1 to 255 and when pan “fine” reaches 255 then increasing pan “course” with 1, like this:\r\nPan “fine” 1-&gt;255, when reaching 255 increase pan course with 1 then again Pan “fine” 1-&gt;255, when reaching 255 increase pan course with 1 and then again Pan “fine” 1-&gt;255, when reaching 255 increase pan course with 1, and so on.\r\n\r\nI need to have some kind of delay in the movement generator and I can see on various places that it is best to avoid Thread.sleep() (and while loops) as it can drift, so I have decided to built the generator in its own method and then call this method with an Executor Service (scheduleAtFixedRate), like this:\r\n\r\n    import java.util.concurrent.Executors;\r\n    import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService;\r\n    import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;\r\n    \r\n    public class Main {\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    \r\n            test test = new test();\r\n    \r\n            ScheduledExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();\r\n    \r\n            executorService.scheduleAtFixedRate(test::run, 0, 10000000, TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS);\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n“run” is the method with the generator and “test” is the class containing the method.

The moving head supports 16bit and this troubles me. I know that the 16bit comes from using two “channels”. 1 channel is one byte, 8 bits, so the maximum value for 1 channel is 255. When using two channels the maximum increases to 65.356 which will give much more precise movement on the pan- &amp; tilt-channel. So, a 16bit moving head uses 4 channels for controlling pan and tilt.</p>\n<p>Now I want to create a simple movement generator in Java. Simple looping the pan- and tilt-value from 1 to 255. If I understand it correct, when using 16bit moving head, it means, first setting the pan “fine” (pan only in this example) from 1 to 255 and when pan “fine” reaches 255 then increasing pan “course” with 1, like this:\nPan “fine” 1-&gt;255, when reaching 255 increase pan course with 1 then again Pan “fine” 1-&gt;255, when reaching 255 increase pan course with 1 and then again Pan “fine” 1-&gt;255, when reaching 255 increase pan course with 1, and so on.</p>\n<p>I need to have some kind of delay in the movement generator and I can see on various places that it is best to avoid Thread.sleep() (and while loops) as it can drift, so I have decided to built the generator in its own method and then call this method with an Executor Service (scheduleAtFixedRate), like this:</p>\n<pre><code>import java.util.concurrent.Executors;\nimport java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService;\nimport java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        test test = new test();\n\n        ScheduledExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();\n\n        executorService.scheduleAtFixedRate(test::run, 0, 10000000, TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS);\n\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>“run” is the method with the generator and “test” is the class containing the method.

However, the statement lambdas and the local variables of type `Optional` do seem to add a fair amount of clutter.\r\n\r\nFirst, I&#39;ll take the liberty of modifying the original code by wrapping it in a method, giving the parameters nice names, and making up some type names.

Given source and target users and an event -- no Optional stuff -- it sends mail about it. This is the computation that needs to be performed after all the optional stuff has been dealt with. I&#39;ve also moved the data extraction (email, name) in here instead of mixing it with the Optional processing in the outer layer. Again, this makes sense to me: send mail from *source* to *target* about *event*.\r\n\r\n    void setupInvite(User target, User source, Event event) {\r\n        sendInvite(target.getEmail(), String.format(&quot;Hi %s, %s has invited you to %s&quot;,\r\n                   target.getName(), source.getName(), event.getName()));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow, let&#39;s deal with the optional stuff. As I said above, `ifPresent` is the way to go here, since we want to do something with side effects. It also provides a way to &quot;extract&quot; the value from an Optional and bind it to a name, but only within the context of a lambda expression. Since we want to do this for three different Optionals, nesting is called for. Nesting allows names from outer lambdas to be captured by inner lambdas. This lets us bind names to values extracted from the Optionals -- but only if they&#39;re present. This can&#39;t really be done with a linear chain, since some intermediate data structure like a tuple would be necessary to build up the partial results.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the innermost lambda, we call the helper method defined above.\r\n\r\n    void inviteById(UserId targetId, UserId sourceID, EventId eventId) {\r\n        userRepository.findById(targetId).ifPresent(\r\n            target -&gt; userRepository.findById(sourceID).ifPresent(\r\n                source -&gt; eventRepository.findById(eventId).ifPresent(\r\n                    event -&gt; setupInvite(target, source, event))));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote that I&#39;ve inlined the Optionals instead of holding them in local variables. This reveals the nesting structure a bit better. It also provides for &quot;short-circuiting&quot; of the operation if one of the lookups doesn&#39;t find anything, since `ifPresent` simply does nothing on an empty Optional.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s still a bit dense to my eye, though. I think the reason is that this code still depends on some external repositories on which to do the lookups. It&#39;s a bit uncomfortable to have this mixed together with the Optional processing. A possibility is simply to extract the lookups into their own methods `findUser` and `findEvent`. These are pretty obvious so I won&#39;t write them out. But if this were done, the result would be:\r\n\r\n    void inviteById(UserId targetId, UserId sourceID, EventId eventId) {\r\n        findUser(targetId).ifPresent(\r\n            target -&gt; findUser(sourceID).ifPresent(\r\n                source -&gt; findEvent(eventId).ifPresent(\r\n                    event -&gt; setupInvite(target, source, event))));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFundamentally, this isn&#39;t that different from the original code. It&#39;s subjective, but I think I prefer this to the original code. It has the same, fairly simple structure, although nested instead of the typical linear chain of Optional processing. What&#39;s different is that the lookups are done conditionally within Optional processing, instead of being done up front, stored in local variables, and then doing only conditional extraction of Optional values. Also, I&#39;ve separated out data manipulation (extraction of email and name, sending of message) into a separate method. This avoids mixing data manipulation with Optional processing, which I think tends to confuse things if we&#39;re dealing with multiple Optional instances.","title":"How to use Java 8 Optionals, performing an action if all three are present?","body":"<p>Since the original code is being executed for its side effects (sending an email), and not extracting or generating a value, the nested <code>ifPresent</code> calls seem appropriate.

Hence, changing server.tomcat.max-http-header-size should be good enough and it is happening when using GET method but it can also happen when using POST method (In the POST case maxPostSize parameter should be changed).</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":5281693,"reputation":702,"user_id":4216826,"display_name":"mumbasa"},"score":0,"creation_date":1582821556,"post_id":47591403,"comment_id":106917374,"body_markdown":"I added MB to the size value 10000000 to get 10000000MB. because it gives the following error Failed to bind properties under &#39;server.max-http-header-size&#39; to org.springframework.util.unit.DataSize:","body":"I added MB to the size value 10000000 to get 10000000MB. because it gives the following error Failed to bind properties under &#39;server.max-http-header-size&#39; to org.springframework.util.unit.DataSize:"},{"owner":{"account_id":1812830,"reputation":1461,"user_id":1648546,"display_name":"Jay Ehsaniara"},"score":12,"creation_date":1582831003,"post_id":47591403,"comment_id":106921936,"body_markdown":"10000000MB is almost 10TB, are you planning to send 10TB in the header?","body":"10000000MB is almost 10TB, are you planning to send 10TB in the header?"},{"owner":{"account_id":5281693,"reputation":702,"user_id":4216826,"display_name":"mumbasa"},"score":1,"creation_date":1582896942,"post_id":47591403,"comment_id":106944806,"body_markdown":"I was only pointing out i had to add MB to the value for it to work for me i used 1MB","body":"I was only pointing out i had to add MB to the value for it to work for me i used 1MB"},{"owner":{"account_id":68136,"reputation":5468,"user_id":198996,"accept_rate":83,"display_name":"TomTasche"},"score":0,"creation_date":1603280767,"post_id":47591403,"comment_id":113985843,"body_markdown":"I had to use server.tomcat.max-http-header-size instead","body":"I had to use server.tomcat.max-http-header-size instead"},{"owner":{"account_id":2205705,"reputation":3873,"user_id":1948990,"accept_rate":20,"display_name":"matt forsythe"},"score":0,"creation_date":1692216762,"post_id":47591403,"comment_id":135595169,"body_markdown":"Just as an FYI, I am pretty sure SpringBoot properties like `server.max-http-header-size` and &#39;server.tomcat.max-http-header-size&#39; will only work if you are running an embedded server.","body":"Just as an FYI, I am pretty sure SpringBoot properties like <code>server.max-http-header-size</code> and &#39;server.tomcat.max-http-header-size&#39; will only work if you are running an embedded server."}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1812830,"reputation":1461,"user_id":1648546,"display_name":"Jay Ehsaniara"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":49,"is_accepted":false,"score":48,"last_activity_date":1519673461,"creation_date":1512124215,"answer_id":47591403,"question_id":39720422,"body_markdown":"here is the question, is there any limit in HTTP headers?

However, so that local maven repositories are recognizable und usable by your other local maven projects, you have to manually index them for some reason. I.e. add a config like this for quarkus index to the application.properties of the project including the local maven repo dependency:\r\n\r\n    quarkus.index-dependency.&lt;index-name&gt;.group-id = &lt;group-id-of-local-maven-repo&gt;\r\n    quarkus.index-dependency.&lt;index-name&gt;.artifact-id = &lt;artifact-id-of-local-maven-repo&gt;\r\n\r\nThe problem is, this causes issues for me becausse if you have 3 layers of project dependencies, say:\r\n\r\n 1. **Project A** (custom local maven repo library) \r\n 2. **Project B** (custom local maven repo library, includes Project A dependency)\r\n    - *application.properties* (indexing Project A library dependency)\r\n 3. **Project C** (Local maven project for an end product, includes Project B\r\n    library dependency - and through it indirectly Project A).\r\n    - *application.properties* (indexing Project B library dependency and config for datasources or other app related things)\r\n\r\nThen when you generate an **uber-jar** (fat jar) of Project C for deployment, it for some reason uses *application.properties* of Project B in the packaged jar, instead of from the project which im building (Project C). Thus, the app is missing key configs and does not work. Maven seems to use an inverse priority here, which i dont know if thats a bug or not. When i asked about this, i was simply told that: \r\n\r\n&quot;My dependencies should not have *application.properties*&quot;. \r\n\r\nI tried to find a way to prevent manual indexing via *application.properties* and found the **maven jandex plugin** - which is supposed to generate an index. The next problem is, this seems to only work in some projects but not in others in the dependency hierarchy, resulting in the same situation as before, and i don&#39;t understand why. This is the pom.xml config for the plugin i have included in all 3 projects (the entire pom.xml for all is too long, so let me know if you need more info):\r\n\r\n    &lt;properties&gt;\r\n        ...\r\n        &lt;jandex.skip&gt;false&lt;/jandex.skip&gt;\r\n        ...\r\n    &lt;/properties&gt;\r\n    ...\r\n    &lt;build&gt;\r\n        ...\r\n        &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;io.smallrye&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jandex-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;  \r\n            &lt;version&gt;3.0.5&lt;/version&gt;     \r\n            &lt;inherited&gt;true&lt;/inherited&gt; \r\n            &lt;executions&gt;\r\n               &lt;execution&gt;  \r\n                  &lt;id&gt;make-index&lt;/id&gt;\r\n                  &lt;goals&gt;\r\n                     &lt;goal&gt;jandex&lt;/goal&gt;\r\n                  &lt;/goals&gt;\r\n               &lt;/execution&gt;\r\n            &lt;/executions&gt;\r\n            &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n                &lt;skip&gt;${jandex.skip}&lt;/skip&gt;\r\n            &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n        &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n        ...\r\n   &lt;/build&gt;\r\n\r\nThe odd thing is, this works to the extend that i no longer have to index Project B library dependency in Project C *application.properties*, but Project B library dependency still has to manually index Project A library dependency - thus rendering the entire exercise futile. Project C having an *application.properties* was never the issue, and is obviously needed. Project B still requires a properties file to point to Project A now, **how do i solve this?**\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI have a parent module POM in the root folder containing all these projects, over which this maven jandex dependency is distributed to all modules, so it looks like this:\r\n\r\n- Maven parent module (contains all dependencies and versions used by all project sub modules)\r\n    1. **Project A** (custom local maven library repo), own pom.xml with inheritance from parent module\r\n    2. **Project B** (custom local maven library repo, includes Project A library), own pom.xml with inheritance from parent module\r\n        - *application.properties* - Indexes Project A dependency manually, **this is the problematic one which needs to go!**\r\n    3. **Project C** (Local maven project for REST API etc., includes Project B library), own pom.xml with inheritance from parent module\r\n    \r\n    pom.xml (parent module POM, containing maven jandex dependepency among others)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nEdit: One of the projects, &quot;entity&quot;, where all the database access objects are stored, does not run the jandex plugin during `mvn clean install`.

This is not a solution since i need to build the project, run the jandex plugin and install it into my local repositories separately. Also, notice that im using the &quot;io.smallrye&quot; version of the jandex plugin since the &quot;org.jboss&quot; version seems to not work at all.","title":"Maven jandex plugin does not generate index for local custom maven repositories (sometimes)","body":"<p>I have a multi module maven project wie quarkus modules and some custom libraries which are local maven repositories (so they can be used by the other maven projects/modules). However, so that local maven repositories are recognizable und usable by your other local maven projects, you have to manually index them for some reason. I.e. add a config like this for quarkus index to the application.properties of the project including the local maven repo dependency:</p>\n<pre><code>quarkus.index-dependency.&lt;index-name&gt;.group-id = &lt;group-id-of-local-maven-repo&gt;\nquarkus.index-dependency.&lt;index-name&gt;.artifact-id = &lt;artifact-id-of-local-maven-repo&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The problem is, this causes issues for me becausse if you have 3 layers of project dependencies, say:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Project A</strong> (custom local maven repo library)</li>\n<li><strong>Project B</strong> (custom local maven repo library, includes Project A dependency)\n<ul>\n<li><em>application.properties</em> (indexing Project A library dependency)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Project C</strong> (Local maven project for an end product, includes Project B\nlibrary dependency - and through it indirectly Project A).\n<ul>\n<li><em>application.properties</em> (indexing Project B library dependency and config for datasources or other app related things)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Then when you generate an <strong>uber-jar</strong> (fat jar) of Project C for deployment, it for some reason uses <em>application.properties</em> of Project B in the packaged jar, instead of from the project which im building (Project C). Thus, the app is missing key configs and does not work. Maven seems to use an inverse priority here, which i dont know if thats a bug or not. When i asked about this, i was simply told that:</p>\n<p>&quot;My dependencies should not have <em>application.properties</em>&quot;.</p>\n<p>I tried to find a way to prevent manual indexing via <em>application.properties</em> and found the <strong>maven jandex plugin</strong> - which is supposed to generate an index. The next problem is, this seems to only work in some projects but not in others in the dependency hierarchy, resulting in the same situation as before, and i don't understand why. This is the pom.xml config for the plugin i have included in all 3 projects (the entire pom.xml for all is too long, so let me know if you need more info):</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;properties&gt;\n    ...\n    &lt;jandex.skip&gt;false&lt;/jandex.skip&gt;\n    ...\n&lt;/properties&gt;\n...\n&lt;build&gt;\n    ...\n    &lt;plugin&gt;\n        &lt;groupId&gt;io.smallrye&lt;/groupId&gt;\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;jandex-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;  \n        &lt;version&gt;3.0.5&lt;/version&gt;     \n        &lt;inherited&gt;true&lt;/inherited&gt; \n        &lt;executions&gt;\n           &lt;execution&gt;  \n              &lt;id&gt;make-index&lt;/id&gt;\n              &lt;goals&gt;\n                 &lt;goal&gt;jandex&lt;/goal&gt;\n              &lt;/goals&gt;\n           &lt;/execution&gt;\n        &lt;/executions&gt;\n        &lt;configuration&gt;\n            &lt;skip&gt;${jandex.skip}&lt;/skip&gt;\n        &lt;/configuration&gt;\n    &lt;/plugin&gt;\n    ...\n</code></pre>\n   \n<p>The odd thing is, this works to the extend that i no longer have to index Project B library dependency in Project C <em>application.properties</em>, but Project B library dependency still has to manually index Project A library dependency - thus rendering the entire exercise futile.
