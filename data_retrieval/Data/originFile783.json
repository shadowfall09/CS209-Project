Of course, this method can be overriden so the developer can change how Spring obtains this data in order to support situations where the data is sparced in different tables, from a file, an API REST query, etc.\r\n\r\nThe authentication data is structured as a list, where each element corresponds to the data used to authenticate each user. This data is structured as a tuple of 3 elements: `String username`, `String hashedPassword` and `boolean isAccountActive`.\r\n\r\n**You need to provide a way to obtain this data for each user**. You do not need to **provide** the data explicitly, just the way (method) to obtain it. One way to do it (as you said) is creating a class that implements UserDetailsService, which, for example, forces you to implement `UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String email);`. In this method you need to provide an instance of a class that implements `UserDetails`, which corresponds to the `UserDetails` of the User with the username passed as a parameter. This methods (and similar) are used by Spring Security &quot;in the background&quot; to retrieve the UserDetails of a certain user when is trying to access your web server. \r\n\r\nIf the Userdetails match with the credentials provided in the request, Spring will allow the request to hit your controllers; else it will throw a HTTP 401. Of course there are other authentication methods, but for the sake of simplicity we understand credentials as user / password with HTTP basic authentication.\r\n\r\nSo, why do we need a class that implements `UserDetails`? Because is the contract that a class needs to fulfill if it has to be used for internal authentication in Spring Security. Also to separate from a `User` class the logic of the business with the logic of the security. Probably creating your own class that extends UserDetails is the best idea, but is not actually necessary. For example if you have your own class to contain the data of a user, you just need to understand how to transform your `User` instance to `UserDetails`, so Spring Security can use it transparently and the opposite: how the `UserDetails` instance can be transformed into one of your users.\r\n\r\nFor example this is a method to obtain the `User` instance using the `UserDetails` instance that is currently authenticated in Spring Boot.\r\n```java\r\n@Service\r\npublic class SecurityServiceClass{\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public User getLoggedUser() {\r\n        String username = ((UserDetails) SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getPrincipal()).getUsername();\r\n        Optional&lt;User&gt; user = this.userService.get().stream().filter(r -&gt; r.getEmail().equals(username)).findFirst();\r\n\r\n        UserDetails userDetails = ((UserDetails) SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getPrincipal());\r\n\r\n        // TODO: make error in case of null\r\n        return user.orElse(new User());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHere I retrieve the `User` by retrieving the username from the `UserDetails` and querying it to the DB to recover the `User`. I am accessing the DB using a repository class.\r\n\r\nHere I do the opposite, transforming a `User` to a `UserDetails` by creating a `Userdetails` instance based on the relevant data of the `User`. (Note that I use the email as username)\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Service\r\npublic class UserServiceClass extends GenericServiceClass&lt;User, UUID&gt; {\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    public UserServiceClass(UserRepository userRepository) {\r\n        super(userRepository);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String s) throws UsernameNotFoundException {\r\n        Optional&lt;User&gt; selected = ((UserRepository) this.genericRepository).getUserByEmail(s);\r\n\r\n        if (selected.isPresent())\r\n        {\r\n            // Obtain user by email (username)\r\n            User user = selected.get();\r\n\r\n            // Obtain the roles of this user to construct the instance of UserDetails for SpringBoot Security.\r\n            Set&lt;Role&gt; roles = user.getRoles();\r\n\r\n            return org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User\r\n                    .withUsername(s)\r\n                    .roles(roles.stream().toArray(\r\n                        (n) -&gt; {\r\n                            return new String[n];\r\n                        }\r\n                    ))\r\n                    .password(user.getHashedPassword())\r\n                    .build();\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            throw new UsernameNotFoundException(&quot;The user with email &quot; + s + &quot; is not registered in the database&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, regarding AuthenticationManagerBuilder: This is a method that is used to configure authentication. As far as I know, you can define how your application should obtain the UserDetails. I am not sure if you can provide a method or a lambda to retrieve the triplet for authentication `String username`, `String hashedPassword` and `boolean isAccountActive`. What I do know and did in my application is provide **the SQL query used to retrieve the triplet from my DB since I have there all that information**. Code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@EnableWebSecurity\r\n@Configuration\r\npublic class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    private DataSource dataSource;\r\n\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder authenticationBuilder) throws Exception\r\n    {\r\n        Session session = this.sessionFactory.getCurrentSession();\r\n        session.beginTransaction();\r\n\r\n        authenticationBuilder.userDetailsService(this.userDetailsService()).passwordEncoder(this.passwordEncoder()).and()\r\n                .jdbcAuthentication().dataSource(this.dataSource)\r\n                .usersByUsernameQuery(&quot;select email, hashed_password as passw, true from user where email = ?&quot;)\r\n                .authoritiesByUsernameQuery(&quot;SELECT user.email, CONCAT(elementpermission.journal_id, &#39;_&#39;, elementpermission.authority)\\n&quot; +\r\n                        &quot;FROM user, elementpermission\\n&quot; +\r\n                        &quot;WHERE elementpermission.user = user.uuid \\n&quot; +\r\n                        &quot;AND user.email = ?&quot;);\r\n                \r\n        session.getTransaction().commit();\r\n        session.close();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**\r\nSpring Security needs instances that fulfill the contract of the interface UserDetails because is the interface that Spring Security uses to obtain the relevant data for authentication. \r\n\r\nThe authentication manager builder is used to config *how*to obtain the data used for authentication. \r\n\r\nYou can check this links if you want better information:\r\n- https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-jdbc-authentication\r\n- https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authentication/passwords/jdbc.html\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51642604/jdbcauthentication-instead-of-inmemoryauthentication-doesnt-give-access-s\r\n","title":"Authentication Manager Builder in Spring Security","body":"<p>I am not an expert but I'd like to say something, maybe it can help:</p>\n<p>Spring uses &quot;in the background&quot; a way to retrieve user data for authentication when you activate Spring Security.

For example if you have your own class to contain the data of a user, you just need to understand how to transform your <code>User</code> instance to <code>UserDetails</code>, so Spring Security can use it transparently and the opposite: how the <code>UserDetails</code> instance can be transformed into one of your users.</p>\n<p>For example this is a method to obtain the <code>User</code> instance using the <code>UserDetails</code> instance that is currently authenticated in Spring Boot.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Service\npublic class SecurityServiceClass{\n\n    @Override\n    public User getLoggedUser() {\n        String username = ((UserDetails) SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getPrincipal()).getUsername();\n        Optional&lt;User&gt; user = this.userService.get().stream().filter(r -&gt; r.getEmail().equals(username)).findFirst();\n\n        UserDetails userDetails = ((UserDetails) SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getPrincipal());\n\n        // TODO: make error in case of null\n        return user.orElse(new User());\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here I retrieve the <code>User</code> by retrieving the username from the <code>UserDetails</code> and querying it to the DB to recover the <code>User</code>. I am accessing the DB using a repository class.</p>\n<p>Here I do the opposite, transforming a <code>User</code> to a <code>UserDetails</code> by creating a <code>Userdetails</code> instance based on the relevant data of the <code>User</code>. (Note that I use the email as username)</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Service\npublic class UserServiceClass extends GenericServiceClass&lt;User, UUID&gt; {\n\n    @Autowired\n    public UserServiceClass(UserRepository userRepository) {\n        super(userRepository);\n    }\n\n\n    @Override\n    public UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String s) throws UsernameNotFoundException {\n        Optional&lt;User&gt; selected = ((UserRepository) this.genericRepository).getUserByEmail(s);\n\n        if (selected.isPresent())\n        {\n            // Obtain user by email (username)\n            User user = selected.get();\n\n            // Obtain the roles of this user to construct the instance of UserDetails for SpringBoot Security.\n            Set&lt;Role&gt; roles = user.getRoles();\n\n            return org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User\n                    .withUsername(s)\n                    .roles(roles.stream().toArray(\n                        (n) -&gt; {\n                            return new String[n];\n                        }\n                    ))\n                    .password(user.getHashedPassword())\n                    .build();\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            throw new UsernameNotFoundException(&quot;The user with email &quot; + s + &quot; is not registered in the database&quot;);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, regarding AuthenticationManagerBuilder: This is a method that is used to configure authentication. As far as I know, you can define how your application should obtain the UserDetails. I am not sure if you can provide a method or a lambda to retrieve the triplet for authentication <code>String username</code>, <code>String hashedPassword</code> and <code>boolean isAccountActive</code>. What I do know and did in my application is provide <strong>the SQL query used to retrieve the triplet from my DB since I have there all that information</strong>. Code:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@EnableWebSecurity\n@Configuration\npublic class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {\n    @Autowired\n    private DataSource dataSource;\n\n\n    @Autowired\n    public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder authenticationBuilder) throws Exception\n    {\n        Session session = this.sessionFactory.getCurrentSession();\n        session.beginTransaction();\n\n        authenticationBuilder.userDetailsService(this.userDetailsService()).passwordEncoder(this.passwordEncoder()).and()\n                .jdbcAuthentication().dataSource(this.dataSource)\n                .usersByUsernameQuery(&quot;select email, hashed_password as passw, true from user where email = ?&quot;)\n                .authoritiesByUsernameQuery(&quot;SELECT user.email, CONCAT(elementpermission.journal_id, '_', elementpermission.authority)\\n&quot; +\n                        &quot;FROM user, elementpermission\\n&quot; +\n                        &quot;WHERE elementpermission.user = user.uuid \\n&quot; +\n                        &quot;AND user.email = ?&quot;);\n                \n        session.getTransaction().commit();\n        session.close();\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>\nSpring Security needs instances that fulfill the contract of the interface UserDetails because is the interface that Spring Security uses to obtain the relevant data for authentication.</p>\n<p>The authentication manager builder is used to config <em>how</em>to obtain the data used for authentication.</p>\n<p>You can check this links if you want better information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-jdbc-authentication\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-jdbc-authentication</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authentication/passwords/jdbc.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authentication/passwords/jdbc.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51642604/jdbcauthentication-instead-of-inmemoryauthentication-doesnt-give-access-s\">jdbcAuthentication() instead of inMemoryAuthentication() doesn&#39;t give access -

The intuition behind the problem is as follows - the only way that the maximum and minimum can change is if you push a new value onto the stack or pop a new value off of the stack.  Given this, suppose that at each level in the stack you keep track of the maximum and minimum values at or below that point in the stack.  Then, when you push a new element onto the stack, you can easily (in O(1) time) compute the maximum and minimum value anywhere in the stack by comparing the new element you just pushed to the current maximum and minimum.  Similarly, when you pop off an element, you will expose the element in the stack one step below the top, which already has the maximum and minimum values in the rest of the stack stored alongside it.\r\n\r\nVisually, suppose that we have a stack and add the values 2, 7, 1, 8, 3, and 9, in that order.  We start by pushing 2, and so we push 2 onto our stack.  Since 2 is now the largest and smallest value in the stack as well, we record this:\r\n\r\n     2  (max 2, min 2)\r\n\r\nNow, let&#39;s push 7.  Since 7 is greater than 2 (the current max), we end up with this:\r\n\r\n     7  (max 7, min 2)\r\n     2  (max 2, min 2)\r\n\r\nNotice that right now we can read off the max and min of the stack by looking at the top of the stack and seeing that 7 is the max and 2 is the min.  If we now push 1, we get\r\n\r\n     1  (max 7, min 1)\r\n     7  (max 7, min 2)\r\n     2  (max 2, min 2)\r\n\r\nHere, we know that 1 is the minimum, since we can compare 1 to the cached min value stored atop the stack (2).  As an exercise, make sure you understand why after adding 8, 3, and 9, we get this:\r\n\r\n     9  (max 9, min 1)\r\n     3  (max 8, min 1)\r\n     8  (max 8, min 1)\r\n     1  (max 7, min 1)\r\n     7  (max 7, min 2)\r\n     2  (max 2, min 2)\r\n\r\nNow, if we want to query the max and min, we can do so in O(1) by just reading off the stored max and min atop the stack (9 and 1, respectively).\r\n\r\nNow, suppose that we pop off the top element.  This yields 9 and modifies the stack to be \r\n\r\n     3  (max 8, min 1)\r\n     8  (max 8, min 1)\r\n     1  (max 7, min 1)\r\n     7  (max 7, min 2)\r\n     2  (max 2, min 2)\r\n\r\nAnd now notice that the max of these elements is 8, exactly the correct answer!  If we then pushed 0, we&#39;d get this:\r\n\r\n     0  (max 8, min 0)\r\n     3  (max 8, min 1)\r\n     8  (max 8, min 1)\r\n     1  (max 7, min 1)\r\n     7  (max 7, min 2)\r\n     2  (max 2, min 2)\r\n\r\nAnd, as you can see, the max and min are computed correctly.\r\n\r\nOverall, this leads to an implementation of the stack that has O(1) push, pop, find-max, and find-min, which is as asymptotically as good as it gets.  I&#39;ll leave the implementation as an exercise. :-)  However, you may want to consider implementing the stack using one of the standard stack implementation techniques, such as using a [dynamic array][1] or [linked list][2] of objects, each of which holds the stack element, min, and max.  You could do this easily by leveraging off of `ArrayList` or `LinkedList`.  Alternatively, you could use the provided Java `Stack` class, though IIRC it has some overhead due to synchronization that might be unnecessary for this application.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, once you&#39;ve built a stack with these properties, you can use it as a building block to construct [a queue with the same properties][3] and time guarantees.  You can also use it in a more complex construction to build a double-ended queue with these properties as well.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** If you&#39;re curious, I have C++ implementations of **[a min-stack][6]** and a the aforementioned **[min-queue][5]** on my personal site.

Oops!</p>\n\n<p>Take a look at the Mersenne Twister and other algorithms. There are ways to strike a balance between the period length and CPU cycles. One basic approach (used in the Mersenne Twister) is to cycle around in the state vector. That is to say, when a number is being generated, it is not based on the entire state, just on a few words from the state array subject to a few bit operations. But at each step, the algorithm also moves around in the array, scrambling the contents a little bit at a time.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1914880,"reputation":11452,"user_id":1839777,"display_name":"vonbrand"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":7,"is_accepted":false,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1359033460,"creation_date":1359033460,"answer_id":14502259,"question_id":14491966,"body_markdown":"There are many, many pseudo random number generators out there.

The OP has both `web` and `webflux` dependencies for some reason. However you just need `WebFlux` dependency only.  \r\n2. Implement a WebSocketHandler\r\n```\r\n    @Service\r\n    public class WebFluxWebSocketHandler implements WebSocketHandler {\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public Mono&lt;Void&gt; handle(WebSocketSession webSocketSession) {\r\n            Flux&lt;WebSocketMessage&gt; stringFlux = webSocketSession.receive()\r\n                    .map(WebSocketMessage::getPayloadAsText)\r\n                    .map(String::toUpperCase)\r\n                    .map(webSocketSession::textMessage);\r\n            return webSocketSession.send(stringFlux);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n```\r\n3. Add a path - handler mapping. Here the handler is an instance of the websockethandler.\r\n\r\n ```\r\n      @Bean\r\n        public HandlerMapping handlerMapping(){\r\n            Map&lt;String, WebFluxWebSocketHandler&gt; handlerMap = Map.of(\r\n                    &quot;/test&quot;, handler\r\n            );\r\n            return new SimpleUrlHandlerMapping(handlerMap, 1);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s it!

Use that annotation with extreme caution when you use Spring Boot.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Original Answer:**\r\n\r\nAfter a lot more research and following up on the solutions posted here (thanks for the help!) and no small amount of runtime tracing into the Spring code, I finally found a configuration that will handle all Exceptions (not Errors, but read on) including 404s.\r\n\r\n**Step 1 -** tell SpringBoot to stop using MVC for &quot;handler not found&quot; situations.  We want Spring to throw an exception instead of returning to the client a view redirect to &quot;/error&quot;.  To do this, you need to have an entry in one of your configuration classes:\r\n\r\n    // NEW CODE ABOVE REPLACES THIS! (2015-12-04)\r\n    @Configuration\r\n    public class MyAppConfig {\r\n        @Bean  // Magic entry \r\n        public DispatcherServlet dispatcherServlet() {\r\n            DispatcherServlet ds = new DispatcherServlet();\r\n            ds.setThrowExceptionIfNoHandlerFound(true);\r\n            return ds;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe downside of this is that it replaces the default dispatcher servlet. This hasn&#39;t been a problem for us yet, with no side effects or execution problems showing up.  If you&#39;re going to do anything else with the dispatcher servlet for other reasons, this is the place to do them.\r\n\r\n**Step 2 -** Now that spring boot will throw an exception when no handler is found, that exception can be handled with any others in a unified exception handler:\r\n\r\n    @EnableWebMvc\r\n    @ControllerAdvice\r\n    public class ServiceExceptionHandler extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler {\r\n\r\n        @ExceptionHandler(Throwable.class)\r\n        @ResponseBody\r\n        ResponseEntity&lt;Object&gt; handleControllerException(HttpServletRequest req, Throwable ex) {\r\n            ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse(ex);\r\n            if(ex instanceof ServiceException) {\r\n                errorResponse.setDetails(((ServiceException)ex).getDetails());\r\n            }\r\n            if(ex instanceof ServiceHttpException) {\r\n                return new ResponseEntity&lt;Object&gt;(errorResponse,((ServiceHttpException)ex).getStatus());\r\n            } else {\r\n                return new ResponseEntity&lt;Object&gt;(errorResponse,HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        protected ResponseEntity&lt;Object&gt; handleNoHandlerFoundException(NoHandlerFoundException ex, HttpHeaders headers, HttpStatus status, WebRequest request) {\r\n            Map&lt;String,String&gt; responseBody = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n            responseBody.put(&quot;path&quot;,request.getContextPath());\r\n            responseBody.put(&quot;message&quot;,&quot;The URL you have reached is not in service at this time (404).&quot;);\r\n            return new ResponseEntity&lt;Object&gt;(responseBody,HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);\r\n        }\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that I think the &quot;@EnableWebMvc&quot; annotation is significant here.  It seems that none of this works without it.  And that&#39;s it - your Spring boot app will now catch all exceptions, including 404s, in the above handler class and you may do with them as you please.\r\n\r\nOne last point - there doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to get this to catch thrown Errors.  I have a wacky idea of using aspects to catch errors and turn them into Exceptions that the above code can then deal with, but I have not yet had time to actually try implementing that.\r\n\r\nAny comments/corrections/enhancements will be appreciated.","title":"Spring Boot REST service exception handling","body":"<p><strong>New answer (2016-04-20)</strong></p>\n<p>Using Spring Boot 1.3.1.RELEASE</p>\n<p><strong>New Step 1 -</strong> It is easy and less intrusive to add the following properties to the application.properties:</p>\n<pre><code>spring.mvc.throw-exception-if-no-handler-found=true\nspring.resources.add-mappings=false\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Much easier than modifying the existing DispatcherServlet instance (as below)! - JO'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If working with a full RESTful Application, it is very important to disable the automatic mapping of static resources since if you are using Spring Boot's default configuration for handling static resources then the resource handler will be handling the request (it's ordered last and mapped to /** which means that it picks up any requests that haven't been handled by any other handler in the application) so the dispatcher servlet doesn't get a chance to throw an exception.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>New Answer (2015-12-04)</strong></p>\n<p>Using Spring Boot 1.2.7.RELEASE</p>\n<p><strong>New Step 1 -</strong> I found a much less intrusive way of setting the &quot;throExceptionIfNoHandlerFound&quot; flag.

If you're going to do anything else with the dispatcher servlet for other reasons, this is the place to do them.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Now that spring boot will throw an exception when no handler is found, that exception can be handled with any others in a unified exception handler:</p>\n<pre><code>@EnableWebMvc\n@ControllerAdvice\npublic class ServiceExceptionHandler extends ResponseEntityExceptionHandler {\n\n    @ExceptionHandler(Throwable.class)\n    @ResponseBody\n    ResponseEntity&lt;Object&gt; handleControllerException(HttpServletRequest req, Throwable ex) {\n        ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse(ex);\n        if(ex instanceof ServiceException) {\n            errorResponse.setDetails(((ServiceException)ex).getDetails());\n        }\n        if(ex instanceof ServiceHttpException) {\n            return new ResponseEntity&lt;Object&gt;(errorResponse,((ServiceHttpException)ex).getStatus());\n        } else {\n            return new ResponseEntity&lt;Object&gt;(errorResponse,HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected ResponseEntity&lt;Object&gt; handleNoHandlerFoundException(NoHandlerFoundException ex, HttpHeaders headers, HttpStatus status, WebRequest request) {\n        Map&lt;String,String&gt; responseBody = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n        responseBody.put(&quot;path&quot;,request.getContextPath());\n        responseBody.put(&quot;message&quot;,&quot;The URL you have reached is not in service at this time (404).&quot;);\n        return new ResponseEntity&lt;Object&gt;(responseBody,HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);\n    }\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Keep in mind that I think the &quot;@EnableWebMvc&quot; annotation is significant here.

I hope, that it will be helpful to some of you.\r\n\r\nI am currently building a REST API which makes use of Spring Boot 1.5.2.RELEASE with Spring Framework 4.3.7.RELEASE. I use the Java Config approach (as opposed to XML configuration). Also, my project uses a global exception handling mechanism using the `@RestControllerAdvice` annotation (see later below).\r\n\r\nMy project has the same requirements as yours: I want my REST API to return a `HTTP 404 Not Found` with an accompanying JSON payload in the HTTP response to the API client when it tries to send a request to an URL which does not exist. In my case, the JSON payload looks like this (which clearly differs from the Spring Boot default, btw.):\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;code&quot;: 1000,\r\n        &quot;message&quot;: &quot;No handler found for your request.&quot;,\r\n        &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;2017-11-20T02:40:57.628Z&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI finally made it work. Here are the main tasks you need to do in brief:\r\n\r\n - Make sure that the `NoHandlerFoundException` is thrown if API clients\r\n   call URLS for which no handler method exists (see Step 1 below).\r\n - Create a custom error class (in my case `ApiError`) which contains all the data that should be returned to the API client (see step 2).\r\n - Create an exception handler which reacts on the `NoHandlerFoundException`\r\n   and returns a proper error message to the API client (see step 3).\r\n - Write a test for it and make sure, it works (see step 4).\r\n\r\nOk, now on to the details:\r\n\r\n**Step 1: Configure application.properties**\r\n\r\nI had to add the following two configuration settings to the project&#39;s `application.properties` file:\r\n\r\n    spring.mvc.throw-exception-if-no-handler-found=true\r\n    spring.resources.add-mappings=false\r\n\r\nThis makes sure, the `NoHandlerFoundException` is thrown in cases where a client tries to access an URL for which no controller method exists which would be able to handle the request.\r\n\r\n**Step 2: Create a Class for API Errors**\r\n\r\nI made a class similar to the one suggested in [this article][1] on Eugen Paraschiv&#39;s blog. This class represents an API error. This information is \r\nsent to the client in the HTTP response body in case of an error.\r\n\r\n    public class ApiError {\r\n\r\n        private int code;\r\n        private String message;\r\n        private Instant timestamp;\r\n\r\n        public ApiError(int code, String message) {\r\n            this.code = code;\r\n            this.message = message;\r\n            this.timestamp = Instant.now();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public ApiError(int code, String message, Instant timestamp) {\r\n            this.code = code;\r\n            this.message = message;\r\n            this.timestamp = timestamp;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Getters and setters here...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Step 3: Create / Configure a Global Exception Handler**\r\n\r\nI use the following class to handle exceptions (for simplicity, I have removed import statements, logging code and some other, non-relevant pieces of code):\r\n\r\n    @RestControllerAdvice\r\n    public class GlobalExceptionHandler {\r\n\r\n        @ExceptionHandler(NoHandlerFoundException.class)\r\n        @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)\r\n        public ApiError noHandlerFoundException(\r\n                NoHandlerFoundException ex) {\r\n\r\n\t\t    int code = 1000;\r\n\t\t    String message = &quot;No handler found for your request.&quot;;\r\n\t\t    return new ApiError(code, message);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // More exception handlers here ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Step 4: Write a test**\r\n\r\nI want to make sure, the API always returns the correct error messages to the calling client, even in the case of failure. Thus, I wrote a test like this:\r\n\r\n    @RunWith(SpringRunner.class)\r\n    @SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SprintBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)\r\n    @AutoConfigureMockMvc\r\n    @ActiveProfiles(&quot;dev&quot;)\r\n    public class GlobalExceptionHandlerIntegrationTest {\r\n\r\n        public static final String ISO8601_DATE_REGEX =\r\n            &quot;^\\\\d{4}-\\\\d{2}-\\\\d{2}T\\\\d{2}:\\\\d{2}:\\\\d{2}\\\\.\\\\d{3}Z$&quot;;\r\n\r\n        @Autowired\r\n        private MockMvc mockMvc;\r\n\r\n        @Test\r\n        @WithMockUser(roles = &quot;DEVICE_SCAN_HOSTS&quot;)\r\n        public void invalidUrl_returnsHttp404() throws Exception {\r\n            RequestBuilder requestBuilder = getGetRequestBuilder(&quot;/does-not-exist&quot;);\r\n            mockMvc.perform(requestBuilder)\r\n                .andExpect(status().isNotFound())\r\n                .andExpect(jsonPath(&quot;$.code&quot;, is(1000)))\r\n                .andExpect(jsonPath(&quot;$.message&quot;, is(&quot;No handler found for your request.&quot;)))\r\n                .andExpect(jsonPath(&quot;$.timestamp&quot;, RegexMatcher.matchesRegex(ISO8601_DATE_REGEX)));\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private RequestBuilder getGetRequestBuilder(String url) {\r\n            return MockMvcRequestBuilders\r\n                .get(url)\r\n                .accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThe `@ActiveProfiles(&quot;dev&quot;)` annotation can be left away. I use it only as I work with different profiles. The `RegexMatcher` is a custom [Hamcrest matcher][2] I use to better handle timestamp fields. Here&#39;s the code (I found it [here][3]):\r\n\r\n    public class RegexMatcher extends TypeSafeMatcher&lt;String&gt; {\r\n\r\n        private final String regex;\r\n\r\n        public RegexMatcher(final String regex) {\r\n            this.regex = regex;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void describeTo(final Description description) {\r\n            description.appendText(&quot;matches regular expression=`&quot; + regex + &quot;`&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public boolean matchesSafely(final String string) {\r\n            return string.matches(regex);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Matcher method you can call on this matcher class\r\n        public static RegexMatcher matchesRegex(final String string) {\r\n            return new RegexMatcher(regex);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Some further notes from my side:**\r\n\r\n - In many other posts on StackOverflow, people suggested setting the `@EnableWebMvc` annotation. This was not necessary in my case.\r\n - This approach works well with MockMvc (see test above).\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.baeldung.com/global-error-handler-in-a-spring-rest-api\r\n  [2]: http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/\r\n  [3]: http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Hamcrest/article.html","title":"Spring Boot REST service exception handling","body":"<p>Although this is an older question, I would like to share my thoughts on this.

This information is \nsent to the client in the HTTP response body in case of an error.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class ApiError {\n\n    private int code;\n    private String message;\n    private Instant timestamp;\n\n    public ApiError(int code, String message) {\n        this.code = code;\n        this.message = message;\n        this.timestamp = Instant.now();\n    }\n\n    public ApiError(int code, String message, Instant timestamp) {\n        this.code = code;\n        this.message = message;\n        this.timestamp = timestamp;\n    }\n\n    // Getters and setters here...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Create / Configure a Global Exception Handler</strong></p>\n\n<p>I use the following class to handle exceptions (for simplicity, I have removed import statements, logging code and some other, non-relevant pieces of code):</p>\n\n<pre><code>@RestControllerAdvice\npublic class GlobalExceptionHandler {\n\n    @ExceptionHandler(NoHandlerFoundException.class)\n    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)\n    public ApiError noHandlerFoundException(\n            NoHandlerFoundException ex) {\n\n        int code = 1000;\n        String message = \"No handler found for your request.\";\n        return new ApiError(code, message);\n    }\n\n    // More exception handlers here ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4: Write a test</strong></p>\n\n<p>I want to make sure, the API always returns the correct error messages to the calling client, even in the case of failure. Thus, I wrote a test like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)\n@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SprintBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)\n@AutoConfigureMockMvc\n@ActiveProfiles(\"dev\")\npublic class GlobalExceptionHandlerIntegrationTest {\n\n    public static final String ISO8601_DATE_REGEX =\n        \"^\\\\d{4}-\\\\d{2}-\\\\d{2}T\\\\d{2}:\\\\d{2}:\\\\d{2}\\\\.\\\\d{3}Z$\";\n\n    @Autowired\n    private MockMvc mockMvc;\n\n    @Test\n    @WithMockUser(roles = \"DEVICE_SCAN_HOSTS\")\n    public void invalidUrl_returnsHttp404() throws Exception {\n        RequestBuilder requestBuilder = getGetRequestBuilder(\"/does-not-exist\");\n        mockMvc.perform(requestBuilder)\n            .andExpect(status().isNotFound())\n            .andExpect(jsonPath(\"$.code\", is(1000)))\n            .andExpect(jsonPath(\"$.message\", is(\"No handler found for your request.\")))\n            .andExpect(jsonPath(\"$.timestamp\", RegexMatcher.matchesRegex(ISO8601_DATE_REGEX)));\n    }\n\n    private RequestBuilder getGetRequestBuilder(String url) {\n        return MockMvcRequestBuilders\n            .get(url)\n            .accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>@ActiveProfiles(\"dev\")</code> annotation can be left away. I use it only as I work with different profiles. The <code>RegexMatcher</code> is a custom <a href=\"http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hamcrest matcher</a> I use to better handle timestamp fields. Here's the code (I found it <a href=\"http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Hamcrest/article.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class RegexMatcher extends TypeSafeMatcher&lt;String&gt; {\n\n    private final String regex;\n\n    public RegexMatcher(final String regex) {\n        this.regex = regex;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void describeTo(final Description description) {\n        description.appendText(\"matches regular expression=`\" + regex + \"`\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean matchesSafely(final String string) {\n        return string.matches(regex);\n    }\n\n    // Matcher method you can call on this matcher class\n    public static RegexMatcher matchesRegex(final String string) {\n        return new RegexMatcher(regex);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Some further notes from my side:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In many other posts on StackOverflow, people suggested setting the <code>@EnableWebMvc</code> annotation. This was not necessary in my case.</li>\n<li>This approach works well with MockMvc (see test above).</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":6174988,"reputation":11040,"user_id":4812170,"accept_rate":73,"display_name":"vaquar

Are we blindly following rules?</p>\n\n<p>Also, design always comes at a cost. <a href=\"https://blog.pdark.de/2012/12/17/designing-a-garbage-bin/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Every design that deserves the name means you have a conflict of goals</a>.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, you need to find answers to these questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>How many obvious bugs will this prevent?</li>\n<li>How many subtle bugs will this prevent?</li>\n<li>How often will this make other code more complex (= more error prone)?</li>\n<li>Does this make testing easier or harder?</li>\n<li>How good are the developers in your project? How much guidance with a sledge hammer do they need?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Say you have many junior developers in your team. They will desperately try any stupid thing just because they don't know good solutions for their problems, yet. Making the class final could prevent bugs (good) but could also make them come up with \"clever\" solutions like copying all these classes into a mutable ones everywhere in the code.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, it will be very hard to make a class <code>final</code> after it's being used everywhere but it's easy to make a <code>final</code> class non-<code>final</code> later if you find out you need to extend it.</p>\n\n<p>If you properly use interfaces, you can avoid the \"I need to make this mutable\" problem by always using the interface and then later adding a mutable implementation when the need arises.</p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: There is no \"best\" solution for this answer. It depends on which price you're willing and which you have to pay.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":10452620,"reputation":101,"user_id":7705733,"display_name":"Anitha B S"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1525901878,"creation_date":1525901878,"answer_id":50262435,"question_id":12306651,"body_markdown":"The default meaning of equals() is the same as referential equality.

There are some types like this that has reserved keywords that doesn&#39;t seem to match the type names directly.\r\n\r\nIn C# there is no difference between &#39;&#39;`int`&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;`System.Int32`&#39;&#39;, or any of the other pairs or keywords/system types, except for when defining enums. With enums you can specify the storage size to use and in this case you can only use the reserved keyword, and not the system runtime type name.\r\n\r\nWether the value in the int will be stored on the stack, in memory, or as a referenced heap object depends on the context and how you use it.\r\n\r\nThis declaration in a method:\r\n\r\n    int i;\r\n\r\ndefines a variable `i` of type `System.Int32`, living in a register or on the stack, depending on optimizations. The same declaration in a type (struct or class) defines a member field. The same declaration in a method argument list defines a parameter, with the same storage options as for a local variable. (note that this paragraph is not valid if you start pulling iterator methods into the mix, these are different beasts altogether)\r\n\r\nTo get a heap object, you can use boxing:\r\n\r\n    object o = i;\r\n\r\nthis will create a boxed copy of the contents of `i` on the heap.

And this code is executed, as in the logs I can see the following:\r\n\r\n    2022-05-04 12:40:00.183 [TRACE] [pool-2-thread-78]     Retrieving image from http://&lt;censored&gt;:7020/ISAPI/Streaming/channels/1/picture\r\n    2022-05-04 12:40:00.183 [TRACE] [pool-2-thread-78]     Using authorization header of &#39;Basic &lt;censored&gt;&#39;\r\n    2022-05-04 12:40:00.491 [ERROR] [pool-2-thread-78]     Error retrieving image, status code is 401\r\n\r\nHowever, what actually gets sent over TCP does not include the Authorization header. The following is a &quot;Follow TCP&quot; dump from Wireshark:\r\n\r\n    GET /ISAPI/Streaming/channels/1/picture HTTP/1.1\r\n    Content-Length: 0\r\n    Host: &lt;censored&gt;:7020\r\n    User-Agent: Java-http-client/17.0.3\r\n\r\n    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\r\n    Date: Wed, 04 May 2022 12:39:59 GMT\r\n    Server: webserver\r\n    X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\r\n    Content-Length: 178\r\n    Content-Type: text/html\r\n    Connection: close\r\n    WWW-Authenticate: Digest qop=&quot;auth&quot;, realm=&quot;&lt;censored&gt;&quot;, nonce=&quot;&lt;censored&gt;&quot;, stale=&quot;FALSE&quot;\r\n\r\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Document Error: Unauthorized&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\r\n    &lt;body&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Access Error: 401 -- Unauthorized&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Authentication Error&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;/body&gt;\r\n    &lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\nI know the response asks for Digest authorization, and I&#39;m using Basic. That&#39;s not the point, the camera supports basic authorization as well. **The point is, the &quot;Authorization:&quot; header is not even sent with the request.**\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s hard to find any good guides for using Java17 native HttpClient, as most of them cover the Apache one. I found one from [Baeldung][1], but it covers the Java9. The [JavaDoc][2] is of little help, either. I am also using Authenticator, as Baeldung suggested, but it doesn&#39;t kick in, either.\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.baeldung.com/java-9-http-client\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpRequest.Builder.html#header(java.lang.String,java.lang.String)","title":"java.net.http.HttpRequest not sending &quot;Authorization:&quot; header - why?","body":"<p>I'm trying to download an image from a HTTP camera.

I'm using the following code:</p>\n<pre><code>protected BufferedImage retrieveImage(URI uri) throws IOException, InterruptedException {\n    log.trace(&quot;Using authorization header of '{}'&quot;, basicAuthString);\n    HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()\n                                     .uri(uri)\n                                     .header(&quot;Authorization&quot;, basicAuthString)\n                                     .GET()\n                                     .timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(20))\n                                     .build();\n    return retrieveImage(request);\n}\n\nprivate BufferedImage retrieveImage(HttpRequest request) throws IOException, InterruptedException {\n    HttpResponse&lt;byte[]&gt; response = null;\n    try {\n        response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofByteArray());\n    } catch (ConnectException ex) {\n        log.error(&quot;Connection refused when downloading image from &quot; + uri.toString());\n        return null;\n    }\n    if (response.statusCode() != 200) { // ok\n        log.error(&quot;Error retrieving image, status code is {}&quot;, response.statusCode());\n        return null;\n    }\n    ByteArrayInputStream bis   = new ByteArrayInputStream(response.body());\n    BufferedImage        image = ImageIO.read(bis);\n    return image;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The HttpClient variable (client in the above code) is created by:</p>\n<pre><code>            this.client = HttpClient.newBuilder()\n                                .connectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))\n                                .followRedirects(HttpClient.Redirect.NORMAL)\n                                .authenticator(new Authenticator() {\n                                    @Override\n                                    protected PasswordAuthentication getPasswordAuthentication() {\n                                        return new PasswordAuthentication(camera.getLogin(), camera.getPassword().toCharArray());\n                                    }\n                                })\n                                .version(HttpClient.Version.HTTP_1_1)\n                                .build();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since I'm using Basic authorization, I can pre-calculate the auth header and store it internally. And this code is executed, as in the logs I can see the following:</p>\n<pre><code>2022-05-04 12:40:00.183 [TRACE] [pool-2-thread-78]     Retrieving image from http://&lt;censored&gt;:7020/ISAPI/Streaming/channels/1/picture\n2022-05-04 12:40:00.183 [TRACE] [pool-2-thread-78]     Using authorization header of 'Basic &lt;censored&gt;'\n2022-05-04 12:40:00.491 [ERROR] [pool-2-thread-78]     Error retrieving image, status code is 401\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, what actually gets sent over TCP does not include the Authorization header. The following is a &quot;Follow TCP&quot; dump from Wireshark:</p>\n<pre><code>GET /ISAPI/Streaming/channels/1/picture HTTP/1.1\nContent-Length: 0\nHost: &lt;censored&gt;:7020\nUser-Agent: Java-http-client/17.0.3\n\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nDate: Wed, 04 May 2022 12:39:59 GMT\nServer: webserver\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nContent-Length: 178\nContent-Type: text/html\nConnection: close\nWWW-Authenticate: Digest qop=&quot;auth&quot;, realm=&quot;&lt;censored&gt;&quot;, nonce=&quot;&lt;censored&gt;&quot;, stale=&quot;FALSE&quot;\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Document Error: Unauthorized&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Access Error: 401 -- Unauthorized&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Authentication Error&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I know the response asks for Digest authorization, and I'm using Basic. That's not the point, the camera supports basic authorization as well. <strong>The point is, the &quot;Authorization:&quot; header is not even sent with the request.</strong></p>\n<p>It's hard to find any good guides for using Java17 native HttpClient, as most of them cover the Apache one. I found one from <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/java-9-http-client\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baeldung</a>, but it covers the Java9. The <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpRequest.Builder.html#header(java.lang.String,java.lang.String)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JavaDoc</a> is of little help, either. I am also using Authenticator, as Baeldung suggested, but it doesn't kick in, either.</p>\n<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","database","hibernate","jpa"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":480617,"reputation":2495,"user_id":893952,"accept_rate":57,"display_name":"Harry Coder"},"score":0,"creation_date":1671854907,"post_id":74903540,"comment_id":132189057,"body_markdown":"You can remove the field `key` in the query, so the field won&#39;t be updated.","body":"You can remove the field <code>key</code> in the query, so the field won&#39;t be updated."},{"owner":{"account_id":22402724,"reputation":101,"user_id":16612843,"display_name":"Seema Sharma"},"score":0,"creation_date":1671861230,"post_id":74903540,"comment_id":132189525,"body_markdown":"From which query?

And for that, you don&#39;t need to download the whole JavaFX SDK, you can include it via dependencies from Maven Central.\r\n\r\nSo edit your `build.gradle` file, that looks like:\r\n\r\n    apply plugin: &#39;java&#39;\r\n    apply plugin: &#39;application&#39;\r\n    \r\n    repositories {\r\n        jcenter()\r\n        maven {\r\n            url &#39;http://nexus.gluonhq.com/nexus/content/repositories/releases&#39;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    mainClassName = &#39;com.gluonapplication.GluonDesktop&#39;\r\n    \r\n    dependencies {\r\n        compile &#39;com.gluonhq:particle:1.1.3&#39;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd add the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. According to the guide for [Gradle](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#gradle), add a way to find which is your platform:\r\n\r\n        apply plugin: &#39;java&#39;\r\n        apply plugin: &#39;application&#39;\r\n    \r\n        def currentOS = org.gradle.internal.os.OperatingSystem.current()\r\n        def platform\r\n        if (currentOS.isWindows()) {\r\n            platform = &#39;win&#39;\r\n        } else if (currentOS.isLinux()) {\r\n            platform = &#39;linux&#39;\r\n        } else if (currentOS.isMacOsX()) {\r\n            platform = &#39;mac&#39;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        repositories {\r\n            jcenter()\r\n            maven {\r\n                url &#39;http://nexus.gluonhq.com/nexus/content/repositories/releases&#39;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        mainClassName = &#39;com.gluonapplication.GluonDesktop&#39;\r\n    \r\n\r\n2. Add the JavaFX dependencies for your platform: \r\n    \r\n        dependencies {\r\n            compile &quot;org.openjfx:javafx-base:11:${platform}&quot;\r\n            compile &quot;org.openjfx:javafx-graphics:11:${platform}&quot;\r\n            compile &quot;org.openjfx:javafx-controls:11:${platform}&quot;\r\n            compile &quot;org.openjfx:javafx-fxml:11:${platform}&quot;\r\n    \r\n3. Add the ControlsFX dependency compatible with Java 9+ (by default is using 8.40.14 which was for Java 8) and add the `javax.annotation` dependency, that is not part of Java 9+:\r\n\r\n            compile &#39;com.gluonhq:particle:1.1.3&#39;\r\n            compile &#39;org.controlsfx:controlsfx:9.0.0&#39;\r\n            compile &#39;javax.annotation:javax.annotation-api:1.3.1&#39;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n4. According to the guide, you need to add the module-path and add the required modules to the compiler arguments: \r\n\r\n        compileJava {\r\n            doFirst {\r\n                options.compilerArgs = [\r\n                        &#39;--module-path&#39;, classpath.asPath,\r\n                        &#39;--add-modules&#39;, &#39;javafx.controls,javafx.fxml&#39;\r\n                ]\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n5. And the same for the run arguments. In this case, the access to private API (due to some requirement of ControlsFX), can be done with `--add-exports`:\r\n    \r\n        run {\r\n            doFirst {\r\n                jvmArgs = [\r\n                        &#39;--module-path&#39;, classpath.asPath,\r\n                        &#39;--add-modules&#39;, &#39;javafx.controls,javafx.fxml&#39;,\r\n                        &#39;--add-exports&#39;, &#39;javafx.base/com.sun.javafx.runtime=ALL-UNNAMED&#39;,\r\n                        &#39;--add-exports&#39;, &#39;javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.scene=ALL-UNNAMED&#39;,\r\n                        &#39;--add-exports&#39;, &#39;javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.scene.traversal=ALL-UNNAMED&#39;,\r\n    \r\n                ]\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nSave and sync the changes and you should be able to run your Gluon Desktop project.\r\n\r\n[![Gluon Desktop][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/WgklJ.png","title":"I don&#39;t know what i make wrong for the Gluon Start","body":"<p>The Gluon plugin 2.7.0 was released a while ago, mainly to create Gluon Desktop or Gluon Mobile applications with Java 8.</p>\n\n<p>If you are using now Java 11, until there is a new release of the Gluon plugin, you will have to update the build.gradle file.</p>\n\n<p>I'd suggest you have a look at how to get started with JavaFX 11 in this <a href=\"https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#introduction\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">guide</a>, and check this <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52467561/intellij-cant-recognize-javafx-11-with-openjdk-11\">question</a> about adding JavaFX 11 to a project in IntelliJ.</p>\n\n<p>When you use the Gluon plugin you are creating a Gradle project.

The providers list is where you code configure the JSON provider on the client.  In particular, you see the namespace mapping.  This needs to match what is on your server side configuration.  I don&#39;t know much about Jettison options so I&#39;m not much help on manipulating all of the various knobs for controlling the marshalling process.\r\n 2. Jettison in CXF works by marshalling XML from a JAXB provider into JSON.  So you have to ensure that the payload objects are all marked up (or otherwise configured) to marshall as application/xml before you can have them marshall as JSON.  If you know of a way around this (other than writing your own message body writer), I&#39;d love to hear about it.\r\n 3. I use spring on the server so my configuration there is all xml stuff.  Essentially, you need to go through the same process to add the JSONProvider to the service with the same namespace configuration.  Don&#39;t have code for that handy but I imagine it will mirror the client side fairly well.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit dirty as an example but will hopefully get you going.\r\n\r\n**Edit2:** An example of a message body writer that is based on xstream to avoid jaxb.\r\n\r\n    @Produces ( &quot;application/json&quot; )\r\n    @Consumes ( &quot;application/json&quot; )\r\n    @Provider\r\n    public class XstreamJsonProvider implements MessageBodyReader&lt;Object&gt;,\r\n        MessageBodyWriter&lt;Object&gt; {\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean isWriteable ( Class&lt;?&gt; type, Type genericType, \r\n        Annotation[] annotations, MediaType mediaType ) {\r\n        return MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE.equals ( mediaType ) \r\n            &amp;&amp; type.equals ( Demo.class );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public long getSize ( Object t, Class&lt;?&gt; type, Type genericType, \r\n        Annotation[] annotations, MediaType mediaType ) {\r\n        // I&#39;m being lazy - should compute the actual size\r\n        return -1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void writeTo ( Object t, Class&lt;?&gt; type, Type genericType, \r\n        Annotation[] annotations, MediaType mediaType, \r\n        MultivaluedMap&lt;String, Object&gt; httpHeaders, OutputStream entityStream ) \r\n        throws IOException, WebApplicationException {\r\n        // deal with thread safe use of xstream, etc.\r\n        XStream xstream = new XStream ( new JettisonMappedXmlDriver () );\r\n        xstream.setMode ( XStream.NO_REFERENCES );\r\n        // add safer encoding, error handling, etc.\r\n        xstream.toXML ( t, entityStream );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean isReadable ( Class&lt;?&gt; type, Type genericType, \r\n        Annotation[] annotations, MediaType mediaType ) {\r\n        return MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE.equals ( mediaType ) \r\n            &amp;&amp; type.equals ( Demo.class );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public Object readFrom ( Class&lt;Object&gt; type, Type genericType, \r\n        Annotation[] annotations, MediaType mediaType, \r\n        MultivaluedMap&lt;String, String&gt; httpHeaders, InputStream entityStream ) \r\n        throws IOException, WebApplicationException {\r\n        // add error handling, etc.\r\n        XStream xstream = new XStream ( new JettisonMappedXmlDriver () );\r\n        return xstream.fromXML ( entityStream );\r\n    }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    //now your client just needs this\r\n    List providers = new ArrayList ();\r\n    XstreamJsonProvider jsonProvider = new XstreamJsonProvider ();\r\n    providers.add ( jsonProvider );\r\n    TestApi proxy = JAXRSClientFactory.create ( url, TestApi.class, \r\n        providers, true );\r\n\r\n    Demo d = proxy.getDemo ();\r\n    if ( d != null ) {\r\n        System.out.println ( d.id + &quot;:&quot; + d.name );\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe sample code is missing the parts for robust media type support, error handling, thread safety, etc.  But, it ought to get you around the jaxb issue with minimal code.\r\n\r\n**EDIT 3 - sample server side configuration**\r\nAs I said before, my server side is spring configured.  Here is a sample configuration that works to wire in the provider:\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n    &lt;beans xmlns=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans&quot;\r\n\txmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\r\n\txmlns:jaxrs=&quot;http://cxf.apache.org/jaxrs&quot;\r\n\txmlns:cxf=&quot;http://cxf.apache.org/core&quot;\r\n\txsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans\r\n\thttp://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd\r\n        http://cxf.apache.org/jaxrs http://cxf.apache.org/schemas/jaxrs.xsd\r\n        http://cxf.apache.org/core http://cxf.apache.org/schemas/core.xsd&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;import resource=&quot;classpath:META-INF/cxf/cxf.xml&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;jaxrs:server id=&quot;TestApi&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;jaxrs:serviceBeans&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;ref bean=&quot;testApi&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/jaxrs:serviceBeans&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;jaxrs:providers&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;bean id=&quot;xstreamJsonProvider&quot; class=&quot;webtests.rest.XstreamJsonProvider&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/jaxrs:providers&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/jaxrs:server&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;bean id=&quot;testApi&quot; class=&quot;webtests.rest.TestApi&quot;&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/bean&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;/beans&gt;\r\n\r\nI have also noted that in the latest rev of cxf that I&#39;m using there is a difference in the media types, so the example above on the xstream message body reader/writer needs a quick modification where isWritable/isReadable change to:\r\n\r\n    return MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE.getType ().equals ( mediaType.getType () )\r\n        &amp;&amp; MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE.getSubtype ().equals ( mediaType.getSubtype () )\r\n        &amp;&amp; type.equals ( Demo.class );\r\n\r\n**EDIT 4 - non-spring configuration**\r\nUsing your servlet container of choice, configure\r\n\r\n    org.apache.cxf.jaxrs.servlet.CXFNonSpringJaxrsServlet\r\n\r\nwith at least 2 init params of:\r\n\r\n    jaxrs.serviceClasses\r\n    jaxrs.providers\r\n\r\nwhere the serviceClasses is a space separated list of the service implementations you want bound, such as the TestApi mentioned above and the providers is a space separated list of message body providers, such as the XstreamJsonProvider mentioned above.  In tomcat you might add the following to web.xml:\r\n\r\n    &lt;servlet&gt;\r\n        &lt;servlet-name&gt;cxfservlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\r\n        &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.apache.cxf.jaxrs.servlet.CXFNonSpringJaxrsServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;\r\n        &lt;init-param&gt;\r\n            &lt;param-name&gt;jaxrs.serviceClasses&lt;/param-name&gt;\r\n            &lt;param-value&gt;webtests.rest.TestApi&lt;/param-value&gt;\r\n        &lt;/init-param&gt;\r\n        &lt;init-param&gt;\r\n            &lt;param-name&gt;jaxrs.providers&lt;/param-name&gt;\r\n            &lt;param-value&gt;webtests.rest.XstreamJsonProvider&lt;/param-value&gt;\r\n        &lt;/init-param&gt;\r\n        &lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;\r\n    &lt;/servlet&gt;\r\n\r\nThat is pretty much the quickest way to run it without spring.  If you are not using a servlet container, you would need to configure the JAXRSServerFactoryBean.setProviders with an instance of XstreamJsonProvider and set the service implementation via the JAXRSServerFactoryBean.setResourceProvider method.  Check the CXFNonSpringJaxrsServlet.init method to see how they do it when setup in a servlet container.\r\n\r\nThat ought to get you going no matter your scenario.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://cxf.apache.org/docs/jax-rs-data-bindings.html#JAX-RSDataBindings-JSONsupport","title":"CXF: No message body writer found for class - automatically mapping non-simple resources","body":"<p>It isn't quite out of the box but CXF does support JSON bindings to rest services.

So you have to ensure that the payload objects are all marked up (or otherwise configured) to marshall as application/xml before you can have them marshall as JSON.  If you know of a way around this (other than writing your own message body writer), I'd love to hear about it.</li>\n<li>I use spring on the server so my configuration there is all xml stuff.  Essentially, you need to go through the same process to add the JSONProvider to the service with the same namespace configuration.  Don't have code for that handy but I imagine it will mirror the client side fairly well.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is a bit dirty as an example but will hopefully get you going.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit2:</strong> An example of a message body writer that is based on xstream to avoid jaxb.</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Produces ( \"application/json\" )\n@Consumes ( \"application/json\" )\n@Provider\npublic class XstreamJsonProvider implements MessageBodyReader&lt;Object&gt;,\n    MessageBodyWriter&lt;Object&gt; {\n\n@Override\npublic boolean isWriteable ( Class&lt;?&gt; type, Type genericType, \n    Annotation[] annotations, MediaType mediaType ) {\n    return MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE.equals ( mediaType ) \n        &amp;&amp; type.equals ( Demo.class );\n}\n\n@Override\npublic long getSize ( Object t, Class&lt;?&gt; type, Type genericType, \n    Annotation[] annotations, MediaType mediaType ) {\n    // I'm being lazy - should compute the actual size\n    return -1;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void writeTo ( Object t, Class&lt;?&gt; type, Type genericType, \n    Annotation[] annotations, MediaType mediaType, \n    MultivaluedMap&lt;String, Object&gt; httpHeaders, OutputStream entityStream ) \n    throws IOException, WebApplicationException {\n    // deal with thread safe use of xstream, etc.\n    XStream xstream = new XStream ( new JettisonMappedXmlDriver () );\n    xstream.setMode ( XStream.NO_REFERENCES );\n    // add safer encoding, error handling, etc.\n    xstream.toXML ( t, entityStream );\n}\n\n@Override\npublic boolean isReadable ( Class&lt;?&gt; type, Type genericType, \n    Annotation[] annotations, MediaType mediaType ) {\n    return MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE.equals ( mediaType ) \n        &amp;&amp; type.equals ( Demo.class );\n}\n\n@Override\npublic Object readFrom ( Class&lt;Object&gt; type, Type genericType, \n    Annotation[] annotations, MediaType mediaType, \n    MultivaluedMap&lt;String, String&gt; httpHeaders, InputStream entityStream ) \n    throws IOException, WebApplicationException {\n    // add error handling, etc.\n    XStream xstream = new XStream ( new JettisonMappedXmlDriver () );\n    return xstream.fromXML ( entityStream );\n}\n}\n\n//now your client just needs this\nList providers = new ArrayList ();\nXstreamJsonProvider jsonProvider = new XstreamJsonProvider ();\nproviders.add ( jsonProvider );\nTestApi proxy = JAXRSClientFactory.create ( url, TestApi.class, \n    providers, true );\n\nDemo d = proxy.getDemo ();\nif ( d != null ) {\n    System.out.println ( d.id + \":\" + d.name );\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The sample code is missing the parts for robust media type support, error handling, thread safety, etc.  But, it ought to get you around the jaxb issue with minimal code.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 3 - sample server side configuration</strong>\nAs I said before, my server side is spring configured.  Here is a sample configuration that works to wire in the provider:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;beans xmlns=\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans\"\nxmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\nxmlns:jaxrs=\"http://cxf.apache.org/jaxrs\"\nxmlns:cxf=\"http://cxf.apache.org/core\"\nxsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans\nhttp://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd\n    http://cxf.apache.org/jaxrs http://cxf.apache.org/schemas/jaxrs.xsd\n    http://cxf.apache.org/core http://cxf.apache.org/schemas/core.xsd\"&gt;\n\n&lt;import resource=\"classpath:META-INF/cxf/cxf.xml\" /&gt;\n\n&lt;jaxrs:server id=\"TestApi\"&gt;\n    &lt;jaxrs:serviceBeans&gt;\n        &lt;ref bean=\"testApi\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/jaxrs:serviceBeans&gt;\n    &lt;jaxrs:providers&gt;\n        &lt;bean id=\"xstreamJsonProvider\" class=\"webtests.rest.XstreamJsonProvider\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/jaxrs:providers&gt;\n&lt;/jaxrs:server&gt;\n\n&lt;bean id=\"testApi\" class=\"webtests.rest.TestApi\"&gt;\n&lt;/bean&gt;\n\n&lt;/beans&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I have also noted that in the latest rev of cxf that I'm using there is a difference in the media types, so the example above on the xstream message body reader/writer needs a quick modification where isWritable/isReadable change to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>return MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE.getType ().equals ( mediaType.getType () )\n    &amp;&amp; MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE.getSubtype ().equals ( mediaType.getSubtype () )\n    &amp;&amp; type.equals ( Demo.class );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 4 - non-spring configuration</strong>\nUsing your servlet container of choice, configure</p>\n\n<pre><code>org.apache.cxf.jaxrs.servlet.CXFNonSpringJaxrsServlet\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>with at least 2 init params of:</p>\n\n<pre><code>jaxrs.serviceClasses\njaxrs.providers\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where the serviceClasses is a space separated list of the service implementations you want bound, such as the TestApi mentioned above and the providers is a space separated list of message body providers, such as the XstreamJsonProvider mentioned above.  In tomcat you might add the following to web.xml:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;servlet&gt;\n    &lt;servlet-name&gt;cxfservlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\n    &lt;servlet-class&gt;org.apache.cxf.jaxrs.servlet.CXFNonSpringJaxrsServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;\n    &lt;init-param&gt;\n        &lt;param-name&gt;jaxrs.serviceClasses&lt;/param-name&gt;\n        &lt;param-value&gt;webtests.rest.TestApi&lt;/param-value&gt;\n    &lt;/init-param&gt;\n    &lt;init-param&gt;\n        &lt;param-name&gt;jaxrs.providers&lt;/param-name&gt;\n        &lt;param-value&gt;webtests.rest.XstreamJsonProvider&lt;/param-value&gt;\n    &lt;/init-param&gt;\n    &lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;\n&lt;/servlet&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That is pretty much the quickest way to run it without spring.  If you are not using a servlet container, you would need to configure the JAXRSServerFactoryBean.setProviders with an instance of XstreamJsonProvider and set the service implementation via the JAXRSServerFactoryBean.setResourceProvider method.  Check the CXFNonSpringJaxrsServlet.init method to see how they do it when setup in a servlet container.</p>\n\n<p>That ought to get you going no matter your scenario.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1152519,"reputation":733,"user_id":1133928,"display_name":"Sergey Beryozkin"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1334513973,"creation_date":1334513973,"answer_id":10164730,"question_id":6312030,"body_markdown":"You can also configure CXFNonSpringJAXRSServlet (assuming JSONProvider is used):\r\n\r\n    &lt;init-param&gt;\r\n      &lt;param-name&gt;jaxrs.providers&lt;/param-name&gt;\r\n      &lt;param-value&gt;\r\n          org.apache.cxf.jaxrs.provider.JSONProvider\r\n          (writeXsiType=false)\r\n      &lt;/param-value&gt; \r\n    &lt;/init-param&gt;\r\n","title":"CXF: No message body writer found for class - automatically mapping non-simple resources","body":"<p>You can also configure CXFNonSpringJAXRSServlet (assuming JSONProvider is used):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;init-param&gt;\n  &lt;param-name&gt;jaxrs.providers&lt;/param-name&gt;\n  &lt;param-value&gt;\n      org.apache.cxf.jaxrs.provider.JSONProvider\n      (writeXsiType=false)\n  &lt;/param-value&gt; \n&lt;/init-param&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":468218,"reputation":2281,"user_id":874076,"accept_rate":84,"display_name":"Kilokahn"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1367418156,"creation_date":1367418156,"answer_id":16319917,"question_id":6312030,"body_markdown":"If you are using jaxrs:client route of configuring, you can choose to use the JacksonJsonProvider to provide \r\n\r\n    &lt;jaxrs:client id=&quot;serviceId&quot;\r\n        serviceClass=&quot;classname&quot;\r\n        address=&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;jaxrs:providers&gt;\r\n            &lt;bean class=&quot;org.codehaus.jackson.jaxrs.JacksonJsonProvider&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;property name=&quot;mapper&quot; ref=&quot;jacksonMapper&quot; /&gt;\r\n            &lt;/bean&gt;\r\n        &lt;/jaxrs:providers&gt;\r\n    &lt;/jaxrs:client&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;bean id=&quot;jacksonMapper&quot; class=&quot;org.codehaus.jackson.map.ObjectMapper&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/bean&gt;\r\n\r\nYou need to include the jackson-mapper-asl and jackson-jaxr artifacts in your classpath\r\n","title":"CXF: No message body writer found for class - automatically mapping non-simple resources","body":"<p>If you are using jaxrs:client route of configuring, you can choose to use the JacksonJsonProvider to provide </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;jaxrs:client id=\"serviceId\"\n    serviceClass=\"classname\"\n    address=\"\"&gt;\n    &lt;jaxrs:providers&gt;\n        &lt;bean class=\"org.codehaus.jackson.jaxrs.JacksonJsonProvider\"&gt;\n            &lt;property name=\"mapper\" ref=\"jacksonMapper\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/bean&gt;\n    &lt;/jaxrs:providers&gt;\n&lt;/jaxrs:client&gt;\n\n&lt;bean id=\"jacksonMapper\" class=\"org.codehaus.jackson.map.ObjectMapper\"&gt;\n&lt;/bean&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You need to include the jackson-mapper-asl and jackson-jaxr artifacts in your classpath</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2426870,"reputation":238,"user_id":2118606,"accept_rate":43,"display_name":"Abhishek Ranjan"},"score":1,"creation_date":1447924795,"post_id":26679847,"comment_id":55365175,"body_markdown":"Can you share what you did do to register the provider class in CXF 2.7?","body":"Can you share what you did do to register the provider class in CXF 2.7?"},{"owner":{"account_id":111587,"reputation":11539,"user_id":294702,"accept_rate":90,"display_name":"MonoThreaded"},"score":0,"creation_date":1589340626,"post_id":26679847,"comment_id":109252270,"body_markdown":"what is the xmlns for jaxrs?","body":"what is the xmlns for jaxrs?"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2170364,"reputation":311,"user_id":1922538,"display_name":"Ross H Mills III"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":9,"is_accepted":false,"score":9,"last_activity_date":1414774846,"creation_date":1414774846,"answer_id":26679847,"question_id":6312030,"body_markdown":"I encountered this problem while upgrading from CXF 2.7.0 to 3.0.2.
