Also note that the first characters have a greater *impact* on the resulting hash code (more often multiplied by 31).\r\n\r\nThe basic idea of the two first algorithm is to increment the characters until the hash code turns negative, starting with the left-most character since it has a greater weight. The searched string must have the character previous to the one that caused it to overflow on each position but the last one.\r\n\r\nThe code starts testing the strings `&quot;A&quot;, &quot;AA&quot;, &quot;AAA&quot;, ...` until one starts returning a negative value - the previous string is used as starting value.  \r\nNow it starts incrementing the first character up to `Z` or until a string with a negative hash is found.

Problem seems to be in the parser and not in the short form provider."},{"owner":{"account_id":64226,"reputation":480,"user_id":189723,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"ThomasFrancart"},"score":0,"creation_date":1692955493,"post_id":76951595,"comment_id":135698084,"body_markdown":"Issue submitted at https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi/issues/1111","body":"Issue submitted at <a href=\"https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi/issues/1111\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">github.com/owlcs/owlapi/issues/1111</a>"}],"owner":{"account_id":64226,"reputation":480,"user_id":189723,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"ThomasFrancart"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1692891606,"creation_date":1692694167,"question_id":76951595,"body_markdown":"I am trying to parse a class expression in Manchester syntax written using rdfs:label, just like one would enter in Prot&#233;g&#233; with view set to _&quot;render by label&quot;_, so something like `Pizza and not(hasTopping some &#39;Meat topping&#39;)` instead of `Pizza and not(hasTopping some MeatTopping)`.\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t find a way to do that.

The comments say this:\r\n\r\n&gt; `ThreadLocalMap` is a customized hash map suitable only for maintaining thread local values.

If stale entry is encountered in a get, set, insert or remove operation on the map, the corresponding value is nulled.  In some cases, the code does a partial scan heuristic, but the only situation where we can *guarantee* that all stale map entries are removed is when the hash table is resized (grows).\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nSo ...\r\n\r\n&gt; Then during context undeploy application classloader becomes a subject for garbage collection, but thread is from a thread pool so it does not die.

The application comprises around 15 Spring Batch classes, each responsible for loading a different dataset.

Notably, some readers take considerable time (minutes) to fetch data, causing even the faster readers to wait. I feel it is happening not only with readers but with processor and writer too.

The application comprises around 15 Spring Batch classes, each responsible for loading a different dataset. One of the class/job FitsVendorJob has been posted below and all other classes also been designed in the same way.</p>\n<p>I've encountered a performance challenge: while one class's readers are retrieving data, the readers from other classes are need to wait. Notably, some readers take considerable time (minutes) to fetch data, causing even the faster readers to wait. I feel it is happening not only with readers but with processor and writer too.  I believe I designed all the classes/jobs to be independent of each other but even then there seems to be dependency.</p>\n<p>My expected job flow would be,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Execute truncateFitsVendorTable and truncateSrcVendorTable steps in\nparallel.</li>\n<li>Proceed with the processVendorKeyConstraints step.</li>\n<li>Run loadWFitsVendorTable and loadSrcVendorTable steps in parallel.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I have googled, read the docs, but I haven't yet found a solution to this problem.

I still need to register in forge as that is how it updates but adding PlayerEntity does not work when I use @SubscribeEvent</p>\n<pre><code>package blitz.weapon.weaponmod;\n\nimport net.minecraft.block.Block;\nimport net.minecraft.block.Blocks;\nimport net.minecraft.client.MainWindow;\nimport net.minecraft.client.Minecraft;\nimport net.minecraft.entity.Entity;\nimport net.minecraft.entity.LivingEntity;\nimport net.minecraft.entity.player.PlayerAbilities;\nimport net.minecraft.entity.player.PlayerEntity;\nimport net.minecraft.item.Item;\nimport net.minecraft.item.ItemGroup;\nimport net.minecraft.item.ItemStack;\nimport net.minecraft.potion.EffectInstance;\nimport net.minecraft.potion.Effects;\nimport net.minecraft.util.Hand;\nimport net.minecraft.util.math.BlockPos;\nimport net.minecraft.world.World;\nimport net.minecraftforge.common.MinecraftForge;\nimport net.minecraftforge.common.capabilities.Capability;\nimport net.minecraftforge.common.capabilities.CapabilityDispatcher;\nimport net.minecraftforge.event.RegistryEvent;\nimport net.minecraftforge.event.TickEvent;\nimport net.minecraftforge.event.world.NoteBlockEvent;\nimport net.minecraftforge.eventbus.api.SubscribeEvent;\nimport net.minecraftforge.fml.InterModComms;\nimport net.minecraftforge.fml.RegistryObject;\nimport net.minecraftforge.fml.common.Mod;\nimport net.minecraftforge.fml.event.lifecycle.FMLClientSetupEvent;\nimport net.minecraftforge.fml.event.lifecycle.FMLCommonSetupEvent;\nimport net.minecraftforge.fml.event.lifecycle.InterModEnqueueEvent;\nimport net.minecraftforge.fml.event.lifecycle.InterModProcessEvent;\nimport net.minecraftforge.fml.event.server.FMLServerStartingEvent;\nimport net.minecraftforge.fml.javafmlmod.FMLJavaModLoadingContext;\nimport net.minecraftforge.registries.DeferredRegister;\nimport net.minecraftforge.registries.ForgeRegistries;\nimport org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;\nimport org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;\n\nimport javax.annotation.Nullable;\nimport java.util.Objects;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\n// The value here should match an entry in the META-INF/mods.toml file\n@Mod(&quot;weaponmod&quot;)\npublic class Weaponmod {\n\n    // Directly reference a log4j logger.\n    private static final Logger LOGGER = LogManager.getLogger();\n    public static final DeferredRegister&lt;Item&gt;

I think you'll need to put the beginning of the string in a group, and then use <code>$1</code> in the replacement string to copy the beginning:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Pattern pat = Pattern.compile(\"^((?:[^']|'[^']*')*?)a\\\\.b\\\\.c\");\nMatcher m = pat.matcher(source);\nif (m.find()) {\n    result = m.replaceFirst(\"$1replacement\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm not sure <code>replaceAll</code> works with this, so if you want to replace all of them, you may need to loop.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3218909,"reputation":7878,"user_id":2716792,"display_name":"alpha bravo"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1394039380,"creation_date":1394039380,"answer_id":22204470,"question_id":22204098,"body_markdown":"use this pattern : `a\\.b\\.c(?=(([^&#39;]*&#39;){2})*[^&#39;]*$)` [Demo][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://regex101.com/r/fN6sS8","title":"Find a subtring in a string using a regular expression - JAVA","body":"<p>use this pattern : <code>a\\.b\\.c(?=(([^']*'){2})*[^']*$)</code> <a href=\"http://regex101.com/r/fN6sS8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Demo</a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":3971430,"reputation":57,"user_id":3275944,"accept_rate":0,"display_name":"user3275944"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":340,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1692872837,"creation_date":1394038353,"question_id":22204098,"body_markdown":"Suppose i have a string &quot; kk a.b.cjkmkc  jjkocc a.b.c. jjj &#39;a.b.ckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk &#39; &quot;\r\n\r\nI want to replace the substring a.b.c in the string which are only outside the single quote , but it is not working.\r\n\r\nHere is my code \r\n`\r\n\r\n    String str = &quot; kk a.b.cjkmkc  jjkocc a.b.c. jjj &#39;a.b.ckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk &#39; &quot;;\r\n     Pattern p = Pattern.compile(&quot;a\\\\.b\\\\.c&quot;);\r\n     Matcher m = p.matcher(str); \r\n     int x = m.find()\r\n     `\r\n                       ","title":"Find a subtring in a string using a regular expression - JAVA","body":"<p>Suppose i have a string \" kk a.b.cjkmkc  jjkocc a.b.c. jjj 'a.b.ckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk ' \"</p>\n\n<p>I want to replace the substring a.b.c in the string which are only outside the single quote , but it is not working.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my code \n`</p>\n\n<pre><code>String str = \" kk a.b.cjkmkc  jjkocc a.b.c. jjj 'a.b.ckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk ' \";\n Pattern p = Pattern.compile(\"a\\\\.b\\\\.c\");\n Matcher m = p.matcher(str); \n int x = m.find()\n `\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","selenium-webdriver","testng"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":-1,"reputation":1,"user_id":-1,"display_name":"Community"},"score":0,"creation_date":1692949408,"post_id":76967957,"comment_id":135696851,"body_markdown":"Please clarify your specific problem or provide additional details to highlight exactly what you need.

The application itself is configured to give out ID Tokens used for implicit and hybrid flows.\r\nThe Redirect URIs are configured to the home path of the Frontend application ( 2 versions, 1 for localhost and 1 for cloud deployed version )\r\nThe Token permission is set to `User.Read` in order to retrieve the profile details.\r\nThere is no exposed API configured.\r\n\r\nThe Frontend part works successfully. \r\nUpon Login I&#39;m redirected to the Azure Login and I can see I received a bunch of tokens ( `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `id_token` etc. ) being returned by the `/token` call.\r\n\r\nNow I&#39;m grabbing the access_token and send it to my BE for an API call.\r\nHowever on the BE I have the problem that the token cannot be validated with the following log message of `org.springframework.security` on `DEBUG`:\r\n```\r\nAuthenticationWebFilter      : Authentication failed: Failed to validate the token\r\n```\r\n\r\nI facilitated a multiple microsoft docs and also Baeldung and even Chat-GPT but all the variations don&#39;t seem to work for me, or rather it seems I&#39;m missing something.\r\n\r\nHere is my gradle dependency:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // Spring\r\n  implementation &quot;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator&quot;\r\n  implementation &quot;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-security&quot;\r\n  .....\r\n  implementation &quot;org.springframework.security:spring-security-oauth2-client&quot;\r\n  implementation &quot;org.springframework.security:spring-security-oauth2-jose&quot;\r\n  implementation &quot;org.springframework.security:spring-security-oauth2-resource-server&quot;\r\n  implementation &quot;org.springframework.session:spring-session-core&quot;\r\n  .....\r\n\r\n  // Azure AD\r\n  implementation &#39;com.azure.spring:spring-cloud-azure-starter-active-directory:5.4.0&#39;\r\n  implementation &#39;com.azure.spring:spring-cloud-azure-starter:5.4.0&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe two azure dependencies have been attempted standalone or in combination, however there seems to be no difference.\r\n\r\nFollowing now is my application.yml config:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspring:  \r\n  security:\r\n    oauth2:\r\n      resourceserver:\r\n        jwt:\r\n          issuer-uri: https://sts.windows.net/&lt;TENANT-ID&gt;/\r\n          jwk-set-uri: https://login.microsoftonline.com/&lt;TENANT-ID&gt;/discovery/v2.0/keys\r\n  cloud:\r\n    azure:\r\n      profile:\r\n        tenant-id: &lt;TENANT-ID&gt;\r\n        cloud-type: Azure\r\n      credential:\r\n        managed-identity-enabled: true\r\n        client-id: &lt;APPLICATION-ID&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have also previously used `https://login.microsoftonline.com/&lt;TENANT-ID&gt;/v2.0` for the `issuer-uri` but after decoding the access token I found out that the iss was using `sts.windows.net` as host\r\n\r\nLastly my security configuration in Spring:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  @Bean\r\n  @Order(2)\r\n  public SecurityWebFilterChain apiSecurity(\r\n      ServerHttpSecurity http,\r\n      OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer oAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer) {\r\n    http.securityMatcher(API_MATCHER)\r\n        .csrf().disable()\r\n        .authorizeExchange()\r\n        .anyExchange().authenticated();\r\n\r\n    oAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer.configure(http);\r\n\r\n    return http.build();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSnippet of the oAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  @Value(&quot;${spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.jwk-set-uri}&quot;)\r\n  private String jwksUrl;  \r\n\r\n  public void configure(ServerHttpSecurity http) {\r\n    http.oauth2ResourceServer(\r\n        oauth2ResourceServer -&gt; oauth2ResourceServer.jwt(\r\n            jwt -&gt; jwt.jwkSetUri(jwksUrl)));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe security configuration seems to be somewhat correct as my test version of the configurer behaves correctly during integration tests.\r\nIf I make a call to an endpoint without any mock JWT it returns `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` and when I provide a mock JWT the call returns `HTTP 200 OK` as expected.\r\n\r\nI sadly cannot look at Azure AD Logs and all I can control is the FE and BE.\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:**\r\n\r\nFE takes care of Azure AD Authentication and login, then sends the access token to the BE.\r\nBE tries to validate token with oAuth2ResourceServer pointing to Azure AD tenant and application.\r\nToken validation fails.
