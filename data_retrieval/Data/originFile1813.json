In a 2D array, I can check the length of all columns with something like this</p>\n<pre><code>int[][] a = {{5,3,4,6,7,8,9,1,2},\n             {6,7,2,1,9,5,3,4,8},\n             {1,9,8,3,4,2,5,6,7},\n             {8,5,9,7,6,1,4,2,3},\n             {4,2,6,8,5,3,7,9,1},\n             {7,1,3,9,2,4,8,5,6},\n             {9,6,1,5,3,7,2,8,4},\n             {2,8,7,4,1,9,6,3,5}};\nfor (int k = 0; k &lt; a.length; k++) {\n    if (a[k].length != 9) return false\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am not even sure if that is correct. How can I check the different rows? When I have a 4x4 matrix, and the last row only contains 3 values instead of 4, how can I find that out?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","html","angular","typescript"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":17147964,"reputation":1243,"user_id":12410533,"display_name":"Andrew Halil"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1638027011,"creation_date":1637756295,"answer_id":70095953,"question_id":70046084,"body_markdown":"The table rows have detached from the table DOM element, causing them to render in one cell. \r\n\r\nInstead of including the header and rows within the same component HTML, refactor them into respective components `app-contact-header` and `app-contact-list`. \r\n\r\nThe resulting HTML for `&lt;table&gt;` should include the above components wrapped within the `&lt;thead&gt;` and `&lt;tbody&gt;` elements as shown:\r\n\r\n    &lt;table class=&quot;table table-bordered&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;thead&gt;\r\n        &lt;tr app-contact-header&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n      &lt;/thead&gt;\r\n    \r\n      &lt;tbody&gt;\r\n        &lt;tr\r\n          app-contact-list\r\n          *ngFor=&quot;let itemElement of listData; let ind = index&quot;\r\n          [item]=&quot;itemElement&quot;\r\n          [i]=&quot;ind&quot;\r\n        &gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n      &lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n    &lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\nThe components will need to be declared with an `attribute selector` (not to be confused with [attribute directives][1]), in order to be injected into the HTML element `&lt;tr&gt;`.\r\n\r\n**app-contact-header**\r\n\r\n*HTML*\r\n\r\n    &lt;th&gt;Id&lt;/th&gt;\r\n    &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;\r\n    &lt;th&gt;Email&lt;/th&gt;\r\n    &lt;th&gt;Contact&lt;/th&gt;\r\n    &lt;th&gt;Action&lt;/th&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n*TS*\r\n\r\n    import { Component, OnInit } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    @Component({\r\n      selector: &#39;[app-contact-header]&#39;,\r\n      templateUrl: &#39;./contact-header.component.html&#39;,\r\n      styleUrls: [&#39;./contact-header.component.css&#39;],\r\n    })\r\n    export class ContactHeaderComponent implements OnInit {\r\n      constructor() {}\r\n    \r\n      ngOnInit() {}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n**app-contact-list** \r\n\r\n*HTML*\r\n\r\n    &lt;td class=&quot;col1&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;span&gt;{{ i + 1 }}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n    &lt;/td&gt;\r\n    &lt;td class=&quot;col2&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;span&gt;{{ item.name }}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n    &lt;/td&gt;\r\n    &lt;td class=&quot;col3&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;span&gt;{{ item.email }}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n    &lt;/td&gt;\r\n    &lt;td class=&quot;col4&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;span&gt;{{ item.contact }}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n    &lt;/td&gt;\r\n    &lt;td class=&quot;col5&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; type=&quot;button&quot;&gt;View&lt;/button&gt;\r\n      &lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; type=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/button&gt;\r\n      &lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; type=&quot;reset&quot; (click)=&quot;removeItem(item)&quot;&gt;\r\n        Delete\r\n      &lt;/button&gt;\r\n    &lt;/td&gt;\r\n\r\n*TS*\r\n\r\n    import { Component, Input, OnInit } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    @Component({\r\n      selector: &#39;[app-contact-list]&#39;,\r\n      templateUrl: &#39;./contact-list.component.html&#39;,\r\n      styleUrls: [&#39;./contact-list.component.css&#39;],\r\n    })\r\n    export class ContactListComponent implements OnInit {\r\n      @Input() item: any;\r\n      @Input() i: number;\r\n      constructor() {}\r\n    \r\n      ngOnInit() {}\r\n    \r\n      ...\r\n    \r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing HTML `&lt;table&gt;` elements is not responsive.

The program is written in Java. I got it all working on the same machine so I decided to try LAN. I converted the program to JAR files and I tried connecting my laptop to my PC (both are on the same network). The connection is successful but unfortunately **only** **1** message arrives to the server. As you can see in the code below, I send multiple messages (*Meaning that i write multiple times*) via `DataOutputStream`. One defines the datatype (in the following example 0 means that it&#39;s a String) and the other sends the actual message data. I also print the size of the packets in bytes and it always matches the size of the `DataOutputStream` instance.\r\n\r\n    DataOutputStream dOut = new DataOutputStream(clientSocket.getOutputStream());\r\n    String str = &quot;Hello&quot;;\r\n    //Type\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Type output size: 1&quot;);\r\n    dOut.writeByte(0);\r\n    //Message\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Message output size: &quot; + (str.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8).length + 2));\r\n    dOut.writeUTF(str);\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Length of all: &quot; + (dOut.size()));\r\n    dOut.flush();\r\n\r\nSo now when the data from the client is sent we need to handle it on the server, which the code below does. It retrieves the `InputStream` from the `Socket` called client and inserts it into the `DataInputStream`.

However, I think it is not unsolvable.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental principle should be **to follow and replace the type variables with actual parameter types all the way to `List&lt;E&gt;`**.\r\n\r\nConsider these two classes:\r\n```java\r\nclass B&lt;T&gt; extends AbstractList&lt;T&gt;{}\r\nclass A&lt;E&gt; extends B&lt;E&gt;{}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe type variable name used in the declaration of `B` is `T`, while when it is extended from in `A`, `E` is used. Hence, we cannot rely upon the declared name. \r\n\r\n- We **have to** follow the type variable name in the child class, replacing the variables with actual values in the parent class or interface. \r\n- This has to start from the `Field` till we hit `List&lt;E&gt;`. (I am not sure what happens when List comes in the heirarchy through more than one path. Hence, that case hasn&#39;t been handled below.)\r\n- When we replace `E` in `List` finally, we can conclude if it is `List&lt;Integer&gt;` or not.\r\n\r\nHere is a code that does this. It is quite some number of lines but is working for the cases you added (and a few more from my side).
