Therefore as you can see in `DiscountEntityPK.java`, although the composite private key consists of 2 columns:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage com.manios.product.discount;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.Serializable;\r\nimport java.util.Objects;\r\nimport jakarta.persistence.Column;\r\nimport jakarta.persistence.Id;\r\n\r\npublic class DiscountEntityPK implements Serializable {\r\n    private String companyId;\r\n    private long discountId;\r\n\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;company_id&quot;, nullable = false, length = 2)\r\n    @Id\r\n    public String getCompanyId() {\r\n        return companyId;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setCompanyId(String companyId) {\r\n        this.companyId = companyId;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;discount_id&quot;, nullable = false)\r\n    @Id\r\n    public long getDiscountId() {\r\n        return discountId;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setDiscountId(long discountId) {\r\n        this.discountId = discountId;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean equals(Object o) {\r\n        if (this == o) return true;\r\n        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\r\n        DiscountEntityPK that = (DiscountEntityPK) o;\r\n        return discountId == that.discountId &amp;&amp;\r\n                Objects.equals(companyId, that.companyId);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int hashCode() {\r\n\r\n        return Objects.hash(companyId, discountId);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe actual entity class, `DiscountEntity.java`, had 2 more fields annotated with the `@Id` annotation (search in the code for `INCORRECT ANNOTATION`)\r\n```java\r\npackage com.manios.product.discount;\r\n\r\nimport java.sql.Date;\r\nimport java.util.Objects;\r\nimport jakarta.persistence.Basic;\r\nimport jakarta.persistence.Column;\r\nimport jakarta.persistence.Entity;\r\nimport jakarta.persistence.Id;\r\nimport jakarta.persistence.IdClass;\r\nimport jakarta.persistence.Table;\r\n\r\n@Entity\r\n@Table(name = &quot;discount&quot;)\r\n@IdClass(DiscountEntityPK.class)\r\npublic class DiscountEntity {\r\n  private String companyId;\r\n  private long discountId;\r\n  private String discountType;\r\n  private Date fromDate;\r\n  private Date toDate;\r\n  private String discountText;\r\n  private long priority;\r\n  private long discountLevel;\r\n\r\n  @Id\r\n  @Column(name = &quot;company_id&quot;, nullable = false, length = 2)\r\n  public String getCompanyId() {\r\n    return companyId;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public void setCompanyId(String companyId) {\r\n    this.companyId = companyId;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Id\r\n  @Column(name = &quot;discount_id&quot;, nullable = false)\r\n  public long getDiscountId() {\r\n    return discountId;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public void setDiscountId(long discountId) {\r\n    this.discountId = discountId;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Basic\r\n  @Column(name = &quot;discount_type&quot;, nullable = false, length = 2)\r\n  public String getDiscountType() {\r\n    return discountType;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public void setDiscountType(String discountType) {\r\n    this.discountType = discountType;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Basic\r\n  @Column(name = &quot;from_date&quot;, nullable = false)\r\n  public Date getFromDate() {\r\n    return fromDate;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public void setFromDate(Date fromDate) {\r\n    this.fromDate = fromDate;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Basic\r\n  @Column(name = &quot;to_date&quot;, nullable = false)\r\n  public Date getToDate() {\r\n    return toDate;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public void setToDate(Date toDate) {\r\n    this.toDate = toDate;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Basic\r\n  @Column(name = &quot;disc_text&quot;, nullable = false, length = 240)\r\n  public String getDiscountText() {\r\n    return discountText;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public void setDiscountText(String discountText) {\r\n    this.discountText = discountText;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  //     ------------------------\r\n  @Id // &lt;-- INCORRECT ANNOTATION.

After replacing the `@Id` annotation with `@Basic` annotation in columns `&quot;discount_level&quot;` and `&quot;priority&quot;` the problem was fixed.

Don't forget to change <code>&quot;Title&quot;</code> in all three methods to whatever title you want to have.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>webView.setWebChromeClient(new WebChromeClient(){\n    @Override\n    public boolean onJsAlert(WebView view, String url, String message, JsResult result){\n        new AlertDialog.Builder(view.getContext())\n            .setTitle(&quot;Title&quot;)\n            .setMessage(message)\n            .setPositiveButton(&quot;OK&quot;, (DialogInterface dialog, int which) -&gt; result.confirm())\n            .setOnDismissListener((DialogInterface dialog) -&gt; result.confirm())\n            .create()\n            .show();\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean onJsConfirm(WebView view, String url, String message, JsResult result){\n        new AlertDialog.Builder(view.getContext())\n            .setTitle(&quot;Title&quot;)\n            .setMessage(message)\n            .setPositiveButton(&quot;OK&quot;, (DialogInterface dialog, int which) -&gt; result.confirm())\n            .setNegativeButton(&quot;Cancel&quot;, (DialogInterface dialog, int which) -&gt; result.cancel())\n            .setOnDismissListener((DialogInterface dialog) -&gt; result.cancel())\n            .create()\n            .show();\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean onJsPrompt(WebView view, String url, String message, String defaultValue, JsPromptResult result){\n        final EditText input = new EditText(view.getContext());\n        input.setInputType(InputType.TYPE_CLASS_TEXT);\n        input.setText(defaultValue);\n        new AlertDialog.Builder(view.getContext())\n            .setTitle(&quot;Title&quot;)\n            .setMessage(message)\n            .setView(input)\n            .setPositiveButton(&quot;OK&quot;, (DialogInterface dialog, int which) -&gt; result.confirm(input.getText().toString()))\n            .setNegativeButton(&quot;Cancel&quot;, (DialogInterface dialog, int which) -&gt; result.cancel())\n            .setOnDismissListener((DialogInterface dialog) -&gt; result.cancel())\n            .create()\n            .show();\n        return true;\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":20058566,"reputation":11,"user_id":14705750,"display_name":"Kirill H&#228;uptli"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1686507758,"creation_date":1680195803,"answer_id":75891069,"question_id":38053779,"body_markdown":"Here an example in Kotlin:\r\n\r\nAlso, VERY important not to forget to add `result.confirm()`, else your Webview will be frozen!\r\n\r\n    override fun onJsAlert(\r\n            view: WebView,\r\n            url: String,\r\n            message: String,\r\n            result: JsResult\r\n        ): Boolean {\r\n            val title = &quot;yourtitle&quot;\r\n            val dialog: AlertDialog =\r\n                AlertDialog.Builder(view.context).setTitle(title).setMessage(message)\r\n                    .setPositiveButton(&quot;OK&quot;,\r\n                        { dialog, which -&gt;\r\n                            result.confirm()\r\n                        }).create()\r\n            dialog.show()\r\n            return true\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a sidenote, for those people who searched for a WebViewClient() solution like me, you can use it and WebChromeClient() simultaneously, since not every override method is available in either type of browsers.
