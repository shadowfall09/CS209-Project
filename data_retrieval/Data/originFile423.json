I&#39;ll demonstrate both.\r\n\r\nAs a solution, you can reduce your check value, on line 13, of `count &lt; 255` to 127.  \r\nFor added persistence, you can use `Byte.MAX_VALUE`.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nif (nextByte == currentByte &amp;&amp; count &lt; 127) {\r\n    count++;\r\n} else {\r\n    os.write((byte) count);\r\n    os.write((byte) currentByte);\r\n    count = 1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, you can bit-mask your `count` value in the `decompression` method.\r\n\r\n```java\r\ncount = currentByte &amp; 0xff;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will return positive values for negative `byte` values.  \r\nFor example.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n-1 &amp; 0xff == 255\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as a recommendation, you can reduce both your `compress` and `decompress` methods.\r\n\r\nPlace the `compress` contents within a try-finally block.  \r\nThat way, you can close your streams in the event of an `IOException` occurring.  \r\nAnd, increase the scope of `nextByte`, by bringing its declaration outside of the `while` loop.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static void compress(InputStream is, OutputStream os) throws IOException {\r\n    try {\r\n        int currentByte = is.read();\r\n        int nextByte;\r\n        int count = 1;\r\n        while (currentByte != -1) {\r\n            nextByte = is.read();\r\n            if (nextByte == currentByte &amp;&amp; count &lt; 255)\r\n                count++;\r\n            else {\r\n                os.write((byte) count);\r\n                os.write((byte) currentByte);\r\n                count = 1;\r\n            }\r\n            currentByte = nextByte;\r\n        }\r\n    } finally {\r\n        os.flush();\r\n        is.close();\r\n        os.close();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for the `decompress` method, same situation, place the contents within a try-finally block.  \r\nYour `currentByte` assignment can be placed within the `while` condition statement.  \r\nAnd, you can utilize the `Arrays.fill` method to populate the `bytes` array.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static void decompress(InputStream is, OutputStream os) throws IOException {\r\n    try {\r\n        int currentByte;\r\n        int count, value;\r\n        byte[] bytes;\r\n        while ((currentByte = is.read()) != -1) {\r\n            count = currentByte &amp; 0xff;\r\n            value = is.read();\r\n            bytes = new byte[count];\r\n            Arrays.fill(bytes, (byte) value);\r\n            os.write(bytes);\r\n        }\r\n    } finally {\r\n        os.flush();\r\n        is.close();\r\n        os.close();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs an added measure, just to demonstrate what&#39;s happening when assigning a value greater than 127 to a `byte`.  \r\nConsider the following, we&#39;ll start at 125 and increment by 1, 4 times, to get to 129.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nbyte value;\r\nString binary;\r\nfor (int count = 1; count &lt; 5; count++) {\r\n    value = (byte) (125 + count);\r\n    System.out.printf(&quot;+%d, &quot;, count);\r\n    System.out.printf(&quot;value= %4d, &quot;, value);\r\n    binary = &quot;%8s&quot;.formatted(Integer.toBinaryString(value));\r\n    binary = binary.substring(binary.length() - 8);\r\n    System.out.printf(&quot;%s%n&quot;, binary);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```none\r\n+1, value=  126,  1111110\r\n+2, value=  127,  1111111\r\n+3, value= -128, 10000000\r\n+4, value= -127, 10000001\r\n```","title":"Problem with RLE program.

Is there any way for it to work even when the app is closed?\r\n\r\n\\`\r\n\r\n    // setting up the notification \r\n    // Set the desired date and time for the notification \r\n    \r\n    Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance(); \r\n    calendar.set(Calendar.YEAR, 2023); \r\n    calendar.set(Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.MAY); \r\n    calendar.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 20); \r\n    calendar.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 11); \r\n    calendar.set(Calendar.MINUTE, 1); \r\n    calendar.set(Calendar.SECOND, 0);\r\n    \r\n    // Create a new PendingIntent for the BroadcastReceiver\r\n    Intent intent = new Intent(this, AlarmReceiver.class);\r\n    PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(\r\n            this,\r\n            0,\r\n            intent,\r\n            PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE\r\n    );\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    // Get the AlarmManager and schedule the alarm\r\n    AlarmManager alarmManager = (AlarmManager) getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);\r\n    alarmManager.setExact(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, calendar.getTimeInMillis(), pendingIntent);`\r\n\r\n**AlarmReceiver.java**\r\n\r\n    public class AlarmReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver { \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        @Override \r\n        public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) { \r\n            // Handle the alarm trigger here, show the notification \r\n            showNotification(context); \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        private void showNotification(Context context) {\r\n            // Create the notification channel (if not already created)\r\n            if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= Build.VERSION_CODES.O) {\r\n                NotificationChannel channel = new NotificationChannel(\r\n                        &quot;channel_id&quot;,\r\n                        &quot;Channel Name&quot;,\r\n                        NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT\r\n                );\r\n                NotificationManager notificationManager = context.getSystemService(NotificationManager.class);\r\n                notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(channel);\r\n            }\r\n        \r\n            // Create the notification\r\n            NotificationCompat.Builder builder = new NotificationCompat.Builder(context, &quot;channel_id&quot;)\r\n                    .setContentTitle(&quot;Yoga App&quot;)\r\n                    .setContentText(&quot;Take a moment for yourself and unwind with a soothing yoga session in our app today&quot;)\r\n                    .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_launcher)\r\n                    .setAutoCancel(true);\r\n        \r\n            NotificationManagerCompat notificationManager = NotificationManagerCompat.from(context);\r\n            notificationManager.notify(0, builder.build());\r\n    }}`\r\n\r\nI tried this method but it only worked when the app is open.

To be honest, if you are a Java developer, I would recommend Quarkus or something for building a REST API, not FastAPI. FastAPI is a fantastic tool, absolutely great if you are already in the Python ecosystem. \r\n\r\nWhen it goes about multithreading; Java is &#39;real&#39; multithreading where as Python is very much not. Java threads will run concurrently; two tasks can and will be executed at the same time. In Python, within one Python process, this is (nearly) impossible. The reason for this is GIL (google it, there is ton&#39;s of stuff out there on how it works). The result is; even if you use &#39;real&#39; threads in Python, code is still not executed concurrently but rather serially, where the interpreter (big difference to Java) is jumping from one call stack to another constantly. \r\n\r\nAs to what you refer to as &#39;logical threads&#39;, I think you mean the asynchronous capability of Python.

To be honest, if you are a Java developer, I would recommend Quarkus or something for building a REST API, not FastAPI. FastAPI is a fantastic tool, absolutely great if you are already in the Python ecosystem.</p>\n<p>When it goes about multithreading; Java is 'real' multithreading where as Python is very much not. Java threads will run concurrently; two tasks can and will be executed at the same time. In Python, within one Python process, this is (nearly) impossible. The reason for this is GIL (google it, there is ton's of stuff out there on how it works). The result is; even if you use 'real' threads in Python, code is still not executed concurrently but rather serially, where the interpreter (big difference to Java) is jumping from one call stack to another constantly.</p>\n<p>As to what you refer to as 'logical threads', I think you mean the asynchronous capability of Python.

Inject the EntityManager instance into your class using the @PersistenceContext annotation:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@PersistenceContext\r\nprivate EntityManager entityManager;\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Use the createQuery() method of the EntityManager instance to create a query object. You can pass a JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) query string or a native SQL query string as a parameter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nQuery query = entityManager.createQuery(&quot;SELECT e FROM Employee e WHERE e.salary &gt; :salary&quot;);\r\nquery.setParameter(&quot;salary&quot;, 50000);\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. If you are using a native SQL query, you can use the createNativeQuery() method instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\nQuery query = entityManager.createNativeQuery(&quot;SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary &gt; :salary&quot;, Employee.class);\r\nquery.setParameter(&quot;salary&quot;, 50000);\r\n```\r\n\r\n4.

I'm using Hibernate 5 for compatibility with Java 8.</p>\n<pre><code>    import java.util.Properties;\n    \n    import org.hibernate.Session;\n    import org.hibernate.SessionFactory;\n    import org.hibernate.Transaction;\n    import org.hibernate.cfg.AnnotationConfiguration;\n    \n    import ua.gov.ioc.exchange.config.HibernateConfig;\n    import ua.gov.ioc.exchange.obituary.model.TestEntity;\n    \n    public class HibernateApp {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SessionFactory sessionFactory = buildSessionFactory();\n\n        Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();\n        Transaction transaction = session.beginTransaction();\n        \n        TestEntity entity = new TestEntity();\n        session.save(entity);\n\n        transaction.commit();\n        session.close();\n        sessionFactory.close();\n    }\n\n    private static SessionFactory buildSessionFactory() {\n        try {\n            AnnotationConfiguration configuration = new AnnotationConfiguration();\n            Properties properties = PropertiesReader.get();\n            configuration.setProperties(properties);\n            configuration.addAnnotatedClass(app.model.TestEntity.class);\n            configuration.buildMappings();\n            return configuration.buildSessionFactory();\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n            throw new ExceptionInInitializerError(e);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>My entity:</p>\n<pre><code>import javax.persistence.*;\nimport org.hibernate.annotations.BatchSize;\n\n@Entity\n@Table(name = &quot;TestEntity&quot;)\npublic class TestEntity {\n    @Id\n    private Long id = 1L;\n\n    public Long getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n\n    public void setId(Long id) {\n        this.id = id;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>My properties:</p>\n<pre><code>hibernate.connection.driver_class=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver\nhibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10gDialect\nhibernate.ddl-auto=update\nhibernate.connection.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@10.0.0.181:1521:center\nhibernate.connection.username=username\nhibernate.connection.password=password\nhibernate.connection.autocommit=true\n</code></pre>\n"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":9802,"page":423,"page_size":100}
