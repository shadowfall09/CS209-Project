For the sake of simple program reproduction, I put all my code into one `TextGui` class and every code block within this post just adds to that file.\r\n\r\n1. The `TestGui` `JFrame` and entry into the program, nothing peculiar about it.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class TestGui extends JFrame {\r\n    public static void main (String[] args) {\r\n        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(TestGui::new);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public TestGui() {\r\n        setDefaultCloseOperation(EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\r\n        setLocationRelativeTo(null);\r\n        add(new ListPanelTest());\r\n        pack();\r\n        setVisible(true);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The `JPanel` which is basically the container for all the expandable `JPanels`. Has the task to store the panels inside, so that the `MouseWheelListener` can move them all. The movement works fine until an entry is expanded, the view snaps back to the top, but should of course be the same as before.\r\nThere is also the problem of resizing. Resizing the window reveals a fatal flaw, the `JButtons` are not directly underneath each other but are rather separated by white spaces where `JPanels` *could* be revealed.\r\n```\r\nclass ListPanelTest extends JPanel {\r\n    String[] entryTexts = {&quot;dropdown1:content1&quot;, &quot;dropdown2:content2&quot;, &quot;dropdown3:content3&quot;};\r\n    ArrayList&lt;EntryListPanelTest&gt; entryPanels;\r\n\r\n    public ListPanelTest(){\r\n        setLayout(new BoxLayout(this, BoxLayout.Y_AXIS));\r\n        entryPanels = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n        for (String entryText: entryTexts) {\r\n            EntryListPanelTest entryListPanel = new EntryListPanelTest(entryText);\r\n            entryPanels.add(entryListPanel);\r\n            add(entryListPanel);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        addMouseWheelListener(e -&gt; {\r\n            for (EntryListPanelTest entryPanel : entryPanels) {\r\n                entryPanel.setLocation(entryPanel.getX(), entryPanel.getY() - e.getWheelRotation() * 20);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. The last class should be self-explanatory. A `JButton` reveals (and hides) a `JPanel`. The only interesting part is the `BorderLayout.NORTH` and `BorderLayout.CENTER`. They are important to convey the `LayoutManager` in which order and where to position both entries.\r\n```\r\nclass EntryListPanelTest extends JPanel {\r\n    public EntryListPanelTest(String entryText){\r\n        String[] entryTextSplit = entryText.split(&quot;:&quot;);\r\n        setLayout(new BorderLayout());\r\n        JButton button = new JButton(entryTextSplit[0]);\r\n        JLabel label = new JLabel(entryTextSplit[1]);\r\n        label.setVisible(false);\r\n\r\n        add(button, BorderLayout.NORTH);\r\n        add(label, BorderLayout.CENTER);\r\n\r\n        button.addActionListener(e -&gt; label.setVisible(!label.isVisible()));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe program is already pretty close to what I am trying to archive but the points elucidated in 2 are really important. How can I stop snapping to the top upon reveal of some content? How can I get rid of spacing between unrevealed `JButtons` if the size is not the `packed()` size? And is there maybe an even simpler way to this behavior (but still without an additional library)? \r\n\r\n[1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/frcec.png","title":"How can I create an expandable and scrollable list?","body":"<p>I'm trying to accomplish following:</p>\n<p>A <code>JPanel</code> (representing the container) including multiple <code>JPanels</code> which are including a <code>JButton</code> which - upon clicking - reveals another <code>JPanel</code> associated with the clicked <code>JButton</code>.

Child array is used for the children of the node if is is an OBJECT or ARRAY. The only thing that changes is what it is flagged as. Also keep all values as string type. That way you just need a single member on the node called &quot;value&quot; that can be interpreted as the correct data type after all the hard work is done.\r\n\r\n 6. Use defensive coding and unit tests. Write tests for all of the components of the parser. Better to spend an extra 3 hours writing code in a paranoid fashion where you assume you are making mistakes every second than to have to spend 3 hours hunting down bugs. Code paranoid enough, and you&#39;ll very rarely spend time being frustrated when debugging.\r\n\r\nExample Code:\r\nWhen I was doing an easy(ironically) challenge on code-eval.com.\r\nThere was a json menu parsing challenge. I thought it would be cheating\r\nto use any built-in functions, because to me the whole point of code challenges\r\nis to test your algorithm problem solving abilities.\r\nThe challenge is here: https://www.codeeval.com/open_challenges/102/\r\n\r\nMy Code, that passes this challenge, using a parser built from scratch in\r\njavascript:\r\n\r\n    CODE: https://pastebin.com/BReK9iij\r\n    Was not able to post it on stack-overflow because it is too much code.\r\n    Put it in a non-expiring paste-bin post.\r\n    \r\n\r\nNote: This code could use some improvement. Some of it is very inefficient\r\nand it won&#39;t work with Unicode. \r\n\r\n**I wouldn&#39;t recommend writing your own JSON parser unless you are interpreting the JSON in some type of non-standard way.**\r\n\r\nFor example: I currently am using JSONedit to organize branches for a text-based\r\nadventure. I am only using JSON file format because it is compact and the viewer allows me to expand and contract items.

Modern javacs, if targeting modern JVMs ('modern' defined here as: &quot;Has the nestmates feature available&quot;), will use nestmates and forego all the synthetics.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1056871,"reputation":117749,"user_id":1059372,"accept_rate":97,"display_name":"Eugene"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":198,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":74987239,"answer_count":3,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1672695527,"creation_date":1672694583,"question_id":74987182,"body_markdown":"Having a class like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Sample1 {\r\n\r\n    public class Inner {\r\n        private int f;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void go() {\r\n        Inner in = new Inner();\r\n        int value = in.f;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe byte-code for the `go` method (before java-11) calls that known synthetic method:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstatic int access$000(nestmates.Sample1$Inner);\r\n    descriptor: (Lnestmates/Sample1$Inner;)I\r\n    flags: ACC_STATIC, ACC_SYNTHETIC\r\n    Code:\r\n      stack=1, locals=1, args_size=1\r\n         0: aload_0\r\n         1: getfield      #1                  // Field f:I\r\n         4: ireturn\r\n```\r\n\r\nfrom:\r\n\r\n```\r\n0: new  #2  // class nestmates/Sample1$Inner\r\n3: dup\r\n4: aload_0\r\n5: invokespecial #3 // Method nestmates/Sample1$Inner.&quot;&lt;init&gt;&quot;:(Lnestmates/Sample1;)V\r\n8: astore_1\r\n9: aload_1\r\n10: invokestatic #4 // Method nestmates/Sample1$Inner.access$000:(Lnestmates/Sample1$Inner;)I\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve known about this for quite some time, but I&#39;ve never questioned myself _why_ this is like this?

By contrast, the word &quot;definition&quot; **does not appear** in either the table of contents or the index.\r\n\r\nSo, when you see someone use the word &quot;definition&quot; in the context of Java, they are either using it in the non-technical sense, or they are being sloppy with their terminology.  \r\n\r\nIn the latter case, they *might* mean the same thing as the technical term &quot;declaration&quot;, or they might mean something else.  And if they mean something else, you need to ask them what they mean.  If they have defined it ... fair enough, but it is not standard terminology.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThe answers that state that &quot;definition&quot; refers to the point at which the variable is initialized are specifically **not supported by the Java Language Specification**.  In Java, initialization of a variable either happens at the point of declaration, or in a later assignment.  In the latter case, no special term is used ... or needed ... apart from assignment and / or initialization.  There is no specified point at which storage is allocated for the variable.  Indeed, the chances are that the space for the variable itself is allocated **before** the declaration is reached.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThe reason that the &quot;definition&quot; term is not used in Java in the JLS spec is that it is not needed.  \r\n\r\n  - Since Java allows members to be declared in any order, there is no need for &quot;forward declarations&quot;.  That is the context where there it is necessary to distinguish between the two concepts.\r\n  - In Java the stack space required for a variable is a compile time constant, so the stack offset calculations happen at compile time.

By contrast, the word &quot;definition&quot; <strong>does not appear</strong> in either the table of contents or the index.</p>\n<p>So, when you see someone use the word &quot;definition&quot; in the context of Java, they are either using it in the non-technical sense, or they are being sloppy with their terminology.</p>\n<p>In the latter case, they <em>might</em> mean the same thing as the technical term &quot;declaration&quot;, or they might mean something else.  And if they mean something else, you need to ask them what they mean.  If they have defined it ... fair enough, but it is not standard terminology.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The answers that state that &quot;definition&quot; refers to the point at which the variable is initialized are specifically <strong>not supported by the Java Language Specification</strong>.  In Java, initialization of a variable either happens at the point of declaration, or in a later assignment.  In the latter case, no special term is used ... or needed ... apart from assignment and / or initialization.  There is no specified point at which storage is allocated for the variable.  Indeed, the chances are that the space for the variable itself is allocated <strong>before</strong> the declaration is reached.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The reason that the &quot;definition&quot; term is not used in Java in the JLS spec is that it is not needed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Since Java allows members to be declared in any order, there is no need for &quot;forward declarations&quot;.  That is the context where there it is necessary to distinguish between the two concepts.</li>\n<li>In Java the stack space required for a variable is a compile time constant, so the stack offset calculations happen at compile time.

Or if you do, you can return a constant value.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":18413382,"reputation":13,"user_id":13413009,"display_name":"Suma Deliveries"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":74986617,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1672690842,"creation_date":1672670864,"question_id":74983785,"body_markdown":"I have a recyclerview that displays a list of contacts.

In that case, I cannot set the system properties without destroying all calls to other services that would need another proxy.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I was able to find a way to set it by re-implementing some classes (see solution 2).\r\n\r\n**Important limitation:** the proxy server must not ask for credentials.\r\n\r\n0. Context\r\n\r\nMaybe as context before, I created a class containing proxy configuration: \r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Data\r\n@AllArgsConstructor\r\npublic class ProxyConfiguration {\r\n\r\n    public static final Pattern PROXY_PATTERN = Pattern.compile(&quot;(https?):\\\\/\\\\/(.*):(\\\\d+)&quot;);\r\n\r\n    private String scheme;\r\n    private String host;\r\n    private Integer port;\r\n\r\n    public static ProxyConfiguration fromPath(String path) {\r\n        Matcher matcher = PROXY_PATTERN.matcher(path);\r\n        if (matcher.find()) {\r\n            return new ProxyConfiguration(matcher.group(1), matcher.group(2), toInt(matcher.group(3)));\r\n        }\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getPath() {\r\n        return scheme + &quot;://&quot; + host + &quot;:&quot; + port;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Set system properties for proxy\r\n\r\nCall the following method with your proxy configuration at the start of the application or before using the Jira REST API:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static void configureProxy(ProxyConfiguration proxy) {\r\n    if (proxy != null) {\r\n        System.getProperties().setProperty(&quot;http.proxyHost&quot;, proxy.getHost());\r\n        System.getProperties().setProperty(&quot;http.proxyPort&quot;, proxy.getPort().toString());\r\n        System.getProperties().setProperty(&quot;https.proxyHost&quot;, proxy.getHost());\r\n        System.getProperties().setProperty(&quot;https.proxyPort&quot;, proxy.getPort().toString());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Re-implement `AsynchronousHttpClientFactory`\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as this class has many private inner classes and methods, you will have to do an ugly copy paste and change the following code to give the wanted proxy configuration:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic DisposableHttpClient createClient(URI serverUri, ProxyConfiguration proxy, AuthenticationHandler authenticationHandler) {\r\n    HttpClientOptions options = new HttpClientOptions();\r\n\r\n    if (proxy != null) {\r\n        options.setProxyOptions(new ProxyOptions.ProxyOptionsBuilder()\r\n            .withProxy(HTTP, new Host(proxy.getHost(), proxy.getPort()))\r\n            .withProxy(HTTPS, new Host(proxy.getHost(), proxy.getPort()))\r\n            .build());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    DefaultHttpClientFactory&lt;?&gt; defaultHttpClientFactory = ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can then use it (in the following example, my re-implementation of `AsynchronousHttpClientFactory` is called `AtlassianHttpClientFactory`):\r\n```java\r\nURI url = URI.create(JIRA_URL);\r\nString authentication = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(&quot;username:password&quot;.toBytes());\r\nDisposableHttpClient client = new AtlassianHttpClientFactory().createClient(url, proxy, new BasicAuthenticationHandler(authentication));\r\nreturn new AsynchronousJiraRestClient(url, client);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that after all those problems, I also decided to write a [Jira client library](https://github.com/Chavaillaz/jira-client) supporting authentication, proxy, multiple HTTP clients and working asynchronously with `CompletableFuture`.","title":"Jira REST API with proxy (Java)","body":"<p>The only solution I found on the internet was to set it with system parameters (see solution 1 below).
