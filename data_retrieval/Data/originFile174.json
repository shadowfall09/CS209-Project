This includes alternative JDK&#39;s from OpenJDK, Oracle, IBM, Azul, Amazon Correto, Graal and more.*\r\n\r\nYou have a few options for how to do the installation as well as manage JDK switching.  Installation can be done by Homebrew, [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io), [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/), or a manual install.  Switching can be done by [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io), [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/), or manually by setting `JAVA_HOME`.  All of these are described below. \r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language-all: lang-none --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr/&gt;\r\n\r\n# TL;DR - Preferred Methods of Installation\r\n\r\nYou can install Java using whatever method you prefer including SDKMAN, *asdf*, Homebrew, or a manual install of the tar.gz file.  The advantage of a manual install is that the location of the JDK can be placed in a standardized location for Mac OSX.  \r\n\r\nHowever, there are easier options such as *SDKMAN* and *asdf* that also will install other important and common tools for the JVM.  These two primary options are described here.\r\n\r\n## Installing and Switching versions with SDKMAN \r\n\r\n[**SDKMAN**](https://sdkman.io) is a bit different and handles both the install and the switching.  SDKMAN also places the installed JDK&#39;s into its own directory tree, which is typically `~/.sdkman/candidates/java`.  SDKMAN allows setting a global default version, and a version specific to the current shell.\r\n\r\n 1. Install SDKMAN from https://sdkman.io/install\r\n\r\n 2. List the Java versions available to make sure you know the version ID\r\n\r\n        sdk list java\r\n\r\n 3. Install one of those versions, for example, Java 21 LTS:\r\n\r\n        sdk install java 21-open \r\n\r\n    Or java 19:\r\n   \r\n        sdk install java 19.0.2-open\r\n\r\n 4. Make Java 17 the default version:\r\n\r\n        sdk default java 17-open\r\n\r\n    Or switch to 17 for the current terminal session:\r\n\r\n        sdk use java 17-open\r\n\r\nWhen you list available versions for installation using the list command, you will see a wide variety of distributions of Java:\r\n\r\n    sdk list java\r\n\r\nAnd install additional versions, such as JDK 11 from Amazon:\r\n\r\n    sdk install java 11.0.14.10.1-amzn\r\n    \r\nSDKMAN can work with previously installed existing versions.  Just do a local install giving your own version label and the location of the JDK:\r\n\r\n    sdk install java my-local-13 /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-13.jdk/Contents/Home\r\n\r\nAnd use it freely:\r\n\r\n    sdk use java my-local-13\r\n\r\nSDKMAN will automatically manage your `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME` for you as you change versions.  And as a note, it installs Java versions to `~/.sdkman/candidates/java/`.\r\n\r\nMore information is available in the [SDKMAN Usage Guide](https://sdkman.io/usage) along with [other SDK&#39;s](https://sdkman.io/sdks) it can install and manage such as Gradle, Maven, Kotlin, Quarkus, Spring Boot, and many others.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n\r\n## Installing and Switching versions with &quot;*asdf*&quot; \r\n\r\n[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) is a version manager that supports installing and managing most languages, frameworks, and developer/devops tools. It has language specific plugins including one [for Java](https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java).\r\n\r\n 1. First, install *asdf* via https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html (read there to setup your shell correctly), or more simply:\r\n\r\n        brew reinstall asdf\r\n\r\n    and [read the doc](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#_3-install-asdf) for setting up your shell correctly, but if you are using *asdf* from Homebrew with ZSH you can execute this command to finish setup:\r\n    \r\n        echo -e &quot;\\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/libexec/asdf.sh&quot; &gt;&gt; ${ZDOTDIR:-~}/.zshrc\r\n\r\n 2. Then install the Java plugin via https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java\r\n\r\n        asdf plugin add java\r\n\r\n    and [read the doc](https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java) for setting up your shell correctly before continuing.  Basically it says to add the following to your `~/.zshrc` file (assuming you are not using another shell):\r\n\r\n        . ~/.asdf/plugins/java/set-java-home.zsh\r\n\r\n 3. Now list Java versions: \r\n\r\n        asdf list-all java\r\n\r\n 4. Install your favorite flavor and version:  \r\n \r\n        asdf install java openjdk-21\r\n\r\n    or install the latest:\r\n\r\n        asdf install java latest\r\n\r\nOther important commands are...\r\n\r\n* List your installed versions:\r\n\r\n      asdf list java\r\n\r\n* Set a global Java version:\r\n\r\n      asdf global java openjdk-21\r\n\r\n* Set a local Java version for a directory:\r\n\r\n      asdf local java openjdk-19\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s that easy!  *asdf* will automatically manage your PATH and JAVA_HOME for you as you change versions.  As a note, *asdf* installs Java versions to `~/.asdf/installs/java`.\r\n\r\nThere are other languages and plugins for *asdf* here from the repository page: https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins\r\n\r\n&lt;hr/&gt;\r\n\r\n# Other Methods of Installation\r\n\r\n## Install with Homebrew\r\n\r\nThe version of Java available in Homebrew Cask previous to October 3, 2018 was indeed the Oracle JVM.  Now, however, it has now been updated to OpenJDK.  Be sure to update Homebrew and then you will see the lastest version available for install.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you haven&#39;t already.  Make sure it is updated:\r\n\r\n        brew update\r\n\r\n2. Add the casks tap:\r\n\r\n        brew tap homebrew/cask-versions\r\n\r\n    These casks change their Java versions often, and there might be other taps out there with additional Java versions.   \r\n    \r\n3. Look for installable versions:\r\n\r\n        brew search java  \r\n\r\n    or for Eclipse Temurin versions:\r\n\r\n        brew search temurin     \r\n\r\n4. Check the details on the version that will be installed:\r\n\r\n        brew info java\r\n\r\n    or for the Temurin version:\r\n\r\n        brew info temurin\r\n\r\n4. Install a specific version of the JDK such as `java11`, `temurin8`, `temurin11`, `temurin17`, or just `java` or `temurin` for the most current of that distribution.  For example:\r\n\r\n        brew install java\r\n\r\n        brew install --cask temurin\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd these will be installed into `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/` which is the traditional location expected on Mac OSX.  There might be additional steps to make the JDK active reported at the end of the install process.\r\n\r\n## Install manually from OpenJDK download page:\r\n\r\nIf you need any and every version of Java, this is a good place to look.\r\n\r\n 1. Download OpenJDK for Mac OSX from http://jdk.java.net/ (for example [Java 17](https://jdk.java.net/17/) and [Java 21](https://jdk.java.net/21/))\r\n\r\n 2. Unarchive the OpenJDK tar, and place the resulting folder (i.e. `jdk-19.jdk`) into your `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/` folder since this is the standard and expected location of JDK installs.  You can also install anywhere you want in reality.\r\n\r\n 3. Set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point at direction where you unarchived the JDK.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the answer [specific to manual installation](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53273225/3679676).

Zulu is 100% open source and freely downloadable. Now Java developers, system administrators, and end-users can enjoy the full benefits of open source Java with deployment flexibility and control over upgrade timing.\r\n\r\n[**Amazon Correto**](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/) OpenJDK builds have an easy to use an installation package for Java 8, 11, 17, and Java 21.  It installs to the standard `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/` directory on Mac OSX.\r\n\r\n&gt; Amazon Corretto is a no-cost, multiplatform, production-ready distribution of the Open Java Development Kit (OpenJDK). Corretto comes with long-term support that will include performance enhancements and security fixes. Amazon runs Corretto internally on thousands of production services and Corretto is certified as compatible with the Java SE standard. With Corretto, you can develop and run Java applications on popular operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.\r\n\r\n[**Microsoft Java JDK**](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk) - certified builds of OpenJDK from Microsoft.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr/&gt;\r\n\r\n# Where is my JDK?!?!\r\n\r\nTo find locations of previously installed Java JDK&#39;s installed at the default system locations, use:\r\n\r\n    /usr/libexec/java_home -V\r\n\r\n&gt; Matching Java Virtual Machines (4):&lt;br/&gt;\r\n&gt;    19 (x86_64) &quot;Homebrew&quot; - &quot;OpenJDK 19&quot; /usr/local/Cellar/openjdk/19/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home&lt;br/&gt;\r\n&gt;    18.0.1.1 (x86_64) &quot;Homebrew&quot; - &quot;OpenJDK 18.0.1.1&quot; /usr/local/Cellar/openjdk/18.0.1.1/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home&lt;br/&gt;\r\n&gt;    17 (x86_64) &quot;Homebrew&quot; - &quot;OpenJDK 17&quot; /usr/local/Cellar/openjdk/17/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home&lt;br/&gt;\r\n&gt;    11, x86_64:\t&quot;Java SE 11&quot;\t/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home&lt;br/&gt;\r\n&gt;    1.8.301.09 (x86_64) &quot;Oracle Corporation&quot; - &quot;Java&quot; /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home /usr/local/Cellar/openjdk/17/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\r\nYou can also report just the location of a specific Java version using `-v`.  For example for Java 17:\r\n\r\n    /usr/libexec/java_home -v 17\r\n\r\n&gt; /usr/local/Cellar/openjdk/17/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home\r\n\r\nKnowing the location of the installed JDK&#39;s is also useful when using tools like JEnv, or adding a local install manually to SDKMAN -- and you need to know where to find them.\r\n\r\nIf you need to find JDK&#39;s installed by other tools, check these locations:\r\n\r\n * SDKMAN installs to `~/.sdkman/candidates/java/`\r\n * *asdf* install to `~/.asdf/installs/java`\r\n\r\n&lt;hr/&gt;\r\n\r\n# Version Switching\r\n\r\nIf you are using *SDKMAN* or *asdf* you are already covered and can stop reading!  Otherwise, here are some options to switch existing VM installations.\r\n\r\n## Switching versions manually\r\n\r\nThe Java executable is a wrapper that will use whatever JDK is configured in `JAVA_HOME`, so you can change that to also change which JDK is in use.  \r\n\r\nFor example, if you installed or untar&#39;d JDK 16 to `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-16.jdk` if it is the highest version number it should already be the default, if not you could simply set:\r\n\r\n    export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-16.jdk/Contents/Home\r\n\r\nAnd now whatever Java executable is in the path will see this and use the correct JDK.\r\n\r\nA [simple way to change JDKs](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/homebrew-openjdk#switch-between-different-jdk-versions) is to create a function in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:\r\n\r\n    jdk() {\r\n        version=$1\r\n        export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v&quot;$version&quot;);\r\n        java -version\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd then change JDKs simply by:\r\n\r\n    jdk 1.8\r\n    jdk 9\r\n    jdk 11\r\n    jdk 13\r\n\r\n&lt;hr/&gt;\r\n\r\nEdits:\r\n* removed Jabba and JENV as both appear to have stagnated, issue count is climbing dramatically, and issues/PR&#39;s are not being addressed by the maintainers.","title":"How do I install Java on Mac OSX allowing version switching?","body":"<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>These solutions work for various versions of Java including Java 8 through Java 21 (the LTS version).  This includes alternative JDK's from OpenJDK, Oracle, IBM, Azul, Amazon Correto, Graal and more.</em></p>\n<p>You have a few options for how to do the installation as well as manage JDK switching.  Installation can be done by Homebrew, <a href=\"https://sdkman.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SDKMAN</a>, <a href=\"https://asdf-vm.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">asdf</a>, or a manual install.  Switching can be done by <a href=\"https://sdkman.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SDKMAN</a>, <a href=\"https://asdf-vm.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">asdf</a>, or manually by setting <code>JAVA_HOME</code>.  All of these are described below.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n<h1>TL;DR - Preferred Methods of Installation</h1>\n<p>You can install Java using whatever method you prefer including SDKMAN, <em>asdf</em>, Homebrew, or a manual install of the tar.gz file.  The advantage of a manual install is that the location of the JDK can be placed in a standardized location for Mac OSX.</p>\n<p>However, there are easier options such as <em>SDKMAN</em> and <em>asdf</em> that also will install other important and common tools for the JVM.  These two primary options are described here.</p>\n<h2>Installing and Switching versions with SDKMAN</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://sdkman.io\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>SDKMAN</strong></a> is a bit different and handles both the install and the switching.  SDKMAN also places the installed JDK's into its own directory tree, which is typically <code>~/.sdkman/candidates/java</code>.  SDKMAN allows setting a global default version, and a version specific to the current shell.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Install SDKMAN from <a href=\"https://sdkman.io/install\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://sdkman.io/install</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>List the Java versions available to make sure you know the version ID</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>sdk list java\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Install one of those versions, for example, Java 21 LTS:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>sdk install java 21-open \n</code></pre>\n<p>Or java 19:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>sdk install java 19.0.2-open\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Make Java 17 the default version:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>sdk default java 17-open\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or switch to 17 for the current terminal session:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>sdk use java 17-open\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When you list available versions for installation using the list command, you will see a wide variety of distributions of Java:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>sdk list java\n</code></pre>\n<p>And install additional versions, such as JDK 11 from Amazon:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>sdk install java 11.0.14.10.1-amzn\n</code></pre>\n<p>SDKMAN can work with previously installed existing versions.  Just do a local install giving your own version label and the location of the JDK:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>sdk install java my-local-13 /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-13.jdk/Contents/Home\n</code></pre>\n<p>And use it freely:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>sdk use java my-local-13\n</code></pre>\n<p>SDKMAN will automatically manage your <code>PATH</code> and <code>JAVA_HOME</code> for you as you change versions.  And as a note, it installs Java versions to <code>~/.sdkman/candidates/java/</code>.</p>\n<p>More information is available in the <a href=\"https://sdkman.io/usage\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SDKMAN Usage Guide</a> along with <a href=\"https://sdkman.io/sdks\" rel=\"noreferrer\">other SDK's</a> it can install and manage such as Gradle, Maven, Kotlin, Quarkus, Spring Boot, and many others.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Installing and Switching versions with &quot;<em>asdf</em>&quot;</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://asdf-vm.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">asdf</a> is a version manager that supports installing and managing most languages, frameworks, and developer/devops tools. It has language specific plugins including one <a href=\"https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java\" rel=\"noreferrer\">for Java</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>First, install <em>asdf</em> via <a href=\"https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html</a> (read there to setup your shell correctly), or more simply:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>brew reinstall asdf\n</code></pre>\n<p>and <a href=\"https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#_3-install-asdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">read the doc</a> for setting up your shell correctly, but if you are using <em>asdf</em> from Homebrew with ZSH you can execute this command to finish setup:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>echo -e &quot;\\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/libexec/asdf.sh&quot; &gt;&gt; ${ZDOTDIR:-~}/.zshrc\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Then install the Java plugin via <a href=\"https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java</a></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>asdf plugin add java\n</code></pre>\n<p>and <a href=\"https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java\" rel=\"noreferrer\">read the doc</a> for setting up your shell correctly before continuing.  Basically it says to add the following to your <code>~/.zshrc</code> file (assuming you are not using another shell):</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>. ~/.asdf/plugins/java/set-java-home.zsh\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Now list Java versions:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>asdf list-all java\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Install your favorite flavor and version:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>asdf install java openjdk-21\n</code></pre>\n<p>or install the latest:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>asdf install java latest\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Other important commands are...</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>List your installed versions:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>asdf list java\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Set a global Java version:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>asdf global java openjdk-21\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Set a local Java version for a directory:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>asdf local java openjdk-19\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's that easy!  <em>asdf</em> will automatically manage your PATH and JAVA_HOME for you as you change versions.  As a note, <em>asdf</em> installs Java versions to <code>~/.asdf/installs/java</code>.</p>\n<p>There are other languages and plugins for <em>asdf</em> here from the repository page: <a href=\"https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins</a></p>\n<hr/>\n<h1>Other Methods of Installation</h1>\n<h2>Install with Homebrew</h2>\n<p>The version of Java available in Homebrew Cask previous to October 3, 2018 was indeed the Oracle JVM.  Now, however, it has now been updated to OpenJDK.  Be sure to update Homebrew and then you will see the lastest version available for install.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://brew.sh/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">install Homebrew</a> if you haven't already.  Make sure it is updated:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code> brew update\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Add the casks tap:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code> brew tap homebrew/cask-versions\n</code></pre>\n<p>These casks change their Java versions often, and there might be other taps out there with additional Java versions.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Look for installable versions:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code> brew search java  \n</code></pre>\n<p>or for Eclipse Temurin versions:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code> brew search temurin     \n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Check the details on the version that will be installed:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code> brew info java\n</code></pre>\n<p>or for the Temurin version:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code> brew info temurin\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>Install a specific version of the JDK such as <code>java11</code>, <code>temurin8</code>, <code>temurin11</code>, <code>temurin17</code>, or just <code>java</code> or <code>temurin</code> for the most current of that distribution.  For example:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code> brew install java\n\n brew install --cask temurin\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And these will be installed into <code>/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/</code> which is the traditional location expected on Mac OSX.  There might be additional steps to make the JDK active reported at the end of the install process.</p>\n<h2>Install manually from OpenJDK download page:</h2>\n<p>If you need any and every version of Java, this is a good place to look.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Download OpenJDK for Mac OSX from <a href=\"http://jdk.java.net/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://jdk.java.net/</a> (for example <a href=\"https://jdk.java.net/17/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Java 17</a> and <a href=\"https://jdk.java.net/21/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Java 21</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Unarchive the OpenJDK tar, and place the resulting folder (i.e. <code>jdk-19.jdk</code>) into your <code>/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/</code> folder since this is the standard and expected location of JDK installs.  You can also install anywhere you want in reality.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Set <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable to point at direction where you unarchived the JDK.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For further information see the answer <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/53273225/3679676\">specific to manual installation</a>.

We can use the SerializedLambda approached described in [this stack overflow answer][1]. The gist of it is this: exploit the fact that any Serializable object that require an alternate form to be serialized MUST have a writeReplace method (as specified in [Serializable JavaDoc][2]), and we know for lambdas, the object returned by that method is [SerializedLambda][3]. From SerializedLambda, we know the lambda&#39;s implementer [class and method names][4]. From the class and method names, we can create a ClassVisitor to visit that class and read the bytecode corresponding to the lambda:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    private static SerializedLambda getSerializedLambda(Serializable lambda) throws Exception {\r\n        final Method method = lambda.getClass().getDeclaredMethod(&quot;writeReplace&quot;);\r\n        method.setAccessible(true);\r\n        return (SerializedLambda) method.invoke(lambda);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static List&lt;Object&gt; readBytecodeOf(Object lambdaObject) {\r\n        if (lambdaObject instanceof Serializable serializable) {\r\n            try {\r\n                SerializedLambda serializedLambda = getSerializedLambda(serializable);\r\n                ClassReader classReader = new ClassReader(serializedLambda.getImplClass());\r\n                LambdaClassVisitor lambdaClassVisitor =\r\n                        new LambdaClassVisitor(Opcodes.ASM9, serializedLambda.getImplMethodName());\r\n                classReader.accept(lambdaClassVisitor,\r\n                        ClassReader.SKIP_FRAMES | ClassReader.SKIP_DEBUG);\r\n                return lambdaClassVisitor.getBytecode();\r\n            } catch (Exception e) {\r\n                throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n            }\r\n        } else {\r\n            return List.of(new LambdaClassVisitor.UniqueObject(Float.NaN));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `LambdaClassVisitor` looks like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class LambdaClassVisitor extends ClassVisitor {\r\n    final String lambdaMethodName;\r\n    LambdaMethodVisitor methodVisitor;\r\n\r\n    protected LambdaClassVisitor(int api, String lambdaMethodName) {\r\n        super(api);\r\n        this.lambdaMethodName = lambdaMethodName;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public record UniqueObject(float number) {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public List&lt;Object&gt; getBytecode() {\r\n        if (methodVisitor.canBeCompared) {\r\n            return methodVisitor.getMethodBytecode();\r\n        } else {\r\n            return List.of(new UniqueObject(Float.NaN));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public MethodVisitor visitMethod(int modifiers, String name, String descriptor, String signature, String[] exceptions) {\r\n        if (lambdaMethodName.equals(name)) {\r\n            this.methodVisitor =\r\n                    new LambdaMethodVisitor(Modifier.isStatic(modifiers), api,\r\n                            super.visitMethod(modifiers, name, descriptor, signature, exceptions));\r\n            return this.methodVisitor;\r\n        }\r\n        return super.visitMethod(modifiers, name, descriptor, signature, exceptions);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand `LambdaMethodVisitor` looks like\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class LambdaMethodVisitor extends MethodVisitor {\r\n    final IdentityHashMap&lt;Label, Integer&gt; labelToId = new IdentityHashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n    final List&lt;Object&gt; methodBytecode = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    boolean canBeCompared = true;\r\n    boolean isStatic;\r\n\r\n    protected LambdaMethodVisitor(boolean isStatic, int api, MethodVisitor methodVisitor) {\r\n        super(api, methodVisitor);\r\n        this.isStatic = isStatic;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public List&lt;Object&gt; getMethodBytecode() {\r\n        return methodBytecode;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private record Instruction(int opcode) {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void visitInsn(final int opcode) {\r\n        super.visitInsn(opcode);\r\n        methodBytecode.add(new Instruction(opcode));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    record IntInstruction(int opcode, int operand) {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void visitIntInsn(final int opcode, final int operand) {\r\n        super.visitIntInsn(opcode, operand);\r\n        methodBytecode.add(new IntInstruction(opcode, operand));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void visitVarInsn(final int opcode, final int varIndex) {\r\n        super.visitVarInsn(opcode, varIndex);\r\n        if (!isStatic &amp;&amp; opcode == Opcodes.ALOAD &amp;&amp; varIndex == 0) {\r\n            canBeCompared = false;\r\n        }\r\n        methodBytecode.add(new IntInstruction(opcode, varIndex));\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // ... and so on for all visit... methods\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat being said, bytecode being equal does not imply the lambda themselves are equal. For instance, consider the following lambdas:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic Supplier&lt;Object&gt; getObjectSupplier(final Object item) {\r\n    return () -&gt; item;\r\n}\r\n\r\nSupplier&lt;Object&gt; a = getObjectSupplier(1);\r\nSupplier&lt;Object&gt; b = getObjectSupplier(2);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`a` and `b` will have the same bytecode, but they represent different functions. We want `equalLambdaCode(a,b) == false`, since they return different things. I attempt to detect this by marking all lambda whose bytecode either does `INVOKEDYNAMIC` (opcode used to create lambdas and other compiler specific things) or loads `this` as incomparable. Incomparable lambda gets `List.of(UniqueObject(Float.NaN))` as their bytecode, which can never be equal to any other list since `Float.NaN != Float.NaN`.\r\n\r\nWith all those functions defined, we can now define equalLambdaCode as:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static boolean equalLambdaCode(Object a, Object b)  {\r\n    List&lt;Object&gt; aBytecode = readBytecodeOf(a);\r\n    List&lt;Object&gt; bBytecode = readBytecodeOf(b);\r\n    return aBytecode.equals(bBytecode);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/35223119\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/invoke/SerializedLambda.html\r\n  [4]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/invoke/SerializedLambda.html#getImplClass--","title":"Check if two lambda&#39;s in Java execute the same code?","body":"<p>The answer depends on the functional interface the lambda implements.</p>\n<p>If the functional interface the lambda implements <strong>does not</strong> extend Serializable, the answer is no, as there is no reliable way to read the lambda bytecode that will work across different compilers and JVM's.</p>\n<p>If the functional interface the lambda implements <strong>does</strong> extend Serializable, the answer is yes.

From the class and method names, we can create a ClassVisitor to visit that class and read the bytecode corresponding to the lambda:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>    private static SerializedLambda getSerializedLambda(Serializable lambda) throws Exception {\n        final Method method = lambda.getClass().getDeclaredMethod(&quot;writeReplace&quot;);\n        method.setAccessible(true);\n        return (SerializedLambda) method.invoke(lambda);\n    }\n\n    private static List&lt;Object&gt; readBytecodeOf(Object lambdaObject) {\n        if (lambdaObject instanceof Serializable serializable) {\n            try {\n                SerializedLambda serializedLambda = getSerializedLambda(serializable);\n                ClassReader classReader = new ClassReader(serializedLambda.getImplClass());\n                LambdaClassVisitor lambdaClassVisitor =\n                        new LambdaClassVisitor(Opcodes.ASM9, serializedLambda.getImplMethodName());\n                classReader.accept(lambdaClassVisitor,\n                        ClassReader.SKIP_FRAMES | ClassReader.SKIP_DEBUG);\n                return lambdaClassVisitor.getBytecode();\n            } catch (Exception e) {\n                throw new RuntimeException(e);\n            }\n        } else {\n            return List.of(new LambdaClassVisitor.UniqueObject(Float.NaN));\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where <code>LambdaClassVisitor</code> looks like:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class LambdaClassVisitor extends ClassVisitor {\n    final String lambdaMethodName;\n    LambdaMethodVisitor methodVisitor;\n\n    protected LambdaClassVisitor(int api, String lambdaMethodName) {\n        super(api);\n        this.lambdaMethodName = lambdaMethodName;\n    }\n\n    public record UniqueObject(float number) {\n    }\n\n    public List&lt;Object&gt; getBytecode() {\n        if (methodVisitor.canBeCompared) {\n            return methodVisitor.getMethodBytecode();\n        } else {\n            return List.of(new UniqueObject(Float.NaN));\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public MethodVisitor visitMethod(int modifiers, String name, String descriptor, String signature, String[] exceptions) {\n        if (lambdaMethodName.equals(name)) {\n            this.methodVisitor =\n                    new LambdaMethodVisitor(Modifier.isStatic(modifiers), api,\n                            super.visitMethod(modifiers, name, descriptor, signature, exceptions));\n            return this.methodVisitor;\n        }\n        return super.visitMethod(modifiers, name, descriptor, signature, exceptions);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>and <code>LambdaMethodVisitor</code> looks like</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class LambdaMethodVisitor extends MethodVisitor {\n    final IdentityHashMap&lt;Label, Integer&gt; labelToId = new IdentityHashMap&lt;&gt;();\n    final List&lt;Object&gt; methodBytecode = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n    boolean canBeCompared = true;\n    boolean isStatic;\n\n    protected LambdaMethodVisitor(boolean isStatic, int api, MethodVisitor methodVisitor) {\n        super(api, methodVisitor);\n        this.isStatic = isStatic;\n    }\n\n    public List&lt;Object&gt; getMethodBytecode() {\n        return methodBytecode;\n    }\n\n    private record Instruction(int opcode) {\n    }\n\n    public void visitInsn(final int opcode) {\n        super.visitInsn(opcode);\n        methodBytecode.add(new Instruction(opcode));\n    }\n\n    record IntInstruction(int opcode, int operand) {\n    }\n\n    public void visitIntInsn(final int opcode, final int operand) {\n        super.visitIntInsn(opcode, operand);\n        methodBytecode.add(new IntInstruction(opcode, operand));\n    }\n\n    public void visitVarInsn(final int opcode, final int varIndex) {\n        super.visitVarInsn(opcode, varIndex);\n        if (!isStatic &amp;&amp; opcode == Opcodes.ALOAD &amp;&amp; varIndex == 0) {\n            canBeCompared = false;\n        }\n        methodBytecode.add(new IntInstruction(opcode, varIndex));\n    }\n    \n    // ... and so on for all visit... methods\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>That being said, bytecode being equal does not imply the lambda themselves are equal. For instance, consider the following lambdas:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public Supplier&lt;Object&gt; getObjectSupplier(final Object item) {\n    return () -&gt; item;\n}\n\nSupplier&lt;Object&gt; a = getObjectSupplier(1);\nSupplier&lt;Object&gt; b = getObjectSupplier(2);\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>a</code> and <code>b</code> will have the same bytecode, but they represent different functions. We want <code>equalLambdaCode(a,b) == false</code>, since they return different things. I attempt to detect this by marking all lambda whose bytecode either does <code>INVOKEDYNAMIC</code> (opcode used to create lambdas and other compiler specific things) or loads <code>this</code> as incomparable. Incomparable lambda gets <code>List.of(UniqueObject(Float.NaN))</code> as their bytecode, which can never be equal to any other list since <code>Float.NaN != Float.NaN</code>.</p>\n<p>With all those functions defined, we can now define equalLambdaCode as:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public static boolean equalLambdaCode(Object a, Object b)  {\n    List&lt;Object&gt; aBytecode = readBytecodeOf(a);\n    List&lt;Object&gt; bBytecode = readBytecodeOf(b);\n    return aBytecode.equals(bBytecode);\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":216698,"reputation":26495,"user_id":472109,"accept_rate":85,"display_name":"Geoffrey De Smet"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":350,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":77138816,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1695174340,"creation_date":1616611541,"question_id":66787415,"body_markdown":"How can I check if 2 lambda&#39;s run the same code?\r\nSuppose I have the following code:\r\n\r\n    \r\n    main() {\r\n        Predicate&lt;Person&gt; a = (person -&gt; person.getAge() &gt; 18);\r\n        Predicate&lt;Person&gt; b = (person -&gt; person.getAge() &gt; 18);\r\n        boolean x = equalLamdbaCode(a, b)); // should return true\r\n    \r\n        Predicate&lt;Person&gt; c = (person -&gt; person.getAge() &gt; 40);\r\n        boolean y = equalLamdbaCode(a, c)); // should return false\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIs there a reliable way to implement that `equalLamdbaCode(a, b)` method?","title":"Check if two lambda&#39;s in Java execute the same code?","body":"<p>How can I check if 2 lambda's run the same code?\nSuppose I have the following code:</p>\n<pre><code>main() {\n    Predicate&lt;Person&gt; a = (person -&gt; person.getAge() &gt; 18);\n    Predicate&lt;Person&gt; b = (person -&gt; person.getAge() &gt; 18);\n    boolean x = equalLamdbaCode(a, b)); // should return true\n\n    Predicate&lt;Person&gt; c = (person -&gt; person.getAge() &gt; 40);\n    boolean y = equalLamdbaCode(a, c)); // should return false\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is there a reliable way to implement that <code>equalLamdbaCode(a, b)</code> method?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","signature","covariant-return-types"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":6651855,"reputation":224830,"user_id":5133585,"accept_rate":96,"display_name":"Sweeper"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1695173448,"creation_date":1695173448,"answer_id":77138788,"question_id":77138230,"body_markdown":"I think you might have forgotten to *recompile* `A1`, after you changed `A`.\r\n\r\nThere is no return type covariance in the JVM.

Even if they wanted to, they don&#39;t run those projects at all. Separately, &#39;illegal&#39; refers to a country&#39;s criminal code. Whatever Oracle / team OpenJDK likes to say, &#39;illegal&#39; is not the appropriate term. It&#39;s an API access route that team OpenJDK does not officially support. There isn&#39;t any licensing violation here, so let&#39;s be careful with the choice of words. In the mean time, Lombok runs on Java&amp;nbsp;6 through 21; few libraries get to claim that kind of reach.\r\n\r\nWe can always just fork *javac*. It&#39;s open source. We know just how to do that and would do so if it comes down to that. However, the experience for you as a user would be annoyance. It would also play havoc with the idea that *javac* isn&#39;t _just_ a tool you invoke yourself; often other tools invoke it, and tend not to let you configure where *javac* lives easily, which makes a fork harder to use. However, in practice, we can enumerate the tools you are likely to run into, especially because *javac*, while open source, isn&#39;t very permissively licensed, and any attempt to use *javac* as part of a larger tool suffers from the same belligerent lockdown treatment that *javac* (as an API) exudes: Trying to deeply entwine with it isn&#39;t supported, so all you can really do is just call it like a command line tool, really.\r\n\r\nWhich makes writing plugins for those tools very simple. We just have to add some `--add-opens` lines and otherwise run with verbatim `javac`, or just mix Lombok into its modules and ship that.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we can name 99% of all interactions with *javac*:\r\n\r\n* [Maven][3]\r\n* [Gradle][4]\r\n* Your IDE (but we already need, and have, plugins for those)\r\n* *javac* itself, but rarely.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s, basically, it. The majority of linter tools and other [AST][5]-based analysers actually use *ecj* (Eclipse&#39;s compiler) under the hood, not *javac*. For example, Visual Studio Code uses Eclipse as a language server. Possibly because *ecj* is significantly faster. Probably because its more permissively licensed ([MIT-style][6] instead of [GPL][7] style).\r\n\r\nTherefore, all Lombok really needs to do if team OpenJDK closes every hole we use right now, is to write plugins for Gradle and Maven. Which isn&#39;t a problem: Both of those tools are fundamentally plugin based already, and writing these plugins would be a one-week job.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: As of September 12th, 2023, the maven plugin idea exists and works as designed. It took a day, not a week. We&#39;ll make it part of the official way to use lombok in maven in due time.\r\n\r\nOnce such plugins exists, OpenJDK hasn&#39;t expressed any interest in closing that route down. If they change their mind and try to, they&#39;d have to _change the licensing first_, which I don&#39;t think is likely to happen, but you&#39;ll have to decide that for yourself. Of course, if OpenJDK changes its licensing, then [A] its name would then be a joke, and [B] that would have a very significant impact on the ecosystem indeed, Lombok needing to sort out its licensing probably shouldn&#39;t rate as anywhere near the top concern if that drastic step ever happens, and [C] surely the community would __immediately__ fork the last open source version, find a new name (Oracle owns the &#39;Java&#39; and &#39;OpenJDK&#39; trademarks), and the community is somewhat likely to go with that project and leave Oracle/OpenJDK behind entirely at that point. You may rate it differently, but I&#39;d say it&#39;s fairly obvious that&#39;s not a contingency that&#39;s realistic at this point in time.\r\n\r\n## That article about delombok\r\n\r\nI feel attacked. Boy, it&#39;s a horribly written article. The first point they make, which comprises half of the article, is talking about an exotic bug (namely, that `@ToString` on an enum, which is weird because enums already have a workable *tostring*, does the wrong thing. Yes, that was a bug) and somehow translating that to some sort of &#39;see? It&#39;s weird and bad&#39;. I don&#39;t know about you, but if I approach programming on the basis of: If I run into __a single bug__ for a dependency I have, I shall __immediately__ ditch that dependency and write a nastygram blogpost about it. I would be soldering my own computer together at this point.\r\n\r\n&gt; However, the generated files were extremely ugly and not following any styling\r\n\r\nHogwash. We try to copy your tabbing and follow standard coding conventions (more or less, the Google style). We also take pains not to modify anything we don&#39;t have to.\r\n\r\n&gt; That were converted to many lines using if/throw blocks instead of one-line solutions like Guava Preconditions or Validate from Apache Commons.\r\n\r\nYou can tell Lombok to generate such things; the author didn&#39;t read the documentation of the tools they used before deciding to write that blogpost, I guess. We don&#39;t default to requiring still more dependencies for no good reason, of course. It&#39;s also not &#39;many lines&#39; at all, and it&#39;s extremely structured, so it is very easy to script away if you really don&#39;t want them for some reason (but, you added the `@NonNull` annotations, which do nothing except add those checks, so that&#39;s a weird thing to want to do).\r\n\r\n&gt; (right now Lombok is still facing problems with Java 9-11)\r\n\r\nLies. At least, I&#39;m not aware of any bugs, and the author doesn&#39;t say what they are talking about. Given that they prove they haven&#39;t bothered to read any documentation or try any settings, it&#39;s likely this is another pilot error situation. It was written a few years ago; Lombok runs fine on 9 and 11. (Lombok support for Java 9 took a few weeks after the official release of Java 9. This happens from time to time; however, not sure where &#39;Java 11&#39; is coming from here).\r\n\r\n_Generally_, delombok should be fine. There where Lombok generates __a lot__ of boilerplate for you (primarily, `@Builder`), the generated code probably isn&#39;t quite what you would have written (as in, it&#39;s a lot), and might be more to maintain than you signed up for. However, aside from `@Builder`, the rest is straightforward. Lombok intentionally doesn&#39;t like straying into errors that go beyond its mission to replace boilerplate, and that is defined as:\r\n\r\n1. It is common\r\n2. There is a universally agreed upon&amp;mdash;or at least fairly standard&amp;mdash;way to write it\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, by that very definition then, what delombok spits out is probably exactly how you would write it if Lombok wasn&#39;t around. Builder walks the line the most, but then, it takes care of a _ton_ of boilerplate so we&#39;re definitely keeping `@Builder` around.\r\n\r\nDelomboked code might not quite follow your exact style guidelines. It is quite configurable, but &#39;preferred style&#39; is a _very_ broad topic. You can (and probably should!) toss your delomboked code through an auto-formatter. That&#39;s not an option if you don&#39;t normally autoformat your source files and like the freedom of styling it the way you want, but, any additions to delombok&#39;s configurations to support more styles would be the kind of PR we would readily accept.\r\n\r\n## How would using another annotation processor cause Lombok to fail?\r\n\r\nThere can be a chicken and egg problem: Annotation processors A runs (not Lombok) and locks in certain decisions based on the source structure they see. _Then_ Lombok runs and adds some stuff, but A&#39;s already moved on. We use the rounds system of annotation processors (All APs, not just Lombok, suffer from this, it&#39;s why there&#39;s a rounds system), but Lombok modifies things that the base *Annotation Processor* specifications say don&#39;t normally change between rounds, so not all APs interact properly. It&#39;s hard to tell *javac* in which order to run them (generally, running Lombok first solves all problems). Whenever this occurs, we try to communicate with the relevant project to ensure we fix any problems, and few APs generate code based on code structure (most generate based on annotations!) One project where this comes up, is MapStruct. We try to work with them to make sure things work out regardless of which one of us &#39;runs first&#39;.\r\n\r\nIf you use another AP that uses source structure as an input, you might run into some trouble, yes. For what it&#39;s worth, writing plugins for your build system would likely just solve that entirely (we can force Lombok to run first if we do that).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_%28software%29\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven\r\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradle\r\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree\r\n  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License\r\n  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License\r\n","title":"About project Lombok&#39;s future","body":"<p>Lombok author here.</p>\n<h2>Would Lombok ever stop working?</h2>\n<p>Not likely.</p>\n<p>We are a plugin in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">IntelliJ IDEA</a> and more or less a plugin in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_%28software%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eclipse</a>; these routes cannot be closed down and aren't being targeted by Oracle/OpenJDK.

This class, an ordered list class, uses a sequence of generic nodes to have a list in ascending order.

This method takes another ordered list object as a parameter and uses this ordered list in the method too. The addFrom method will identify the correct position and place the node in the correct position. However, I want to have the method traverse through the nodes of both lists exactly once.

So you need a workaround for waiting for this phase. There are different possible solutions to this:\r\n\r\n## 1. Listen to Draw/Layout Events: ViewTreeObserver\r\n\r\nA ViewTreeObserver gets fired for different drawing events. Usually the [`OnGlobalLayoutListener`][1] is what you want for getting the measurement, so the code in the listener will be called after the layout phase, so the measurements are ready:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nview.getViewTreeObserver().addOnGlobalLayoutListener(new ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener() {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onGlobalLayout() {\r\n        view.getViewTreeObserver().removeOnGlobalLayoutListener(this);\r\n        view.getHeight(); //height is ready\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Note*: The listener will be immediately removed because otherwise it will fire on every layout event. If you have to support apps *SDK Level &lt; 16* use this to unregister the listener:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic void removeGlobalOnLayoutListener (ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener victim)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2. Add a runnable to the layout queue: View.post()\r\n\r\nNot very well known and my favourite solution. Basically just use the View&#39;s post method with your own runnable. This basically queues your code *after* the view&#39;s measure, layout, etc. as stated by [Romain Guy][2]:\r\n\r\n&gt; The UI event queue will process events in order. After\r\n&gt; setContentView() is invoked, the event queue will contain a message\r\n&gt; asking for a relayout, so anything you post to the queue will happen\r\n&gt; after the layout pass\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfinal View view=...;\r\n...\r\nview.post(new Runnable() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void run() {\r\n                view.getHeight(); //height is ready\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe advantage over `ViewTreeObserver`:\r\n\r\n- your code is only executed once, and you don&#39;t have to disable the Observer after execution which can be a hassle\r\n- less verbose syntax\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/a/3602144/774398\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/a/3948036/774398\r\n\r\n&lt;br /&gt;  \r\n\r\n## 3. Overwrite Views&#39;s onLayout Method\r\n\r\nThis is only practical in certain situation when the logic can be encapsulated in the view itself, otherwise this is a quite verbose and cumbersome syntax.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nview = new View(this) {\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void onLayout(boolean changed, int l, int t, int r, int b) {\r\n        super.onLayout(changed, l, t, r, b);\r\n        view.getHeight(); //height is ready\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso mind, that onLayout will be called many times, so be considerate what you do in the method, or disable your code after the first time\r\n\r\n## 4. Check if has been through layout phase\r\n\r\nIf you have code that is executing multiple times while creating the UI you could use the following support v4 lib method:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nView viewYouNeedHeightFrom = ...\r\n...\r\nif(ViewCompat.isLaidOut(viewYouNeedHeightFrom)) {\r\n   viewYouNeedHeightFrom.getHeight();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt; Returns true if view has been through at least one layout since it was\r\n&gt; last attached to or detached from a window.\r\n\r\n## Additional: Getting statically defined measurements\r\n\r\nIf it suffices to just get the statically defined height/width, you can just do this with:\r\n\r\n- [`View.getMeasuredWidth()`][3]\r\n- [`View.getMeasuredHeigth()`][4]\r\n\r\nBut mind you, that this might be different to the actual width/height after drawing. The Javadoc describes the difference in more detail:\r\n\r\n&gt; The size of a view is expressed with a width and a height. A view\r\n&gt; actually possess two pairs of width and height values.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; The first pair is known as measured width and measured height. These\r\n&gt; dimensions define how big a view wants to be within its parent (see\r\n&gt; Layout for more details.) The measured dimensions can be obtained by\r\n&gt; calling getMeasuredWidth() and getMeasuredHeight().\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; The second pair is simply known as width and height, or sometimes\r\n&gt; drawing width and drawing height. These dimensions define the actual\r\n&gt; size of the view on screen, at drawing time and after layout. These\r\n&gt; values may, but do not have to, be different from the measured width\r\n&gt; and height. The width and height can be obtained by calling getWidth()\r\n&gt; and getHeight().\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener.html\r\n[2]: https://stackoverflow.com/users/298575/romain-guy\r\n[3]: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#getMeasuredWidth()\r\n[4]: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#getMeasuredHeight()","title":"View&#39;s getWidth() and getHeight() returns 0","body":"<p>The basic problem is, that you have to wait for the drawing phase for the actual measurements (especially with dynamic values like <code>wrap_content</code> or <code>match_parent</code>), but usually this phase hasn't been finished up to <code>onResume()</code>.

After\nsetContentView() is invoked, the event queue will contain a message\nasking for a relayout, so anything you post to the queue will happen\nafter the layout pass</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>final View view=...;\n...\nview.post(new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                view.getHeight(); //height is ready\n            }\n        });\n</code></pre>\n<p>The advantage over <code>ViewTreeObserver</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your code is only executed once, and you don't have to disable the Observer after execution which can be a hassle</li>\n<li>less verbose syntax</li>\n</ul>\n<p>References:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/3602144/774398\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/3602144/774398</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/3948036/774398\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/3948036/774398</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br />  \n<h2>3. Overwrite Views's onLayout Method</h2>\n<p>This is only practical in certain situation when the logic can be encapsulated in the view itself, otherwise this is a quite verbose and cumbersome syntax.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>view = new View(this) {\n    @Override\n    protected void onLayout(boolean changed, int l, int t, int r, int b) {\n        super.onLayout(changed, l, t, r, b);\n        view.getHeight(); //height is ready\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also mind, that onLayout will be called many times, so be considerate what you do in the method, or disable your code after the first time</p>\n<h2>4. Check if has been through layout phase</h2>\n<p>If you have code that is executing multiple times while creating the UI you could use the following support v4 lib method:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>View viewYouNeedHeightFrom = ...\n...\nif(ViewCompat.isLaidOut(viewYouNeedHeightFrom)) {\n   viewYouNeedHeightFrom.getHeight();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Returns true if view has been through at least one layout since it was\nlast attached to or detached from a window.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Additional: Getting statically defined measurements</h2>\n<p>If it suffices to just get the statically defined height/width, you can just do this with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#getMeasuredWidth()\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>View.getMeasuredWidth()</code></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#getMeasuredHeight()\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>View.getMeasuredHeigth()</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>But mind you, that this might be different to the actual width/height after drawing. The Javadoc describes the difference in more detail:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The size of a view is expressed with a width and a height. A view\nactually possess two pairs of width and height values.</p>\n<p>The first pair is known as measured width and measured height. These\ndimensions define how big a view wants to be within its parent (see\nLayout for more details.) The measured dimensions can be obtained by\ncalling getMeasuredWidth() and getMeasuredHeight().</p>\n<p>The second pair is simply known as width and height, or sometimes\ndrawing width and drawing height. These dimensions define the actual\nsize of the view on screen, at drawing time and after layout. These\nvalues may, but do not have to, be different from the measured width\nand height. The width and height can be obtained by calling getWidth()\nand getHeight().</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2023117,"reputation":8402,"user_id":1808829,"accept_rate":80,"display_name":"Ayaz Alifov"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":35,"is_accepted":false,"score":35,"last_activity_date":1669030034,"creation_date":1490183537,"answer_id":42950862,"question_id":3591784,"body_markdown":"I would rather use [OnPreDrawListener()][1] instead of [addOnGlobalLayoutListener()][2], since it is called a bit earlier than other listeners. \r\n\r\n\r\n        view.getViewTreeObserver().addOnPreDrawListener(new ViewTreeObserver.OnPreDrawListener()\r\n        {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public boolean onPreDraw()\r\n            {\r\n                if (view.getViewTreeObserver().isAlive())\r\n                    view.getViewTreeObserver().removeOnPreDrawListener(this);\r\n                \r\n                // put your code here\r\n                return true;\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewTreeObserver.OnPreDrawListener\r\n  [2]: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewTreeObserver#addOnGlobalLayoutListener(android.view.ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener)\r\n\r\nAdjusted the code according to comment of @Pang. onPreDraw method should return true to proceed with the current drawing pass.","title":"View&#39;s getWidth() and getHeight() returns 0","body":"<p>I would rather use <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewTreeObserver.OnPreDrawListener\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OnPreDrawListener()</a> instead of <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewTreeObserver#addOnGlobalLayoutListener(android.view.ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">addOnGlobalLayoutListener()</a>, since it is called a bit earlier than other listeners.</p>\n<pre><code>    view.getViewTreeObserver().addOnPreDrawListener(new ViewTreeObserver.OnPreDrawListener()\n    {\n        @Override\n        public boolean onPreDraw()\n        {\n            if (view.getViewTreeObserver().isAlive())\n                view.getViewTreeObserver().removeOnPreDrawListener(this);\n            \n            // put your code here\n            return true;\n        }\n    });\n</code></pre>\n<p>Adjusted the code according to comment of @Pang. onPreDraw method should return true to proceed with the current drawing pass.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":88834,"reputation":8981,"user_id":245495,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"Odys"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":false,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1514659122,"creation_date":1514659122,"answer_id":48036820,"question_id":3591784,"body_markdown":"One liner if you are using [RxJava][1] &amp; [RxBindings][2].

Whenever I click a 0 on the grid, it takes too long for my program to click each adjacent button. I tried using a stack and a queue and they are both just about as slow. My Main class deals with the bomb logic and my GUIArray class deals with creating the GUI and in the findZero method of the GUIArray class is where the recursion takes place (the doClick() method is the recursive call).

Is there any way I could do this quicker?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com\">Minesweeper GUI Link</a>\nThis link shows the problem. Whenever I click a 0 on the grid, it takes too long for my program to click each adjacent button. I tried using a stack and a queue and they are both just about as slow. My Main class deals with the bomb logic and my GUIArray class deals with creating the GUI and in the findZero method of the GUIArray class is where the recursion takes place (the doClick() method is the recursive call).

I would have *one* grid. Each cell in the grid would have either an `*` for a mine, or a digit from `0` to `8` for a non-mine. The work of placing mines and counting mines in neighboring cells would operate on that grid.\r\n\r\nFirst, I&#39;d break the job into more methods, each method being smaller.\r\n\r\n    public class MineSweeper {    \r\n       final static char ASTER = &#39;*&#39;;\r\n    \r\n       public static char [][] createMineField\r\n                      (int numRows, int numColumns, int numMines) {\r\n\r\n          char [][] field = new char [numRows][numColumns];\r\n          placeMines (field, numMines);\r\n          setCounts (field);        \r\n          return field;\r\n     }\r\n\r\nThe method `placeMines` places the mines in an empty grid. `setCounts` sets the elements of the non-mine cells to indicate how many adjacent (orthogonal and diagonal) cells contain a mine.\r\n\r\nSuppose we use this method for placing a mine:\r\n\r\n 1. Pick a row at random.  Pick a column at random. \r\n 2. Check to see if there is collision. A collision occurs if there is already a mine at the row and column from step 1.\r\n 3. If there is a collision, go back to step 1.\r\n 4. Place the mine at the location.\r\n 5. Increment the count of mines placed.\r\n 6. If at least one more mine is needed, go to step 1.\r\n 7. Otherwise, we are finished with mine placement.\r\n\r\nSuppose `t` is the total number of cells. That is `t = number of rows multiplied by number of columns`.  Suppose `m` is the number of mines to be placed. When `t` is high, and the ratio `m : t` is high, this method has a potential problem:  As more mines are placed, the more collisions there will be. This can slow the program. The following code always generates `t` random numbers, but avoids the collision problem. It seems wasteful if `t` is small, or the `m : t` ratio is low. But, it is guaranteed to avoid collisions:\r\n\r\n                \r\n    public static void placeMines (char [][] grid, int numMines) {\r\n        int size = grid.length * grid [0].length;\r\n        int [] order = new int [size];\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {\r\n            order [i] = i;\r\n        }\r\n        shuffle (order);\r\n        \r\n        int r, c;\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numMines; i++) {\r\n            r = order [i] / grid[0].length;\r\n            c = order [i] % grid[0].length;\r\n            grid [r][c] = ASTER;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    public static void shuffle (int [] arr) {\r\n        Random rand = new Random ();\r\n        int i, j, temp;\r\n        for (i = arr.length - 1; i &gt; 0; i--) {\r\n            j = rand.nextInt (i + 1);\r\n            temp = arr [j];\r\n            arr [j] = arr [i];\r\n            arr [i] = temp;\r\n        }              \r\n    }\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis generates the sequence `0` to `t - 1` in an array, then shuffles the sequence. The first `m` elements of shuffled array are taken to position `m` mines.\r\n\r\nHere is the code to fill in the rest of the grid:\r\n\r\n         \r\n    public static void setCounts(char[][] grid) {\r\n        int row, col, r, c, count;\r\n\r\n        for (row = 0; row &lt; grid.length; row++) {\r\n            for (col = 0; col &lt; grid[row].length; col++) {\r\n                if (grid [row][col] == ASTER) { \r\n                    continue;\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                count = 0;\r\n                for (r = row - 1; r &lt;= row + 1; r++) {\r\n                    for (c = col - 1; c &lt;= col + 1; c++) {\r\n                        if (    r &gt;= 0           &amp;&amp; c &gt;= 0\r\n                             &amp;&amp; r &lt;  grid.length &amp;&amp; c &lt; grid[row].length\r\n                             &amp;&amp; grid[r][c] == ASTER    ) {\r\n                            count++;\r\n                        }                            \r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n                grid [row][col] = (char) (&#39;0&#39; + count);                \r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe O/P commented that he / she has not yet had a lesson with the `char`  variable type. A `char` is a 16 bit Integer type, and is one of the primitive types. But, Java assumes these values represent 16 bit Unicode characters.  \r\n\r\nThe line `grid [row][col] = (char) (&#39;0&#39; + count);` converts the `count` value, which contains a value from 0 to 8, to the corresponding Unicode decimal digit.  This is similar to what can be done with ASCII in C, C++, and other characters. \r\n\r\nIf the O/P is not comfortable with using `char`, I suggest an `int` or `short` array instead. A mine might be represented with a &quot;special&quot; value outside that range, such as `-1`, `9`, or `10`.  \r\n\r\n         public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n           System.out.println(&quot;Starting program with &quot; + args.length + &quot; args: &quot;\r\n            + Arrays.toString(args) + &quot;\\n&quot;);  \r\n           char [][] game =  createMineField (15,30, 100);\r\n           for (int k = 0; k &lt; game.length; k++ ) { \r\n               System.out.println (Arrays.toString (game[k]));\r\n           }                \r\n         }    \r\n     }\r\n\r\nI hard coded a single test case. An array might be used to code multiple test cases. \r\n\r\nIn keeping with the original code, the O/P might need to parse `args` from `main` to get the values to use for a single test case each run, as in the O/P code. I also used a method from `java.util.Arrays` to quickly code output. The O/P will want to provide his / her own code to meet the requirements of the autochecker. \r\n\r\nSample output, with 15 rows, 30 columns, and 175 mines:\r\n\r\n````\r\n[3, *, *, 3, 1, 1, *, 3, *, 4, *, 3, 3, *, 4, *, *, 2, 3, *, 5, *, 4, 3, *, *, *, 3, *, 2]\r\n[*, *, *, *, 3, 3, 3, 5, *, 4, *, 4, *, *, 6, *, 5, 3, *, *, *, *, *, *, 4, 4, 3, 4, *, 2]\r\n[4, *, *, *, *, 3, *, *, 2, 3, 2, 5, *, 5, *, *, *, 4, 5, *, 7, 6, 6, 5, *, 2, 2, *, 2, 1]\r\n[*, 6, *, 7, *, 4, 2, 3, 2, 2, *, 5, *, 4, 2, 4, *, *, 3, *, *, *, *, *, 4, *, 4, 3, 2, 0]\r\n[3, *, *, 6, *, 4, 1, 3, *, 3, 2, *, *, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, *, *, 4, 3, *, 5, *, *, 3, 1]\r\n[*, 4, 4, *, *, 5, *, 5, *, 3, 2, 2, 4, *, 3, 2, *, 1, 0, 2, 4, 4, 3, 3, 4, *, *, *, *, 2]\r\n[2, 3, *, 5, *, 7, *, *, 5, *, 2, 1, 2, *, *, 4, 3, 3, 1, 2, *, *, 3, *, *, 4, 5, *, *, 2]\r\n[*, 4, 2, 3, *, *, *, *, *, 4, *, 1, 1, 3, 4, *, *, 5, *, 5, 5, 6, *, 4, 2, 2, *, 5, 4, 2]\r\n[*, *, 3, 3, 3, 4, *, 4, 3, *, 4, 3, 2, 3, *, 5, *, *, *, *, *, *, *, 2, 0, 1, 3, *, *, 1]\r\n[2, 3, *, *, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, *, *, 2, *, *, 3, 3, 5, 6, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, *, 4, 2]\r\n[0, 1, 3, *, *, 1, 1, *, *, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, *, *, *, 3, *, 2, 2, *, 3, *, 4, 3, *]\r\n[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 4, *, 4, 2, 2, *, 2, *, *, *, 5, 3, *, 3, 3, *, 3, 4, *, 4, *, 4]\r\n[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, *, 4, 3, 4, *, *, *, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, *, 4, 3, 4, *, 3, 3, *, 2, 1, 4, *, *]\r\n[0, 1, *, 3, *, *, *, *, *, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, *, 1, 2, *, 5, *, *, 6, *, 4, 2, 2, 0, 2, *, 3]\r\n[0, 1, 1, 3, *, 4, 3, 3, 3, *, 2, *, *, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, *, *, *, *, *, 3, *, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\r\n````\r\n\r\nI made all the methods static. Another approach would be to make the mine field an instance variable. The method `createMineField` could be replaced by a constructor.

Consider throwing and catching  <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> for these.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":5088711,"reputation":15,"user_id":4082419,"accept_rate":0,"display_name":"Brandon"},"comment_count":14,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":158,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1695146748,"creation_date":1694880584,"question_id":77118571,"body_markdown":"I&#39;ve gotten up to Test 9/10 of the autochecker and have made my programming now 333 lines of Java code, as per the course requirement (being written in Java, not over XXX amount of lines).

because I figured &quot;Why not?&quot;  I&#39;m very stumped right now.  I come from a C++ hobbyist approach.  I&#39;ve seen other answers that use a table of m+2/n+2 values which, as a wannabe solo game dev, I would consider a VERY bad practice of doing.  My personal belief is that you should only code what needs to be shown as it needs to be shown.  So, no extra table elements.  If that was done in C++ and compiled under the g++ compiler I would have to believe that, if uninitialized, those extra elements would default to garbage or NULL values and the program would SEGFAULT or interrupt.  I am probably wrong, but I need help fixing my apparent wrong approach to the problem.  Any help is GREATLY appreciated.  I would like to NOT need to simplify this if it can be helped.  I&#39;ve been on this one single problem for almost two weeks and have worked about three/four hours a night for 5 nights a week on this.  Thank you!\r\n\r\nI cannot think of anything else besides simplifying the code, but that is not my intention.\r\n\r\nEDIT 1: We cannot use any other random function besides a uniform distribution between 0 and n - 1 (0 being cell 1 and n being amount of cells) with Math.random(). I have seen answers by using a &quot;grid&quot; (int[][]) with two extra elements.  As a wannabe game dev, I would not accept extra elements as an answer. Try doing that in C++ while not initializing all values to 0 first.  I guess I am just not used to Java yet.","title":"How to randomly distribute mines for a Minesweeper program","body":"<p>I've gotten up to Test 9/10 of the autochecker and have made my programming now 333 lines of Java code, as per the course requirement (being written in Java, not over XXX amount of lines).

because I figured &quot;Why not?&quot;  I'm very stumped right now.  I come from a C++ hobbyist approach.  I've seen other answers that use a table of m+2/n+2 values which, as a wannabe solo game dev, I would consider a VERY bad practice of doing.  My personal belief is that you should only code what needs to be shown as it needs to be shown.  So, no extra table elements.  If that was done in C++ and compiled under the g++ compiler I would have to believe that, if uninitialized, those extra elements would default to garbage or NULL values and the program would SEGFAULT or interrupt.  I am probably wrong, but I need help fixing my apparent wrong approach to the problem.  Any help is GREATLY appreciated.  I would like to NOT need to simplify this if it can be helped.  I've been on this one single problem for almost two weeks and have worked about three/four hours a night for 5 nights a week on this.  Thank you!</p>\n<p>I cannot think of anything else besides simplifying the code, but that is not my intention.</p>\n<p>EDIT 1: We cannot use any other random function besides a uniform distribution between 0 and n - 1 (0 being cell 1 and n being amount of cells) with Math.random(). I have seen answers by using a &quot;grid&quot; (int[][]) with two extra elements.  As a wannabe game dev, I would not accept extra elements as an answer. Try doing that in C++ while not initializing all values to 0 first.  I guess I am just not used to Java yet.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","gradle"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2994830,"reputation":1,"user_id":2541560,"display_name":"Kayaman"},"score":2,"creation_date":1695146792,"post_id":77136952,"comment_id":135984095,"body_markdown":"How do you know it&#39;s an error and not an ominous info text?","body":"How do you know it&#39;s an error and not an ominous info text?"},{"owner":{"account_id":372682,"reputation":22426,"user_id":721855,"display_name":"aled"},"score":0,"creation_date":1695147438,"post_id":77136952,"comment_id":135984176,"body_markdown":"What command did you use?

Maybe events dispatched or handled on one thread and not another?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","python-3.x","tabula-py"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1507674,"reputation":5017,"user_id":1410669,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"UpAndAdam"},"score":0,"creation_date":1695146133,"post_id":77135890,"comment_id":135984006,"body_markdown":"why dont you use python `help` or `dis` to see what your tabula-py module DOES have?  also what does java have to do with this?","body":"why dont you use python <code>help</code> or <code>dis</code> to see what your tabula-py module DOES have?  also what does java have to do with this?"},{"owner":{"account_id":14751077,"reputation":556,"user_id":10653163,"display_name":"Bal&#225;zs B&#246;rcs&#246;k"},"score":0,"creation_date":1695213410,"post_id":77135890,"comment_id":135993809,"body_markdown":"A better way to ask the question would that: how to use tabula to read a PDF in Python into a variable.

If the count of the controller grows very high, you would have issue in holding the references of the controllers.\r\n 3. Reset feature code is tightly coupled with all the controllers Class’s code(to get and set default values).\r\n 4. Reset feature class (ResetFunctionV2) can access other method of the Controller class’s (adjust) which is undesirable.\r\n\r\n&gt; At the same time, You hear from you Boss that you might have to add a feature wherein each of controllers, on start-up, needs to check for the latest version of driver from company’s hosted driver repository via internet.\r\n\r\nNow you start thinking that this new feature to be added resembles with Reset feature and Issues of Application (V2) will be multiplied if you don’t re-factor your application.\r\n\r\nYou start thinking of using inheritance so that you can take advantage from polymorphic ability of JAVA and you add a new abstract class (ControllerV3) to\r\n\r\n 1. Declare the signature of get and set method.\r\n 2. Contain adjust method implementation which was earlier replicated among all the controllers.\r\n 3. Declare setDefault method so that reset feature can be easily implemented leveraging Polymorphism.\r\n\r\nWith these improvements, you have version 3 of your TV application ready with you.\r\n\r\n&gt;

Keep various part of application loosely coupled.( Reset or Driver Update feature components  don’t need to be made aware of actual controller classes(Volume, Brightness and Colour), any class implementing OnReset or OnStart will be acceptable to Reset or Driver Update feature components respectively).\r\n 2.
