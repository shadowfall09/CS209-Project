Volatile variables.\r\n 2. Interrupt system.\r\n 3. Synchronized (methods or blocks).\r\n 4. wait() + notify() system.\r\n\r\nFor completeness there is also the [`Thread.stop()`][1] and [`Thread.suspend()`][2] methods - but per the documentation they are inherently unsafe and should not be used. Now deprecated for eventual removal. See [*Why are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?*][3].\r\n\r\nAdditionally you should review the [`java.util.concurrent`][4] package - however my understanding is that the concurrent package is built on top of the 4 primitives listed above, as a result it does not provide any additional capabilities (that you couldn&#39;t implement yourself using those primitives).\r\n\r\nThe first two primitives listed above can be viewed as mechanisms to pause/abort running Threads.

The returned string is then printed to the console, and later can be converted to a float for arithmetic calculations.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":28231520,"reputation":11,"user_id":21580666,"display_name":"Sudheer Mishra"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":109,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1682476301,"creation_date":1681819802,"question_id":76044444,"body_markdown":"Actually, I have created a JFrame which detect a serial com ports and after selection of the com ports, I&#39;m getting a input stream data from my (Arduino) and i&#39;m receiving that data into an byte array using the &quot;SerialDataListener&quot; method &quot;event.getReceivedData()&quot; and now i&#39;m trying to parse a data in integer/string form from that byte array...\r\n\r\nArduino&#39;s input is --\\&gt; ##00000000Gas Flow OTP Wet Air          000.00LPM 010.21008.7  which is continuously coming to the serial port after 2 seconds delay..\r\n\r\nI&#39;m getting the same output but one character after one like :\r\n\r\n# \r\n\r\n## \r\n\r\n\\##0\r\n\\##00 and so on....\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve created a Jframe using Drag &amp; Drop facility of Apache Netbeans IDE and added some actions to get com port and here,\r\nThis is my code to read the data of serial com port and adding that data in my jTextArea...

If this issue did not exist my code would look very clean here is a minimized version of how everything looks right now.</p>\n<pre><code>private void recoverData() {\n        final File file = new File(this.getDataFolder(), &quot;data.json&quot;);\n\n        if(file.exists() &amp;&amp; file.length() &gt; 2) {\n            try {\n                final Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create();\n                final Type type = new TypeToken&lt;Map&lt;String, DataObj&gt;&gt;() {}.getType();\n                DataObj.DATA = gson.fromJson(new FileReader(file), type);\n            } catch (IOException e) {\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>public class DataObj implements Comparable&lt;DataObj&gt; {\n   public static transient Map&lt;String, DataObj&gt; DATA = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n\n   // This also contains 20+ more fields (but those all serialize fine)\n   public final Map&lt;Upgrades, PlayerUpgrades&gt; upgradesMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n} \n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>public abstract class PlayerUpgrades implements Serializable {\n    public int level;\n\n    public abstract String upgradeName();\n    public abstract Integer maxLevel();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I then have many &quot;PlayerUpgrades&quot; that extends <code>PlayerUpgrades</code> but I am not sure how to correctly get my upgradesMap to serialize. Does there happen to be a way I can denote something inside of <code>PlayerUpgrades</code> so I can manually create new instances of each class depending on the key from the upgradesMap? I bet I could try and manually serialize everything in my DataObj but since I have tons of fields, I feel like that would take a while and look clunky so how should I approach this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","security"],"owner":{"account_id":20108014,"reputation":63,"user_id":14745033,"display_name":"Developer01561315"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1682469507,"creation_date":1682469507,"question_id":76106376,"body_markdown":"having trouble with spring security here:\r\n\r\nI need:\r\n1. ```/new-pathx/**```  to be with basic authentication\r\n2. ```/health```  permit all.\r\n3. other paths: anyRequest().authenticated()\r\n\r\n\r\nI have done it this way:\r\n\r\n``` @Override\r\n  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\r\n    http\r\n      .antMatcher(&quot;/new-pathx/**&quot;)\r\n      .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS).and()\r\n      .csrf().disable()\r\n      .httpBasic().and()\r\n      .authorizeRequests()\r\n      .antMatchers(&quot;/health&quot;).permitAll()\r\n      .anyRequest()\r\n      .authenticated();\r\n    \r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {\r\n    auth\r\n      .inMemoryAuthentication()\r\n      .withUser(apiUser)\r\n      .password(passwordEncoder.encode(apiPassword))\r\n      .roles(&quot;API_USER&quot;);\r\n  } \r\n``` \r\n\r\nWorks OK for the ```/new-pathx/**``` I can only enter with the user and password.

We recently upgraded to a new version of our e-commerce framework (Broadleaf Commerce) with associated updates to Spring Boot and Java version. Since the upgrade, we are no longer able to connect to the USPS service. We fail as the SSL Handshake does not complete (seems the change cipher request is never answered). The existing production version of the code works as-is.\r\n\r\nThe weird part is that it works locally and if I make a cURL request from the target server, it works. But when I make the call from the application on the target server, it does not complete the handshake.\r\n\r\nI have been searching the internet and stack overflow for answers but have not found one that fixes my issues. Here are the troubleshooting steps I have followed to date:\r\n1. I have tested the code locally and the USPS call works\r\n2. I have tested the server firewall / networking by executing a cURL command from the server. It worked as expected (TLS was negotiated properly)\r\n1. I dockerized the application to validate that the java versions and Java Trust Store certificates were consistent across environments. The dockerized application works on my local machine, it fails on the target machines with the same SSL Handshake errors.\r\n1. I have tested another REST call to another SSL secured endpoint. It worked properly. The differences between it and the USPS call are (1) the second endpoint is internal to our network and (2) the internal endpoint uses TLS 1.2, USPS uses TLS 1.3. Both are supported by the application per the logs.\r\n1. I attempted to force the JVM supported TLS versions using the `jdk.tls.client.protocols` and `https.protocols` properties. This had no effect (which was expected as TLS 1.2 and 1.3 are the current defaults).\r\n1. I have done a WireShark trace on both the cURL command and the Application call. WireShark shows cURL negotiating the Handshake properly. For the app, it seems that the request to change ciphers is never answered.\r\n1. I have verified with USPS that they have not blocked our IPs or anything like that.\r\n\r\nI am out of ideas of what to test to identify the root cause of the issue. Doesn&#39;t seem to be code-related (the code works locally), it doesn&#39;t seem to be server network/firewall related (cURL works on the server). \r\n\r\nWhat is left?

We recently upgraded to a new version of our e-commerce framework (Broadleaf Commerce) with associated updates to Spring Boot and Java version. Since the upgrade, we are no longer able to connect to the USPS service. We fail as the SSL Handshake does not complete (seems the change cipher request is never answered). The existing production version of the code works as-is.</p>\n<p>The weird part is that it works locally and if I make a cURL request from the target server, it works. But when I make the call from the application on the target server, it does not complete the handshake.</p>\n<p>I have been searching the internet and stack overflow for answers but have not found one that fixes my issues. Here are the troubleshooting steps I have followed to date:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I have tested the code locally and the USPS call works</li>\n<li>I have tested the server firewall / networking by executing a cURL command from the server. It worked as expected (TLS was negotiated properly)</li>\n<li>I dockerized the application to validate that the java versions and Java Trust Store certificates were consistent across environments. The dockerized application works on my local machine, it fails on the target machines with the same SSL Handshake errors.</li>\n<li>I have tested another REST call to another SSL secured endpoint. It worked properly. The differences between it and the USPS call are (1) the second endpoint is internal to our network and (2) the internal endpoint uses TLS 1.2, USPS uses TLS 1.3. Both are supported by the application per the logs.</li>\n<li>I attempted to force the JVM supported TLS versions using the <code>jdk.tls.client.protocols</code> and <code>https.protocols</code> properties. This had no effect (which was expected as TLS 1.2 and 1.3 are the current defaults).</li>\n<li>I have done a WireShark trace on both the cURL command and the Application call. WireShark shows cURL negotiating the Handshake properly. For the app, it seems that the request to change ciphers is never answered.</li>\n<li>I have verified with USPS that they have not blocked our IPs or anything like that.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I am out of ideas of what to test to identify the root cause of the issue. Doesn't seem to be code-related (the code works locally), it doesn't seem to be server network/firewall related (cURL works on the server).</p>\n<p>What is left? What am I missing?</p>\n<p>Error Message:</p>\n<pre><code>org.springframework.web.client.ResourceAccessException: I/O error on POST request for &quot;https://stg-secure.shippingapis.com/ShippingAPI.dll&quot;: Remote host terminated the handshake;

We are using OpenAPI 3.0.</p>\n<p>Thanks so much.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","maven","graphql"],"owner":{"account_id":11282967,"reputation":367,"user_id":8274672,"display_name":"lucky"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":77,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1682449801,"creation_date":1682449801,"question_id":76104639,"body_markdown":"I am trying with below maven plugin but getting error: Execution default of goal io.github.deweyjose:graphqlcodegen-maven-plugin:1.14:generate failed: Schema File: /Users/abc/Documents/GitHub/application-name/src/main/resources/graphql does not exist!
