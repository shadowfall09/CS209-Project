But when the query returns more than one Item, it works unexpectedly wrong:\r\n\r\n - The first inflated `item.xml` element (or the one shown first, on top) has its `TextViews` modificated as expected, but for the last item in the list.\r\n - The rest of &quot;inflated elements&quot; have not been changed (it shows just ITEM_LABEL, ITEM_TEXT1 and ITEM_TEXT2 hardcoded strings as they are in the template XML file).\r\n - However, it inflates the XML template `items.size()` times as I planned.\r\n\r\nActually, the objective is that each &quot;inflated `item.xml`&quot; is edited with attributes of each corresponding Item. Just like a ListView would do, but without using ListView at all, because the goal is, actually, bloating an existing `ScrollView` (the main container in the fragment) that shows other different Views outside of the &quot;LinearLayout&quot; dedicated to generate this &quot;list&quot;.

It lists dependencies with old versions that may not work well with the latest versions of Java, your IDE, or other libraries. \r\n\r\nThis is quite frustrating, as you would think the artifact would be kept up-to-date via some automated scripting. After all, the entire point of Maven is to make this kind of configuration chore easy and automated!\r\n\r\nFortunately, you can easily update the version numbers yourself. \r\n\r\nHow do you know what is the latest version number to enter for each dependency? \r\n\r\n - You can look up manually the latest version number using the web site of a Maven repository. Copy-paste the version number to your POM.\r\n - You can let your IDE (IntelliJ, NetBeans, etc.) suggest the latest number as you edit the version number XML element value. You may or may not to type some “help-me” keystroke depending on how your IDE works. Before doing this, be sure to update your IDE’s cache of Maven repository data so it knows the current latest version numbers. For example, in IntelliJ go to preferences, and in the search field for settings, type `repo`, and in the list of known repositories click each `Update` button.  \r\n\r\n## Steps\r\n\r\nFirst, if using your IDE to work with Maven, be sure to update its cache of Maven repository data so you are getting the latest `quickstart` artifact. For example, in IntelliJ, `Preferences` &gt; `Build, Execution, Deployment` &gt; `Build tools` &gt; `Maven` &gt; `Repositories` &gt; `Update` button.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/JDV0j.png&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\nThe initial POM should expand into a bigger one.

It lists dependencies with old versions that may not work well with the latest versions of Java, your IDE, or other libraries.</p>\n<p>This is quite frustrating, as you would think the artifact would be kept up-to-date via some automated scripting. After all, the entire point of Maven is to make this kind of configuration chore easy and automated!</p>\n<p>Fortunately, you can easily update the version numbers yourself.</p>\n<p>How do you know what is the latest version number to enter for each dependency?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can look up manually the latest version number using the web site of a Maven repository. Copy-paste the version number to your POM.</li>\n<li>You can let your IDE (IntelliJ, NetBeans, etc.) suggest the latest number as you edit the version number XML element value. You may or may not to type some “help-me” keystroke depending on how your IDE works. Before doing this, be sure to update your IDE’s cache of Maven repository data so it knows the current latest version numbers. For example, in IntelliJ go to preferences, and in the search field for settings, type <code>repo</code>, and in the list of known repositories click each <code>Update</code> button.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Steps</h2>\n<p>First, if using your IDE to work with Maven, be sure to update its cache of Maven repository data so you are getting the latest <code>quickstart</code> artifact. For example, in IntelliJ, <code>Preferences</code> &gt; <code>Build, Execution, Deployment</code> &gt; <code>Build tools</code> &gt; <code>Maven</code> &gt; <code>Repositories</code> &gt; <code>Update</code> button.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7DVqL.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7DVqL.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JDV0j.png\" />\n<p>The initial POM should expand into a bigger one.

The reason is that I want to control the exact location of additional files parsed -- depending on previous option values.\r\n\r\nExample: When called with the options\r\n```srcfolder=/a/b optionfile=of.txt```, my program should see the additional options read from `/a/b/of.txt`, but when called with ```srcfolder=../c optionfile=of.txt```, it should see those from `../c/of.txt`.\r\n\r\nThe @-file mechanism can&#39;t do that, because it expands ALL the option files (always relative to the current folder, if they&#39;re relative) prior to processing ANY option values.\r\n\r\nSo I&#39;d like to have picoCLI...\r\n* process options &quot;from left to right&quot;,\r\n* recursively parse an option file when it&#39;s mentioned in an `optionfile` option,\r\n* and after that continue with the following options.\r\n\r\nI might be able to solve this by recursively starting to parse from within the annotated setter method:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nConfig cfg = new Config();\r\nCommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(cfg);\r\ncmd.parseArgs(a);\r\n...\r\n\r\npublic class Config {\r\n    @Option(names=&quot;srcfolder&quot;)\r\n    public void setSrcfolder(String path) {\r\n        this.srcfolder=path;\r\n    }\r\n    @Option(names=&quot;optionfile&quot;)\r\n    public void parseOptionFile(String pathAndName) {\r\n        // validate path, do some other housekeeping...\r\n        CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(this /* same Config instance! */ );\r\n        cmd.parseArgs(new String[] { &quot;@&quot;+this.srcfolder + pathAndName });\r\n    }\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThis way several `CommandLine` instances would call setter methods on the same `Config` instance, recursively &quot;interrupting&quot; each other. Now comes the actual question: Is that a problem? \r\n\r\nOf course my `Config` class has state.

Instead, the generated code also includes this property as a class attribute with getter/setter. This causes the JSON output to include the property twice, as shown below.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also tried to remove the property from the OpenAPI `properties` list, leaving intact the `discriminator` part; this way the generated code corresponds to the Jackson&#39;s guidelines and the serialization works just fine.

To be super clear, *the problem here has nothing to do with files in S3*.  This error message has *nothing* to do with the file on your hard drive nor the file that you&#39;re trying to push/pull from S3. The problem is that you&#39;re initializing S3 with something like:\r\n\r\n    AmazonS3 s3Client = new AmazonS3Client(new ProfileCredentialsProvider());\r\n\r\nWhen you do that, it looks in ~/.aws/credentials for a list of profiles. This might work great on your computer but won&#39;t work anywhere that you&#39;re getting AWS access through an IAM role (ex. Lambda, Docker, EC2 instance, etc).   The fix, is to initialize the AmazonS3Client like:\r\n\r\n    AmazonS3 s3Client = new AmazonS3Client();\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re using code that requires some kind of credentials provider, you can also do:\r\n\r\n    AmazonS3 s3Client = new AmazonS3Client(DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.getInstance());\r\n\r\nHopefully that helps the next person.
