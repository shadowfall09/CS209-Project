The problems are here:\r\n\r\n    if (from.getBalance() &lt; 0) {\r\n        throw new InsufficientFundsException();\r\n    } else {\r\n        from.deposit(amount);\r\n        to.withdraw(amount);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe first problem is you are transferring money in the wrong direction!  Money should go from the `from` account to the `to` account.  But you are *depositing* money into the `from` account and *withdrawing* money from the `to` account.\r\n\r\nCustomers won&#39;t be happy about that.\r\n\r\nLets fix that:\r\n\r\n    if (from.getBalance() &lt; 0) {\r\n        throw new InsufficientFundsException();\r\n    } else {\r\n        to.deposit(amount);\r\n        from.withdraw(amount);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe problem now is that we are depositing before we withdraw.  Why is that a problem?  Because between the `from.getBalance()` and `from.withdraw(...)` calls, another thread could make a withdrawl from the `from` account.  That could mean that *our* `from.withdraw(amount)` call could fail.  But we&#39;ve already deposited the money into the `to` account.  Ooops!\r\n\r\nLets fix *that*:\r\n\r\n    if (from.getBalance() &lt; 0) {\r\n        throw new InsufficientFundsException();\r\n    } else {\r\n        from.withdraw(amount);\r\n        // HERE\r\n        to.deposit(amount);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nClose ... \r\n\r\nWhat happens if we get a power dip at the point marked HERE?  Well, if we dealing with real bank accounts, then we would actually be storing the information in a database.  So the values currently in the accounts would be preserved.  But at the point labelled HERE we would have withdrawn money from one account and not deposited it in the other one.  What happens to that money?  Poof!  Gone!\r\n\r\nDoes that matter?  Well it depends on how we frame the requirements.  Assuming that it is OK to represent the bank accounts as (only) in memory objects, I&#39;d say that we can ignore that nicety of surviving power failure during a transfer.  The power failure would blow away the accounts as well.  \r\n\r\nClose enough is good enough, here.  But we can do slightly better.  As we noted, the value in the `from` account can change between the `getBalance()` and `withdraw()` calls, so that the `withdraw()` could fail.  But when you think about it `from.withdraw` is just testing `from.getBalance() &lt; 0` anyway.  So, we can just get rid of the test:\r\n\r\n        from.withdraw(amount);\r\n        to.deposit(amount);\r\n\r\nIf the `from.withdraw(amount)` is going to overdraw the account, it will fail with an exception.  And we won&#39;t then do the `to.deposit(amount)` call.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nNow we could try to implement a `transfer` method that takes two accounts as arguments, and transfers money from one to the other as an atomic operation.  You could conceivably do this by acquiring locks on both accounts before doing the transfer; e.g. like this:\r\n\r\n      public static void transfer(Account from, Account to, long amount {\r\n          synchronized (from) {\r\n              synchronized (to) {\r\n                  from.withdraw(amount);\r\n                  to.deposit(amount);\r\n              }\r\n          }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;(I&#39;m deliberately ignoring the exceptions and exception handling.)&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\nBut *now* we have to worry about deadlock.  For example, if one thread tries to transfer money from A to B, and another simultaneously transfer money from B to A.\r\n\r\nThere are ways to deal with this:\r\n\r\n  - One way is to the `Lock` API and `acquire` the locks with a timeout to detect deadlock.  \r\n  - Another way is write the transfer method to acquire the account locks in the same order when doing `transfer(A,B)` and `transfer(B,A)`.  For example, assuming that `Account` objects have unique account numbers, then lock the `Account` with the lower account number first.\r\n\r\n          public static void transfer(Account from, Account to, long amount {\r\n              if (from.getAccountNo() &lt; to.getAccountNo()) {\r\n                  synchronized (from) {\r\n                      synchronized (to) {\r\n                          from.withdraw(amount);\r\n                          to.deposit(amount);\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n              } else {\r\n                  synchronized (to) {\r\n                      synchronized (from) {\r\n                          from.withdraw(amount);\r\n                          to.deposit(amount);\r\n                      }\r\n                  }\r\n              }\r\n          }","title":"Adding money from one account to another using multithreading","body":"<p>Your solution is not vulnerable to deadlocks because the <code>TransferThread</code> instances are never going to hold more than one lock at a time.</p>\n<p>However, I don't think it is a correct solution.  The problems are here:</p>\n<pre><code>if (from.getBalance() &lt; 0) {\n    throw new InsufficientFundsException();\n} else {\n    from.deposit(amount);\n    to.withdraw(amount);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first problem is you are transferring money in the wrong direction!  Money should go from the <code>from</code> account to the <code>to</code> account.  But you are <em>depositing</em> money into the <code>from</code> account and <em>withdrawing</em> money from the <code>to</code> account.</p>\n<p>Customers won't be happy about that.</p>\n<p>Lets fix that:</p>\n<pre><code>if (from.getBalance() &lt; 0) {\n    throw new InsufficientFundsException();\n} else {\n    to.deposit(amount);\n    from.withdraw(amount);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The problem now is that we are depositing before we withdraw.  Why is that a problem?  Because between the <code>from.getBalance()</code> and <code>from.withdraw(...)</code> calls, another thread could make a withdrawl from the <code>from</code> account.  That could mean that <em>our</em> <code>from.withdraw(amount)</code> call could fail.  But we've already deposited the money into the <code>to</code> account.  Ooops!</p>\n<p>Lets fix <em>that</em>:</p>\n<pre><code>if (from.getBalance() &lt; 0) {\n    throw new InsufficientFundsException();\n} else {\n    from.withdraw(amount);\n    // HERE\n    to.deposit(amount);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Close ...</p>\n<p>What happens if we get a power dip at the point marked HERE?  Well, if we dealing with real bank accounts, then we would actually be storing the information in a database.  So the values currently in the accounts would be preserved.  But at the point labelled HERE we would have withdrawn money from one account and not deposited it in the other one.  What happens to that money?  Poof!  Gone!</p>\n<p>Does that matter?  Well it depends on how we frame the requirements.  Assuming that it is OK to represent the bank accounts as (only) in memory objects, I'd say that we can ignore that nicety of surviving power failure during a transfer.  The power failure would blow away the accounts as well.</p>\n<p>Close enough is good enough, here.  But we can do slightly better.  As we noted, the value in the <code>from</code> account can change between the <code>getBalance()</code> and <code>withdraw()</code> calls, so that the <code>withdraw()</code> could fail.  But when you think about it <code>from.withdraw</code> is just testing <code>from.getBalance() &lt; 0</code> anyway.

I want Jackson to ignore these other fields using the `@JsonIgnoreProperties` annotation, and I also want them to not be persisted in the database by using the `@Transient` annotation. I&#39;ve generated the getters and setters using Lombok.\r\n\r\nInitially, I had a code snippet that worked well. It was responsible for displaying a user&#39;s persisted conversations on the /conversations page. Here&#39;s the code snippet I was using:\r\n```\r\nmodel.addAttribute(&quot;conversations&quot;,\r\n                objectMapper.writeValueAsString(userConversations));   \r\n```\r\nThis code has working fine until I&#39;ve added field `randomTopics` and method `getRandomTopic()` to my **Conversation** class. The method is designed to get random topic if one of the users in conversation has requested it. \r\n```\r\n@Transient\r\nprivate List&lt;String&gt; randomTopics;\r\n\r\n//...\r\n\r\npublic String getRandomTopic() {\r\n    return randomTopics.get(new Random().nextInt(randomTopics.size()));\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe `randomTopics` list is initialized from a txt file and isn&#39;t stored in the database. The problem arises when a user wants to view their previous conversations. The application retrieves the conversations from the database, but the `randomTopics` field remains null. Strangely, Jackson seems to be calling the `getRandomTopic()` method during the mapping process, which causes a **JsonMappingException** and a **NullPointerException** in the `getRandomTopic()` method.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, I noticed that if I remove the &#39;get&#39; prefix from the method name (`getRandomTopic()` becomes `randomTopic()`), the issue disappears. However, the problem resurfaces if the method name starts with &#39;get&#39;. Why does this happen?\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s another curious aspect: I also have a Map field in the same class, similar to the `randomTopics` list. This field is also ignored by Jackson, and it has a method that starts with &quot;get&quot; to retrieve some topic from Map. The difference lies in the return type of this method; it returns a custom class instead of a String. In this case, Jackson never calls the method (I verified this with a debugger).\r\n\r\nAny insights into why this is happening would be greatly appreciated.

Here's the code snippet I was using:</p>\n<pre><code>model.addAttribute(&quot;conversations&quot;,\n                objectMapper.writeValueAsString(userConversations));   \n</code></pre>\n<p>This code has working fine until I've added field <code>randomTopics</code> and method <code>getRandomTopic()</code> to my <strong>Conversation</strong> class. The method is designed to get random topic if one of the users in conversation has requested it.</p>\n<pre><code>@Transient\nprivate List&lt;String&gt; randomTopics;\n\n//...\n\npublic String getRandomTopic() {\n    return randomTopics.get(new Random().nextInt(randomTopics.size()));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>randomTopics</code> list is initialized from a txt file and isn't stored in the database. The problem arises when a user wants to view their previous conversations. The application retrieves the conversations from the database, but the <code>randomTopics</code> field remains null. Strangely, Jackson seems to be calling the <code>getRandomTopic()</code> method during the mapping process, which causes a <strong>JsonMappingException</strong> and a <strong>NullPointerException</strong> in the <code>getRandomTopic()</code> method.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, I noticed that if I remove the 'get' prefix from the method name (<code>getRandomTopic()</code> becomes <code>randomTopic()</code>), the issue disappears. However, the problem resurfaces if the method name starts with 'get'. Why does this happen?</p>\n<p>There's another curious aspect: I also have a Map field in the same class, similar to the <code>randomTopics</code> list. This field is also ignored by Jackson, and it has a method that starts with &quot;get&quot; to retrieve some topic from Map. The difference lies in the return type of this method; it returns a custom class instead of a String. In this case, Jackson never calls the method (I verified this with a debugger).</p>\n<p>Any insights into why this is happening would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","ssl","apache-camel"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3421244,"reputation":35883,"user_id":2868801,"display_name":"dave_thompson_085"},"score":0,"creation_date":1691784008,"post_id":76883476,"comment_id":135543569,"body_markdown":"**IT IS NOT using TLSv1.2.** The fixed version fields in ClientHello and ServerHello for TLSv1.3 continue to use the value (0x0303) for v1.2, only the contents of the supported_versions _extension_ specify 1.3, and the ones in your trace do.

I'm running this command to start it: <code>&quot;mvn gluonfx:build -e -X -f pom.xml&quot;</code>. It seems like I'm running into an issue with <code>graalVM</code> conflicting with <code>Spring</code>/<code>bytebuddy</code> involving reflection that causes classes to be initialized that should not be initialized until runtime. However, I've tried <code>--initialize-at-run-time</code> arguments for just about every class I could think of being potentially problematic, but all the same classes still seem to get initialized. Any ideas of what is causing this/how to fix it?

Relocates dependencies to the &#39;correct&#39; configuration.\r\n\r\nTo apply the rule, add:\r\n\r\n    gradleLint.rules += &#39;unused-dependency&#39;\r\n\r\nDetails of [Unused Dependency Rule][3] is given in the last part.\r\n\r\n**To apply the Gradle lint plugin:**\r\n\r\n    buildscript { repositories { jcenter() } }\r\n    plugins {\r\n      id &#39;nebula.lint&#39; version &#39;0.30.2&#39;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Alternatively:**\r\n\r\n    buildscript {\r\n      repositories { jcenter() }\r\n      dependencies {\r\n        classpath &#39;com.netflix.nebula:gradle-lint-plugin:latest.release&#39;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    apply plugin: &#39;nebula.lint&#39;\r\n\r\n**Define which rules you would like to lint against:**\r\n\r\n    gradleLint.rules = [&#39;all-dependency&#39;] // Add as many rules here as you&#39;d like\r\n\r\nFor an enterprise build, we recommend defining the lint rules in a init.gradle script or in a Gradle script that is included via the Gradle apply from mechanism.\r\n\r\nFor multimodule projects, we recommend applying the plugin in an `allprojects` block:\r\n\r\n    allprojects {\r\n      apply plugin: &#39;nebula.lint&#39;\r\n      gradleLint.rules = [&#39;all-dependency&#39;] // Add as many rules here as you&#39;d like\r\n    }\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDetails of [Unused Dependency Rule][3] is given in this part\r\n---\r\nTo apply the rule, add:\r\n\r\n    gradleLint.rules += &#39;unused-dependency&#39;\r\n\r\nThe rule inspects compiled binaries emanating from your project&#39;s [source sets][4] looking for class references and matches those references to the dependencies that you have declared in your [dependencies][5] block.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the rule makes the following adjustments to dependencies:\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 1. Removes unused dependencies\r\n\r\n\r\n - Family-style jars like com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk are removed, as\r\n   they don&#39;t contain any code\r\n\r\n### 2. Promotes transitive dependencies that are used directly by your code to explicit first order dependencies\r\n\r\n\r\n - This has the side effect of breaking up family style JAR files, like\r\n   com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk, into the parts that you are actually\r\n   using, and adding those as first order dependencies\r\n\r\n### 3. Relocates dependencies to the &#39;correct&#39; configuration\r\n\r\n - Webjars are moved to the runtime configuration\r\n - JAR files that don&#39;t contain any classes *and* content outside of META-INF are\r\n   moved to runtime\r\n - &#39;xerces&#39;, &#39;xercesImpl&#39;, &#39;xml-apis&#39; should always be runtime scoped\r\n - Service providers (JAR files containing META-INF/services) like\r\n   mysql-connector-java are moved to runtime if there isn&#39;t any provable\r\n   compile-time reference\r\n - Dependencies are moved to the highest source set configuration\r\n   possible. For example, &#39;junit&#39; is relocated to testCompile unless\r\n   there is an explicit dependency on it in the main source set (rare).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Previous plugins\r\n---\r\nFor your kind information, I want to share about previous plugins\r\n\r\n1.

I was wondering if someone had a better suggestion or way to turn this .csv InputStream into a POJO or could point me in the right direction.</p>\n<p>CODE:</p>\n<pre><code>    @Bean\n    public IntegrationFlow sftpFileTransferFlow(SessionFactory&lt;SftpClient.DirEntry&gt; sftpSessionFactory,\n                                                IntegrationFlowProperties properties,\n                                                MessageChannel inboundFilesMessageChannel) {\n\n        return IntegrationFlow\n                .from(Sftp.inboundStreamingAdapter(new RemoteFileTemplate&lt;&gt;(sftpSessionFactory))\n                          .filter(new SftpRegexPatternFileListFilter(properties.getRemoteFilePattern()))\n                          .remoteDirectory(properties.getRemoteDirectory()),\n                      e -&gt; e.id(&quot;sftpInboundAdapter&quot;)\n                            .autoStartup(true)\n                            .poller(Pollers.fixedRate(5000)))\n                .log(LoggingHandler.Level.DEBUG, &quot;DataSftpToKafkaIntegrationFlow&quot;,\n                     &quot;headers['file_remoteDirectory'] + + T(java.io.File).separator  + headers['file_remoteFile']&quot;)\n                .channel(inboundFilesMessageChannel)\n                .get();\n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    public IntegrationFlow readCsvFileFlow(MessageChannel inboundFilesMessageChannel,\n                                           QueueChannel kafkaPojoMessageChannel) {\n        \n        return IntegrationFlow.from(inboundFilesMessageChannel)\n                              .split(Files.splitter()\n                                          .markers(true)\n                                          .charset(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)\n                                          .firstLineAsHeader(&quot;myHeaders&quot;)\n                                          .applySequence(true))\n                              // .transform(new StreamToEmailInteractionConverter()) // TODO: Figure this out so it doesn't get put on topic as .csv\n                              .transform(new ObjectToJsonTransformer())\n                              .log(LoggingHandler.Level.DEBUG,\n                                   &quot;DataSftpToKafkaIntegrationFlow&quot;,\n                                   m -&gt; &quot;Payload: &quot; + m.getPayload())\n                              .channel(kafkaPojoMessageChannel)\n                              .get();\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>DOMAIN CLASS:</p>\n<pre><code>@Getter\n@Setter\npublic class EmailInteractionTest {\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;email&quot;)\n    private String email;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;RECIPIENT_ID&quot;)\n    private String recipientId;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;ENCODED_RECIPIENT_ID&quot;)\n    private String encodedRecipientId;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;contactId&quot;)\n    private String contactId;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;code&quot;)\n    private String code;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;messageId&quot;)\n    private String messageId;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;userAgent&quot;)\n    private String userAgent;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;messageName&quot;)\n    private String messageName;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;mailingTemplateId&quot;)\n    private String mailingTemplateId;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;subjectLine&quot;)\n    private String subjectLine;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;docType&quot;)\n    private String docType;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;reportId&quot;)\n    private String reportId;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;sendType&quot;)\n    private String sendType;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;bounceType&quot;)\n    private String bounceType;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;urlDescription&quot;)\n    private String urlDescription;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;clickUrl&quot;)\n    private String clickUrl;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;optOutDetails&quot;)\n    private String optOutDetails;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;messageGroupId&quot;)\n    private String messageGroupId;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;programId&quot;)\n    private String programId;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;timestamp&quot;)\n    private String timestamp;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;originatedFrom&quot;)\n    private String originatedFrom;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;eventId&quot;)\n    private String eventId;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;externalSystemName&quot;)\n    private String externalSystemName;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;externalSystemReferenceId&quot;)\n    private String externalSystemReferenceId;\n    @CsvBindByName(column = &quot;trackingCode&quot;)\n    private String trackingCode;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>StreamToEmailInteractionConverter()</code> is the class I need to implement.

The call passes without throwing any openLG errors (checked by calling `glGetError`), but the data in the texture is different from the original data when I try to verify it.\r\n\r\nFirst I bind the 3d-texture:\r\n\r\n```\r\nglBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_3D, zId);\r\nsetData(data);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe data should be set by this function:\r\n```\r\nprivate void setData(short[][][] data)\r\n    {\r\n        ShortBuffer buffer = arrayToBuffer(data);\r\n        glTexImage3D(GL_TEXTURE_3D, 0, GL_R16I, 16, 16, 16, 0, GL_RED_INTEGER, GL_SHORT, buffer);\r\n        // DEBUG: print data before and after

    int err = glGetError();\r\n        if(err != GL_NO_ERROR) System.out.printf(&quot;0x%08X%n&quot;, err);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the data is converted from array into a ShortBuffer by this function:\r\n```\r\nprivate static ShortBuffer arrayToBuffer(short[][][] data)\r\n    {\r\n        int dataLength = data.length * data[0].length * data[0][0].length;\r\n        ShortBuffer buffer = ShortBuffer.allocate(dataLength);\r\n        for(short[][] arr2d : data)\r\n            for(short[] arr : arr2d)\r\n            {\r\n                buffer.put(arr);\r\n            }\r\n        buffer.flip();\r\n        return buffer;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is one example of the print results:\r\n```\r\nOriginal: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

integers by using internal format `GL_R32I` and type `GL_INT`, but that didn&#39;t work either. I also tried using internal format `GL_R16` with format `GL_RED`, but that produced similarly unexpected results. For science I also tried `GL_R16UI` even though I need the values to be signed, but even that didn&#39;t work.

I bind the 3d-texture:</p>\n<pre><code>glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_3D, zId);\nsetData(data);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The data should be set by this function:</p>\n<pre><code>private void setData(short[][][]

But when I jar up my classes and try to run it with java 1.6 in the same cmd window, I start getting exceptions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>C:\\dev\\myapp\\src\\common\\datagen&gt;C:/apps/jdk1.6.0_07/bin/java.exe -classpath C:\\myapp\\libs\\commons -logging-1.1.jar -server -jar DataGen.jar\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/commons/logging/LogFactory\n    at com.example.myapp.fomc.common.datagen.DataGenerationTest.&lt;clinit&gt;(Unknown Source)\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory\n    at java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run(URLClassLoader.java:200)\n    at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)\n    at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:188)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:306)\n    at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:276)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:251)\n    at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassInternal(ClassLoader.java:319)\n    ... 1 more\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The funny thing is, the offending LogFactory seems to be in commons-logging-1.1.jar, which is in the class path specified.  The jar file (yep, it's really there):</p>\n\n<pre><code>C:\\dev\\myapp\\src\\common\\datagen&gt;dir C:\\myapp\\libs\\commons-logging-1.1.jar\n Volume in drive C is Local Disk\n Volume Serial Number is ECCD-A6A7\n\n Directory of C:\\myapp\\libs\n\n12/11/2007  11:46 AM            52,915 commons-logging-1.1.jar\n           1 File(s)         52,915 bytes\n           0 Dir(s)  10,956,947,456 bytes free\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The contents of the commons-logging-1.1.jar file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>C:\\dev\\myapp\\src\\common\\datagen&gt;jar -tf C:\\myapp\\libs\\commons-logging-1.1.jar\nMETA-INF/\nMETA-INF/MANIFEST.MF\norg/\norg/apache/\norg/apache/commons/\norg/apache/commons/logging/\norg/apache/commons/logging/impl/\nMETA-INF/LICENSE.txt\nMETA-INF/NOTICE.txt\norg/apache/commons/logging/Log.class\norg/apache/commons/logging/LogConfigurationException.class\norg/apache/commons/logging/LogFactory$1.class\norg/apache/commons/logging/LogFactory$2.class\norg/apache/commons/logging/LogFactory$3.class\norg/apache/commons/logging/LogFactory$4.class\norg/apache/commons/logging/LogFactory$5.class\norg/apache/commons/logging/LogFactory.class\n...

Just to cull the answers, for now at least, third party solutions to this are probably out due to licensing restrictions and company policies (e.g.: tools for creating exe's or packaging up jars).  The ultimate goal is to create a jar that can be copied from my development Windows box to a Linux server (with any dependent jars) and used to populate a database (so classpaths may wind up being different between development and deployment environments).

(Unless I want to construct a giant <code>switch</code> case in my input parsing method and test for every possible Ctrl+key combination, which would be... stupid? inelegant?)</p>\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n<p>I looked at <a href=\"https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JNativeHook</a> as suggested by @DevilsHnd, and while it's probably nice for some applications, it has a hard dependency on X11, which means that it does not work in remote sessions over SSH, in the pure text mode (e.g. on a server installation without the graphical interface), or in Wayland.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","httpurlconnection","java-io"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1914082,"reputation":20095,"user_id":1727092,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Pragnani"},"score":1,"creation_date":1364190856,"post_id":15608499,"comment_id":22136526,"body_markdown":"I think this is your network problem","body":"I think this is your network problem"},{"owner":{"account_id":2213378,"reputation":2479,"user_id":1954619,"accept_rate":64,"display_name":"Akhilesh"},"score":2,"creation_date":1364190957,"post_id":15608499,"comment_id":22136566,"body_markdown":"I tested this on a hispeed wi-fi...still this occurs frequently...","body":"I tested this on a hispeed wi-fi...still this occurs frequently..."},{"owner":{"account_id":330005,"reputation":132780,"user_id":653856,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Raghunandan"},"score":0,"creation_date":1364191129,"post_id":15608499,"comment_id":22136621,"body_markdown":"set a connection timeout.","body":"set a connection timeout."},{"owner":{"account_id":1238981,"reputation":132436,"user_id":1202025,"accept_rate":80,"display_name":"ρяσѕρєя K"},"score":1,"creation_date":1364191286,"post_id":15608499,"comment_id":22136679,"body_markdown":"@akh :  make sure u are using right webservice url  for making httppost request or server is running","body":"@akh :  make sure u are using right webservice url  for making httppost request or server is running"},{"owner":{"account_id":330005,"reputation":132780,"user_id":653856,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Raghunandan"},"score":0,"creation_date":1364191309,"post_id":15608499,"comment_id":22136685,"body_markdown":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4577804/http-connection-timeout-issues","body":"<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4577804/http-connection-timeout-issues\" title=\"http connection timeout issues\">stackoverflow.com/questions/4577804/&hellip;</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":1914082,"reputation":20095,"user_id":1727092,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Pragnani"},"score":1,"creation_date":1364191852,"post_id":15608499,"comment_id":22136843,"body_markdown":"@akh It is not about the speed of the connection, but it is because of the response from the server, try to call the same url from the browser window and check how much time will it take..","body":"@akh It is not about the speed of the connection, but it is because of the response from the server, try to call the same url from the browser window and check how much time will it take.."},{"owner":{"account_id":1914082,"reputation":20095,"user_id":1727092,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Pragnani"},"score":0,"creation_date":1364191997,"post_id":15608499,"comment_id":22136883,"body_markdown":"@ρяσѕρєяK 565 left to reach 30k. congs bro..I appreciate your contribution in SO.","body":"@ρяσѕρєяK 565 left to reach 30k. congs bro..I appreciate your contribution in SO."},{"owner":{"account_id":71739,"reputation":307163,"user_id":207421,"accept_rate":82,"display_name":"user207421"},"score":2,"creation_date":1364258715,"post_id":15608499,"comment_id":22169545,"body_markdown":"@Raghunandan Setting a connection timeout won&#39;t cure a connection timeout problem.","body":"@Raghunandan Setting a connection timeout won&#39;t cure a connection timeout problem."},{"owner":{"account_id":11253195,"reputation":403,"user_id":8253780,"display_name":"Pranay Soni"},"score":0,"creation_date":1524477838,"post_id":15608499,"comment_id":86972704,"body_markdown":"@EJP can you please suggest a better solution for setting the connection Timeout period in volley","body":"@EJP can you please suggest a better solution for setting the connection Timeout period in volley"},{"owner":{"account_id":11671167,"reputation":5710,"user_id":8546205,"display_name":"Rahul Kushwaha"},"score":0,"creation_date":1547796193,"post_id":15608499,"comment_id":95322800,"body_markdown":"In My case it comes when API is blocked i,e time duration for hosting is expired.\n   From all the discussion above.I think it comes when Network Problem.There is not any issues in your code.","body":"In My case it comes when API is blocked i,e time duration for hosting is expired.
