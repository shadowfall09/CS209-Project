It has been removed from `location` but hasn&#39;t been added to `inventory` yet.\r\n\r\nImagine a file system. Let&#39;s say you have a directory with 2 files. You want to remove the first line from the first file and add that line to the second file. If you actually just do that (edit both files), there will always be a moment-in-time when any other program observing the directory can observe invalid state (where it either doesn&#39;t see that line in either file, or sees it in both).\r\n\r\nSo, instead, you&#39;d do this: You make a new dir, copy both files over, tweak both files, and then rename, in one atomic action, the newly created dir onto its old name. Any program, assuming they &#39;grab a handle to the directory&#39; (which is how it works on e.g. linux), cannot possibly observe invalid state. They either get the old state (line is in file 1 and not in file 2), or the new state (line is in file 2 and not in file 1).\r\n\r\nYou can use the same approach to your code, where all state is immutable, all modifications are done via builders (mutable variants) or one step at a time, with immutable trees in between, and once you&#39;re done all you do is take a single field of type `GameState` and update it to reference the new state - java guarantees that if you write: `someObj = someExpr`, that other threads will either see the old state or the new state, they can&#39;t see half the pointer or other such nonsense. (You&#39;d still need `volatile` or `synchronized` or something else to ensure that all threads get the update in a timely fashion).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf threading just doesn&#39;t matter, there is one more alternative:\r\n\r\nGameState actions.\r\n\r\nInstead of just invoking `location.remove`, what you can do instead is work with a gamestate action. Such an action knows both how to do the job (remove the item from the location), but it also knows precisely how to _undo_ the job.\r\n\r\nYou can then write a little framework, where you make a list of gamestate actions (here: the action that can do or undo &#39;remove from location&#39;, and one that can do or undo &#39;add this to inventory&#39;). You then hand the framework the list of actions. This framework will then go through each action, one at a time, catching exceptions. If it catches one, it will go in reverse order and call undo on every gamestate action.\r\n\r\nThis way, you have a manageable strategy, where you can just run a bunch of operations in sequence, knowing that if one of them fails, everything done so far will be undone properly.\r\n\r\n__This strategy is utterly impossible to make work correctly in a multi-threaded environment without global state-locking__, so make sure you aren&#39;t going to need that in the future.\r\n\r\nThis is all quite complex.

That&#39;d be one way to go. For convenient access, combine it with a nice abstraction over java&#39;s core DB access layer, such as [JDBI](https://www.jdbi.org/) and you&#39;ve got a system that:\r\n\r\n* Can save files trivially.\r\n* Lets you run complex queries in a fast fashion, such as &#39;find all game rooms with a bleeding monster on it&#39;.\r\n* Fully supports transactions.\r\n\r\nYou would just run these commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSTART TRANSACTION;\r\nDELETE FROM itemsAtLocation WHERE loc = 18 AND item = 356;\r\nINSERT INTO inventory (itemId) VALUES (356);\r\nCOMMIT;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand either both happen or neither happens.

I update the GUI everytime the user interacts with the application (like a mouse move) or when the process() method of the Swingworker is called. The Swingworker doesn&#39;t do anything right now, it just grabs the mouse location from the GUI and sends it back as a clone through the publish() and process() methods (I&#39;m just doing this to see what I can and can&#39;t do when communicating between threads because multithreading is still fairly new to me).

The Swingworker doesn't do anything right now, it just grabs the mouse location from the GUI and sends it back as a clone through the publish() and process() methods (I'm just doing this to see what I can and can't do when communicating between threads because multithreading is still fairly new to me).

Any ideas on what I can do to fix this?\nInput file examples: 23 23 44 55 100 0 39 58 thing</p>\n<p>code:</p>\n<pre><code>           Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);\n           //asks for

That leaves the code looking something like</p>\n<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {\n    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);\n    System.out.print(&quot;Enter a Integer:&quot;);\n    int count = 0, max = Integer.MIN_VALUE, userInput;\n    while ((userInput = input.nextInt()) != 0) {\n        if (userInput &gt; max) {\n            max = userInput;\n            count = 1;\n        } else if (userInput == max) {\n            count++;\n        }\n    }\n    System.out.println(&quot;The max number is &quot; + max);\n    System.out.println(&quot;The count is &quot; + count);\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":22991840,"reputation":11,"user_id":17117196,"display_name":"Trevon Corbett"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1035,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":69512128,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1633886560,"creation_date":1633832536,"question_id":69511844,"body_markdown":"So I&#39;m learn java for the first time and can&#39;t seem to figure how to set up a while loop properly . \r\n\r\nmy assignment is Write a program that reads integers, finds the largest of them, and counts its occurrences.\r\n\r\nBut I have 2 problems and some handicaps.

I cannot imagine a scenario where that is the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nThe `LocalDateTime` class purposely lacks any concept of time zone or offset-from-UTC. So **`LocalDateTime`  cannot represent a moment**, cannot track a specific point on the timeline. \r\n\r\n# Determine offset in use by a time zone at a particular moment\r\n\r\nI cannot discern from your prose exactly what is your goal. But looking at your code, it seems you want to know what is the current offset-from-UTC in effect for a particular time zone. That is quite easy. \r\n\r\nA [`ZoneId`][1] represents a particular time zone. Each time zone has a [`ZoneRules`][2] object containing the history of the past, present, and future changes to the offset used by the people in that region. \r\n\r\nPass a moment (an `Instant`) to those rules to ask for the offset in effect at that time. The result is a [`ZoneOffset`][3], a number of hours-minutes-seconds. \r\n\r\n    ZoneId z = ZoneId.of( &quot;America/New_York&quot; ) ;\r\n    ZoneRules rules = z.getRules() ;\r\n    Instant now = Instant.now() ;  // Capture the current moment as seen in UTC (an offset of zero hours-minutes-seconds). \r\n    ZoneOffset offset = rules.getOffset( now ) ;\r\n\r\nYou can generate text in standard ISO 8601 format to represent that offset value by calling `ZoneOffset#toString`. \r\n\r\n    ZonedDateTime zdt = now.atZone( z ) ;\r\n    String message = zdt.toString() + &quot; has an offset of &quot; + offset + &quot;.&quot; ;\r\n    System.out.println( message ) ;\r\n\r\nSee this [code run live at IdeOne.com][4].\r\n\r\n&gt;2021-10-09T00:36:54.432057-04:00[America/New_York] has an offset of -04:00.\r\n\r\nYou said:\r\n\r\n&gt;No matter what I set my PC time to it always shows -04:00 for zoneOffSet.\r\n\r\nOf course. No matter where you are in the world, the people in the New York region set their clocks four hours behind UTC.

This not only mitigates potential API transaction failures but also is a requisite to validate &amp; encode parameter or element/property/uri name.\r\n\r\n&gt; That said, a sample MarkLogic Java API implementation is:\r\n\r\n 1. Create a dynamic query construct in the filesystem, in my case, `product-query-option.xml` (use the query value directly: `Chooser–Option`)\r\n```\r\n&lt;search xmlns=&quot;http://marklogic.com/appservices/search&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;query&gt;\r\n        &lt;and-query&gt;\r\n            &lt;collection-constraint-query&gt;\r\n                &lt;constraint-name&gt;Collection&lt;/constraint-name&gt;\r\n                &lt;uri&gt;proto&lt;/uri&gt;\r\n            &lt;/collection-constraint-query&gt;\r\n            &lt;range-constraint-query&gt;\r\n                &lt;constraint-name&gt;ProductType&lt;/constraint-name&gt;\r\n                &lt;value&gt;Chooser–Option&lt;/value&gt;\r\n            &lt;/range-constraint-query&gt;\r\n        &lt;/and-query&gt;\r\n    &lt;/query&gt;\r\n&lt;/search&gt;\r\n```\r\n2. Deploy the persistent query options to modules database, in my case, `search-lexis.xml`, the options file is like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;options xmlns=&quot;http://marklogic.com/appservices/search&quot;&gt;\r\n     &lt;constraint name=&quot;Collection&quot;&gt;\r\n         &lt;collection prefix=&quot;&quot;/&gt;\r\n     &lt;/constraint&gt;\r\n     &lt;constraint name=&quot;ProductType&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;range type=&quot;xs:string&quot; collation=&quot;http://marklogic.com/collation/en/S1&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;path-index xmlns:prod=&quot;schema://fc.fasset/product&quot;&gt;/prod:requestProduct/prod:_metaData/prod:productType&lt;/path-index&gt;\r\n        &lt;/range&gt;\r\n     &lt;/constraint&gt;\r\n&lt;/options&gt;\r\n```\r\n3. Follow on from [Dynamic Java Search][1]\r\n\r\n```\r\n        File file = new File(&quot;src/main/resources/queryoption/product-query-option.xml&quot;);\r\n\r\n        FileHandle fileHandle = new FileHandle(file);\r\n\r\n        RawCombinedQueryDefinition rcqDef = queryMgr.newRawCombinedQueryDefinition(fileHandle, queryOption);\r\n```\r\n\r\n - You can, assuredly, combine the query and the options as one handle in `QueryDefinition`. \r\n\r\n 4. Your original node-replace is translated as [Java Partial Update][2]\r\n\r\n - make sure the `DocumentPatchBuilder` `setNamespaces` with the correct `NamespaceContext`.\r\n\r\n5. For batch data operation, the performant approach is MarkLogic Data Movement: instantiate the `QueryBatcher` with the searched Uris, supply the replace value or data fragment `PatchBuilder.replaceValue`\r\n, and complete the batch with \r\n`dbClient.newXMLDocumentManager().patch(uri, patchHandle);`\r\n\r\n&gt; MarkLogic Data Services: If you succeed above, perhaps, then go at a more robust and scalable enterprise SOA approach, please review [Data Services][3].\r\n\r\n- The implementation with Gradle is like:\r\n\r\n[![Data Services Implementations][4]][4]\r\n\r\n(Note, all of the transformation metrics should be parameters, including path/element/property name, namespace, value…etc. Nothing is hardcoded.) One proxy service declared in `service.json` can serve multiple end points (under `/root/df-ds/fxd` ) with different types of modules which give you the free rein to develop pure Java or extend the development platform to handle complex data operations.  \r\n\r\n&gt; If these operations are persistent node update, you should consider in-memory node transform before the ingestion. Besides the MarkLogic data transformation tools, you can harness the power of XSLT2+.\r\n \r\n&gt; Saxon `XPathFactory` could be a serviceable vehicle to query/transform node.
