I receive objects in JSON format containing strings and other nested objects and arrays. The nested objects might contain strings with commas, : and /. I get an error when I pass objects containing commas, : and / in their strings.\nI understand those characters are used for parsing JSON objects and therefore when included in the strings they can mess up the conversion. Is there a way to deal with that?</p>\n<p>My code:</p>\n<pre><code>public String setProperties(@RequestBody Map&lt;String, Object&gt; body) throws JSONException {\n        logger.info(&quot;-&gt;&quot;+ body); \n        System.out.println(body);\n        \n        String id = body.get(&quot;id&quot;).toString();\n        String name = body.get(&quot;name&quot;).toString();\n        JSONArray props = new JSONArray(body.get(&quot;properties&quot;).toString());\n</code></pre>\n<p>An example of a sent object:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    &quot;id&quot;:4,\n    &quot;name&quot;:&quot;test&quot;,\n    &quot;properties&quot;:[\n        {\n            &quot;house&quot;:{\n                &quot;address&quot;:&quot;elm street, 2&quot;, ----&gt; this (,) is the responsible part for the error\n                &quot;postcode&quot;:&quot;000012&quot;,\n                &quot;area&quot;:&quot;001&quot;\n            },\n            &quot;code&quot;:&quot;XXX&quot;,\n            &quot;lng&quot;:&quot;40.3895&quot;,\n            &quot;created&quot;:&quot;2022-04-06:T0:818000200&quot;, ---&gt; the (:), also deliver an error\n       }\n    ]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The error I get:</p>\n<pre><code>Expected a ':' after a key at character 43\n    at org.json.JSONTokener.syntaxError(JSONTokener.java:410)\n    at org.json.JSONObject.&lt;init&gt;(JSONObject.java:203)\n    at org.json.JSONTokener.nextValue(JSONTokener.java:344)\n    at org.json.JSONObject.&lt;init&gt;(JSONObject.java:205)\n    at org.json.JSONTokener.nextValue(JSONTokener.java:344)\n    at org.json.JSONArray.&lt;init&gt;(JSONArray.java:125)\n    at org.json.JSONArray.&lt;init&gt;(JSONArray.java:157)\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","xml","eclipse","maven"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":13796,"reputation":19353,"user_id":27905,"display_name":"nitind"},"score":0,"creation_date":1669999781,"post_id":74656915,"comment_id":131778233,"body_markdown":"What *does* it have?

So, when I'm constructing the pipeline and trying to define the headers I find a problem, I don't have the headers yet:</p>\n<pre><code>somePCollection.apply(&quot;writing stuff&quot;, TextIO.write()\n                        .to(&quot;gs://some_bucket/somefile_name&quot;)\n                        .withSuffix(&quot;.csv&quot;).withHeader(I CAN'T SET THE HEADERS HERE BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THEM));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Probably you wondering how the data looks like? At this point my Pcollection structure looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>user_id, fst_name, lst_name, team_list\n</code></pre>\n<p>PCOllection Example:</p>\n<pre><code>1111,DANNY,CRUISE, TEAM34,TEAM12,TEAM4\n2222,CARLOS,SMITH, TEAM34,TEAM44,TEAM12\n33333,SASHA,CONOR, TEAM5,TEAM34,TEAM44\n</code></pre>\n<p>The expected CSV file with headers would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>USER_ID,FST_NAME,LST_NAME,TEAM34,TEAM12,TEAM4,TEAM44,TEAM5\n1111,    DANNY,   CRUISE,   1,    1,     1,   0,    0\n2222,    CARLOS,  ,SMITH,  1,    1,     0,   1,    0\n33333,    SASHA,  ,CONOR,  1,    0,     0,   1,    1\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, in the headers I need all the unique teams as columns (obviously the columns can vary between executions) and each row would have 1 or 0 depending of the user is in that team or not.</p>\n<p>It looks like the headers can only be defined at pipeline construction time.</p>\n<p>I've been trying to find a way to &quot;cheat&quot; apache beam and accomplish this in a single pipeline, but I'm starting to think that the only way to get this is by executing a separated job/pipeline to &quot;calculate&quot; the headers and write them in somewhere so I can use them as input in other pipeline.</p>\n<p>I refuse to think I'm the first person who has had to deal with this scenario, so I was wondering if somebody has any idea to solve this.</p>\n<p>Doing this with plain Java is quite simple.... but with Apache Beam it's another story. I appreciate any help.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","spring-boot","gradle","jib"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1881220,"reputation":4005,"user_id":1701388,"display_name":"Chanseok Oh"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1669988582,"creation_date":1669988582,"answer_id":74656715,"question_id":74575239,"body_markdown":"Use double-quotes instead of single quotes for the `jib.to.image` string so that Gradle evaluates the variable.","title":"Invalid image reference registry when using jib to dockerize gradle project","body":"<p>Use double-quotes instead of single quotes for the <code>jib.to.image</code> string so that Gradle evaluates the variable.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":8105935,"reputation":19,"user_id":6107466,"display_name":"hounan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":713,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1669988582,"creation_date":1669391857,"question_id":74575239,"body_markdown":"I had a problem when dockerize the Gradle project.\r\nrunning ***gradle jib***\r\n\r\n* What went wrong:\r\nExecution failed for task &#39;:jib&#39;.\r\n&gt;

That&#39;s a symptom. The problem is, there is something wrong with your code—code that you still haven&#39;t showed to anybody. Knowing that it takes 45 threads to manifest the problem, and not 44 or 17 or 110 is not going to help anybody to figure out what you did wrong. We need to see the code. So, Now we know the order in which `OneShotTask` calls `mMap.put()` and `remove()`, but we still don&#39;t know what those methods do.

Because of this, I had to install on a completely different PC (different manufacturer and motherboard model).  Therefore I couldn't use my image backup to restore because I needed a Fresh install of Ubuntu 14.04 because of the difference in PC configuration.</p>\n\n<p>I am now close to having it rebuilt, having done a ton of copying from my non-image backups (rsync, etc.).  However, when I go into one of my IntelliJ Java projects that used to work fine, I am getting a <em>lot</em> of broken source and class path errors when I examine the project settings.  They are all gradle library paths.  I am currently using Gradle 4.3, which I confirmed using the sdkman list command (sdk list gradle).  Also, I am using version 172.4343.14 of the IntelliJ Gradle plug-in.
