And in order not to make the test too complex and neat, so I only expect to verify the last call on a certain method of a object instead verify something like order/noMoreInteractions/AtMostTimes and so on.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","soap","xml-parsing"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":16379943,"reputation":51,"user_id":11831221,"display_name":"robrides"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1584621350,"creation_date":1584621350,"answer_id":60757407,"question_id":60414545,"body_markdown":"Take a look at this post, looks like you need to add an element to your header specifying the QName and localPart.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/60399029/soap-call-fails-when-deployed-on-websphere-but-works-fine-on-tomcat","title":"java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: local part cannot be &quot;null&quot; when creating a QName","body":"<p>Take a look at this post, looks like you need to add an element to your header specifying the QName and localPart.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60399029/soap-call-fails-when-deployed-on-websphere-but-works-fine-on-tomcat\">SOAP call fails when deployed on websphere but works fine on tomcat</a></p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":7741604,"reputation":21,"user_id":6696676,"display_name":"Enrico"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1669804760,"creation_date":1669804760,"answer_id":74626373,"question_id":60414545,"body_markdown":"After whole hours in searching, I just wanted to share the Answer in this [thread][1] helped me with a Talend code migration - involving SOAP messages - from java8 to java11.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Used libraries\r\nimport java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;\r\nimport javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory;\r\nimport javax.xml.soap.SOAPBody;\r\nimport org.w3c.dom.Document;\r\nimport org.w3c.dom.Node;\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n// This is the node I want to replace: &quot;&lt;DataArea&gt;&lt;Contact/&gt;&lt;/DataArea&gt;&quot;\r\n// &lt;SOAP-ENV:Body&gt; &gt; SOAP Action (e.g. &lt;ns:GetContact&gt;) &gt; &lt;GetContactRequest&gt; &gt; &lt;DataArea&gt;\r\nSOAPBody soapBodyRequest = objSOAPMessage.getSOAPPart().getEnvelope().getBody();\r\nNode nodeDataArea = soapBodyRequest.getFirstChild().getFirstChild().getFirstChild(); \r\n\r\n// Build a valid Node object starting from a string e.g. &quot;&lt;Contact&gt; etc etc nested-etc &lt;/Contact&gt;&quot;\r\nDocumentBuilderFactory objDocumentBuilderFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\r\n\r\n// As per java11, this is essential.

Is there any way to create a multipart file or convert the file to Multipart file without losing data.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","caching"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2871901,"reputation":1,"user_id":2465051,"display_name":"Emmanuel Sitamon"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1669789453,"creation_date":1669789453,"answer_id":74623621,"question_id":74542354,"body_markdown":"To solve your problem , you need to read the line, you input.nextLine() instead of next().\r\nAlso you must create a second object of type scanner for the nextLine() method. \r\nSee Code below\r\n\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\t   \r\n       Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n       System.out.print(&quot;Enter cache blocks: &quot;);\r\n       int blockNum = in.nextInt();\r\n       System.out.print(&quot;Enter set associativity (1=direct mapped, 2=2-way, 4=4-way): &quot;);\r\n       int setAssoc = in.nextInt();\r\n       System.out.print(&quot;Enter replacement policy (FIFO or LRU): &quot;);\r\n       String replacementPolicy = in.next();\r\n       Simulate cache = new Simulate(blockNum, setAssoc, replacementPolicy);\r\n       System.out.println(&quot;Enter reference string:&quot;);\r\n       Scanner inRef = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n       String input = inRef.nextLine();\r\n       String[] references = input.trim().split(&quot; &quot;);\r\n       System.out.println(input);\r\n       int[] refs = new int[references.length];\r\n       for (int i = 0; i &lt; references.length; i++) {\r\n           refs[i] = Integer.parseInt(references[i]);\r\n       }\r\n       cache.simulate(refs);\r\n   }","title":"Cant get my Cache simulator to run correctly","body":"<p>To solve your problem , you need to read the line, you input.nextLine() instead of next().\nAlso you must create a second object of type scanner for the nextLine() method.\nSee Code below</p>\n<p>public static void main(String[] args) {</p>\n<pre><code>   Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);\n   System.out.print(&quot;Enter cache blocks: &quot;);\n   int blockNum = in.nextInt();\n   System.out.print(&quot;Enter set associativity (1=direct mapped, 2=2-way, 4=4-way): &quot;);\n   int setAssoc = in.nextInt();\n   System.out.print(&quot;Enter replacement policy (FIFO or LRU): &quot;);\n   String replacementPolicy = in.next();\n   Simulate cache = new Simulate(blockNum, setAssoc, replacementPolicy);\n   System.out.println(&quot;Enter reference string:&quot;);\n   Scanner inRef = new Scanner(System.in);\n   String input = inRef.nextLine();\n   String[] references = input.trim().split(&quot; &quot;);\n   System.out.println(input);\n   int[] refs = new int[references.length];\n   for (int i = 0; i &lt; references.length; i++) {\n       refs[i] = Integer.parseInt(references[i]);\n   }\n   cache.simulate(refs);\n</code></pre>\n<p>}</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":26528823,"reputation":1,"user_id":20161363,"display_name":"deadpanrobo"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":85,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1669789453,"creation_date":1669182995,"question_id":74542354,"body_markdown":"So I have been trying to get a program that will simulate how a LRU replacement policy on a simple cache but for some reason when I input the numbers im trying to enter into the reference string for the cache to implement, it only displays the first number entered and displays 0s after that.

Several Java versions were installed in my Window$ 10 PC at the same time (8, 17 and 19) and I had JRE and JDK. I supposed that they didn&#39;t interfere because they come from the same company (Oracle), but they did interfere.\r\nSo I went to Apps &amp; Features in Windows 10 Configuration section and uninstalled everything related to Java, which went smoothly. Then I reinstalled JRE so now I only have this Java version. UniCenta recognizes this Java without problems and now starts normally. After deleting 2 protocols to link with the DataBase, uniCenta loads now completely and normally.\r\nIf one wanted to develop Java with NetBeans (JDK) and at the same time install uniCenta oPOS (JRE) in the Windows PC, turns out that the JDK doesn&#39;t supersede correctly the JRE subset. Shame on Oracle.","title":"After installing NetBeans in Windows 10, I cannot run uniCenta oPOS which is a jar file (solved)","body":"<p>I had installed the Point of Sale program called: uniCenta oPOS, which requires the installation of jre.

Nothing works.\nWhen I tried to run the uniCenta jar in cmd window, it doesn't run either and produces the following report:</p>\n<pre><code>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\unicentaopos-4.6.1&gt;java -jar unicentaopos.jar\nSLF4J: Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings.\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/unicentaopos-4.6.1/lib/logback-classic-1.2.2.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/unicentaopos-4.6.1/lib/posapps-client-1.4.8-exe.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/unicentaopos-4.6.1/lib/weblaf-1.2.9.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/C:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/unicentaopos-4.6.1/lib/slf4j-simple-1.7.24.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\nSLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#multiple_bindings for an explanation.\nSLF4J: Actual binding is of type [ch.qos.logback.classic.util.ContextSelectorStaticBinder]\n08:22:20.214 | java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError\njava.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError: null\n        at com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream.setupConverters(XStream.java:807)\n        at com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream.&lt;init&gt;(XStream.java:574)\n        at com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream.&lt;init&gt;(XStream.java:496)\n        at com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream.&lt;init&gt;(XStream.java:465)\n        at com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream.&lt;init&gt;(XStream.java:411)\n        at com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream.&lt;init&gt;(XStream.java:378)\n        at com.alee.utils.XmlUtils.initializeXStream(XmlUtils.java:94)\n        at com.alee.utils.XmlUtils.getXStream(XmlUtils.java:81)\n        at com.alee.utils.XmlUtils.processAnnotations(XmlUtils.java:148)\n        at com.alee.managers.style.StyleManager.&lt;clinit&gt;(StyleManager.java:66)\n        at com.alee.laf.label.WebLabelUI.installUI(WebLabelUI.java:96)\n        at java.desktop/javax.swing.JComponent.setUI(JComponent.java:740)\n        at java.desktop/javax.swing.JLabel.setUI(JLabel.java:274)\n        at com.alee.laf.label.WebLabel.updateUI(WebLabel.java:466)\n        at java.desktop/javax.swing.JLabel.&lt;init&gt;(JLabel.java:180)\n        at java.desktop/javax.swing.JLabel.&lt;init&gt;(JLabel.java:251)\n        at com.alee.laf.label.WebLabel.&lt;init&gt;(WebLabel.java:65)\n        at com.alee.extended.statusbar.WebMemoryBar.&lt;init&gt;(WebMemoryBar.java:83)\n        at com.openbravo.pos.forms.JRootApp.initComponents(JRootApp.java:985)\n        at com.openbravo.pos.forms.JRootApp.&lt;init&gt;(JRootApp.java:195)\n        at com.openbravo.pos.forms.JRootFrame.initFrame(JRootFrame.java:70)\n        at com.openbravo.pos.forms.StartPOS.lambda$main$0(StartPOS.java:112)\n        at java.desktop/java.awt.event.InvocationEvent.dispatch(InvocationEvent.java:318)\n        at java.desktop/java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEventImpl(EventQueue.java:773)\n        at java.desktop/java.awt.EventQueue$4.run(EventQueue.java:720)\n        at java.desktop/java.awt.EventQueue$4.run(EventQueue.java:714)\n        at java.base/java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(AccessController.java:399)\n        at java.base/java.security.ProtectionDomain$JavaSecurityAccessImpl.doIntersectionPrivilege(ProtectionDomain.java:86)\n        at java.desktop/java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEvent(EventQueue.java:742)\n        at java.desktop/java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpOneEventForFilters(EventDispatchThread.java:203)\n        at java.desktop/java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForFilter(EventDispatchThread.java:124)\n        at java.desktop/java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEventsForHierarchy(EventDispatchThread.java:113)\n        at java.desktop/java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(EventDispatchThread.java:109)\n        at java.desktop/java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(EventDispatchThread.java:101)\n        at java.desktop/java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(EventDispatchThread.java:90)\nCaused by: java.lang.reflect.InaccessibleObjectException: Unable to make field private final java.util.Comparator java.util.TreeMap.comparator accessible: module java.base does not &quot;opens java.util&quot;

And it's an already installed and executable program, so errors make no sense.</p>\n<p>What could be the problem? Any ideas? Thanks.</p>\n<p>Solved: The solution was actually easy. Several Java versions were installed in my Window$ 10 PC at the same time (8, 17 and 19) and I had JRE and JDK. I supposed that they didn't interfere because they come from the same company (Oracle), but they did interfere.\nSo I went to Apps &amp; Features in Windows 10 Configuration section and uninstalled everything related to Java, which went smoothly. Then I reinstalled JRE so now I only have this Java version. UniCenta recognizes this Java without problems and now starts normally. After deleting 2 protocols to link with the DataBase, uniCenta loads now completely and normally.\nIf one wanted to develop Java with NetBeans (JDK) and at the same time install uniCenta oPOS (JRE) in the Windows PC, turns out that the JDK doesn't supersede correctly the JRE subset. Shame on Oracle.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","intellij-idea"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":5534380,"reputation":268,"user_id":4472711,"display_name":"MNEMO"},"score":0,"creation_date":1669777092,"post_id":74622082,"comment_id":131718214,"body_markdown":"bytecode version 61.0 is for class files compiled with jdk17 compiler, so maybe you could clean and rebuild whole project to resolve that.","body":"bytecode version 61.0 is for class files compiled with jdk17 compiler, so maybe you could clean and rebuild whole project to resolve that."},{"owner":{"account_id":47283,"reputation":703927,"user_id":139985,"accept_rate":69,"display_name":"Stephen C"},"score":1,"creation_date":1669778787,"post_id":74622082,"comment_id":131718440,"body_markdown":"What version of Spring are you using?
