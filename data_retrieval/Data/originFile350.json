I downloaded the JAR file of Nooj from the Nooj download page and added it as a dependency in my pom.xml file:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;com.nooj&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;nooj_api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;scope&gt;system&lt;/scope&gt;\n    &lt;systemPath&gt;${C:\\Program Files\\Java\\Java NooJ\\lib}&lt;/systemPath&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My goal is to use the Nooj class to load a text file and apply grammatical rules to it. Here is the code I wrote for that:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>import com.nooj.api.*;\n\npublic class TestNooj {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create an instance of Nooj\n        Nooj nooj = new Nooj();\n\n        // Load the text file\n        String input = &quot;C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\Documents\\\\test.txt&quot;;\n        nooj.loadText(input);\n\n        // Load the grammatical module\n        String grammar = &quot;C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Java\\\\Java NooJ\\\\lib\\\\grammars\\\\french.noz&quot;;\n        nooj.loadGrammar(grammar);\n\n        // Apply the grammatical rules to the text\n        nooj.applyGrammar();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However,when I import the classes of the Nooj API in my code (import com.nooj.api.*;), I get the following error message:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>java: package com.nooj.api does not exist\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I tried to use ProcessBuilder to run the Nooj JAR file as an external process, but I didn't manage to get the expected results.\nHow can I use ProcessBuilder or Nooj API in my Java project? What is the cause of the error message and how can I fix it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thank you in advance for your help</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","struts2"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1820003,"reputation":49625,"user_id":1654265,"accept_rate":93,"display_name":"Andrea Ligios"},"score":1,"creation_date":1416574836,"post_id":27060455,"comment_id":42638151,"body_markdown":"`&lt;html:bean/&gt;` is `&lt;s:bean&gt;`, and `&lt;html:select&gt;`/`&lt;html:option&gt;` is just `&lt;s:select&gt;`, and you probably will need only `&lt;s:select&gt;`, with no s:bean at all.","body":"<code>&lt;html:bean&#47;&gt;</code> is <code>&lt;s:bean&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;html:select&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;html:option&gt;</code> is just <code>&lt;s:select&gt;</code>, and you probably will need only <code>&lt;s:select&gt;</code>, with no s:bean at all."},{"owner":{"account_id":698222,"reputation":50202,"user_id":573032,"accept_rate":77,"display_name":"Roman C"},"score":0,"creation_date":1416660136,"post_id":27060455,"comment_id":42665377,"body_markdown":"@Rahul You shouldn&#39;t use all code from the snippet to find equivalents for every tag in Struts2.

Strictly speaking you can&#39;t have PKCS5 padding with AES, I&#39;m assuming it in fact will be the logical extension called PKCS7. So, up to 32 bytes of overhead per encryption session, or segment is normal. (You should be specifying PCKS7 as padding for AES).\r\n\r\nIt is not normal for it to increase to twice the size, you&#39;re doing something wrong in the code.\r\n\r\nAnd, no, it has no effect whatsoever on the output size what chunk size you read the input with - one byte or everything.

In other words, it is the time between receiving two packets of data.  \r\n  \r\nSuppose I have set the value of both the Timeouts as 3 seconds. So, ConnectTimeout occurs when establishing a connection takes longer than 3 seconds and ReadTimeout/SocketTimeout occurs when the client doesn&#39;t receive any data from the server(as part of API Request) for 3 seconds.  \r\n  \r\nI was assuming that this `ReadTimeout` can be used to timeout an HTTP Request made to the third-party API if it takes longer than N seconds to respond. But it looks like the meaning is different *it can take way beyond N seconds (or 3 seconds as in my case) if it serves data slowly but with breaks shorter than 3 seconds.* **Please confirm if this understanding is correct.**  \r\n  \r\nSo, why isn&#39;t there a direct property in spring boot or Apache HTTP Client which times out a REST API request if it takes longer than N seconds? What might be the negative consequences if such type of timeout is provided? There may be some limitations also. **I can think of one:** If the target API is a resource modifying (CREATE/UPDATE) one and if we time out the request, then the consumer gets an exception even if the resource is modified by the third-party API. However, if it is a Query call, then there is no issues.  \r\n  \r\n**Is using libraries like Resilience4j and Netflix Hystrix the only solution?
