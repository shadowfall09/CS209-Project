You can name it something like <code>eclipse-clean.bat</code> (or <code>eclipse-clean.sh</code>). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(From: <a href=\"http://www.eclipsezone.com/eclipse/forums/t61566.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.eclipsezone.com/eclipse/forums/t61566.html</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Other eclipse command line options: <a href=\"http://help.eclipse.org/indigo/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fmisc%2Fruntime-options.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://help.eclipse.org/indigo/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fmisc%2Fruntime-options.html</a></p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":27698,"reputation":36225,"user_id":73371,"accept_rate":93,"display_name":"Spike Williams"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":36,"is_accepted":false,"score":36,"last_activity_date":1262978530,"creation_date":1262978530,"answer_id":2030096,"question_id":2030064,"body_markdown":"You can start Eclipse in clean mode from the command line:\r\n\r\n    eclipse -clean","title":"How to run eclipse in clean mode? what happens if we do so?","body":"<p>You can start Eclipse in clean mode from the command line:</p>\n\n<pre><code>eclipse -clean\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":36858,"reputation":113744,"user_id":105224,"accept_rate":73,"display_name":"Andreas Dolk"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":85,"is_accepted":false,"score":84,"last_activity_date":1262978591,"creation_date":1262978591,"answer_id":2030106,"question_id":2030064,"body_markdown":"For clean mode: start the platform like\r\n\r\n    eclipse -clean\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s all.

You shouldn't rely on environment variables either because they can be modified by the user. Your application should call the <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb762188%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">SHGetKnownFolderPath</a> function of the Windows API.</p>\n\n<p>The difference between the two is that the local profile is specific to the user and the machine, while the roaming profile is specific to the user, so in a setup like my university, stuff apps put in the roaming profile are uploaded to the server and synced to whichever computer I log in to.</p>\n\n<p>It should be the responsibility of applications to choose whether the settings they want to store are local or roaming. Unfortunately Java does not allow apps to decide this.

All other players wait.</p>\n<pre><code>    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        while (!gameOver) {\n            try {\n                synchronized (team) {\n                    if (hasBall) {\n                        Player nextPlayer = team.getNextPlayer(playerId);\n                        nextPlayer.catchBall();\n                        hasBall = false;\n                        team.notifyAll();\n                    } else {\n                        team.wait();\n                    }\n                }\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                throw new RuntimeException(e);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>A Team is made up of players and the Team contains logic to determine who gets the ball next.</p>\n<pre><code>    public Player getNextPlayer(int currentPlayer) {\n        switch (currentDirection) {\n            case NEXT:\n                if ( currentPlayer &gt;= numPlayers) {\n                    currentDirection = DIRECTION.PRIOR;\n                }\n                break;\n            case PRIOR:\n                if ( currentPlayer &lt;= 1) {\n                    currentDirection = DIRECTION.NEXT;\n                }\n                break;\n        }\n        int nextPlayer = currentDirection == DIRECTION.NEXT ? currentPlayer + 1 : currentPlayer - 1;\n        return players.get(nextPlayer-1);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The rest is just housekeeping.</p>\n<pre><code>public class Player extends Thread {\n    private final Team team;\n    private final int playerId;\n    private boolean hasBall;\n    private boolean gameOver;\n\n    public Player(Team team, int playerId) {\n        this.team = team;\n        this.playerId = playerId;\n        this.hasBall = false;\n        this.gameOver = false;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        while (!gameOver) {\n            try {\n                synchronized (team) {\n                    if (hasBall) {\n                        Player nextPlayer = team.getNextPlayer(playerId);\n                        nextPlayer.catchBall();\n                        hasBall = false;\n                        team.notifyAll();\n                    } else {\n                        team.wait();\n                    }\n                }\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                throw new RuntimeException(e);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void catchBall() {\n        hasBall = true;\n        System.out.println(&quot;Ball caught by &quot; + playerId);\n    }\n\n    public void gameOver() {\n        gameOver = true;\n    }\n\n    public void printState() {\n        System.out.println(&quot;Player &quot; + playerId + (hasBall ? &quot; has ball.&quot; : &quot; does NOT have ball.&quot;));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>and</p>\n<pre><code>public class Team {\n    private final int numPlayers;\n    private final List&lt;Player&gt; players;\n    private enum DIRECTION {NEXT, PRIOR}\n    private DIRECTION currentDirection;\n\n    public Team(int numPlayers) {\n        this.numPlayers = numPlayers;\n        players = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(numPlayers);\n        currentDirection = DIRECTION.NEXT;\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numPlayers; ++i) {\n            players.add(new Player(this, i+1));\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void playCatch() {\n        players.forEach(Thread::start);\n        players.get(0).catchBall();\n        synchronized (this) {\n            notifyAll();\n        }\n    }\n    public void stopGame() {\n        players.forEach(Player::gameOver);\n        synchronized (this) {\n            notifyAll();\n        }\n        players.forEach(p-&gt; {\n            try {\n                p.join();\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                throw new RuntimeException(e);\n            }\n        });\n        players.forEach(Player::printState);\n    }\n    public Player getNextPlayer(int currentPlayer) {\n        switch (currentDirection) {\n            case NEXT:\n                if ( currentPlayer &gt;= numPlayers) {\n                    currentDirection = DIRECTION.PRIOR;\n                }\n                break;\n            case PRIOR:\n                if ( currentPlayer &lt;= 1) {\n                    currentDirection = DIRECTION.NEXT;\n                }\n                break;\n        }\n        int nextPlayer = currentDirection == DIRECTION.NEXT ? currentPlayer + 1 : currentPlayer - 1;\n        return players.get(nextPlayer-1);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The description of the problem solution reads equally well for both a layperson (product owner) and a technical person.

I find the larger of the strings and choose it to be the outer string to loop throught\r\n 2. `toCharArray()` converts the string into characters so you can loop through each characters in the string using Java&#39;s foreach (For more click[\\[1\\]][1])\r\n 3. Inside the loop you should exit on two conditions\r\n     * End of the string (I use length to find if I reach end of smaller string)\r\n     * no more matching characters between two strings\r\n 4. you increment the index until you break out in one of the above conditions\r\n 5. By the time you break out of the for loop, `index` will contain the last index where both string are continuously equal.\r\n 6. If index = 0. just say no matches else print characters from 0 until `index`\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2451650/how-do-i-apply-the-for-each-loop-to-every-character-in-a-string","title":"Find the longest common prefix of two strings","body":"<p>try this.
