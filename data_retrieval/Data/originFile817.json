Better designs, like Rust&#39;s modeled on GNU C inline asm can use registers.  e.g. like GNU C `asm(&quot;lzcnt %1, %0&quot; : &quot;=r&quot;(leading_zero_count) : &quot;rm&quot;(input));` letting the compiler pick an output register, and pick register or a memory addressing mode for the input.\r\n\r\n(But even better to **use intrinsics** like `_lzcnt_u32` or `__builtin_clz` for operations the compiler knows about, only inline asm for instructions the compiler doesn&#39;t have intrinsics for, or if you want to micro-optimize a loop in a certain way.  **https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DontUseInlineAsm**)\r\n\r\nSome (like Delphi) have inputs via a &quot;calling convention&quot; similar to a function call, with args in registers, not quite free mixing of asm and high-level code.  So it&#39;s more like an asm block with fixed inputs, and one output in a specific register (plus side-effects) which the compiler can inline like it would a function.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**For syntax like you show to work**, either\r\n\r\n* You have to manually save/restore every register you use *inside* the asm block (really bad for performance unless you&#39;re wrapping a big loop - apparently Borland Turbo C++ was like this)\r\n* **Or the compiler has to understand every single instruction to know what registers it might write** (MSVC is like this).  The design notes / discussion for Rust&#39;s inline asm mention this requirement for [D or MSVC compilers to implement what&#39;s effectively a DSL (Domain Specific Language)][2], and how much extra work that is, especially for portability to new ISAs.\r\n\r\nNote that MSVC&#39;s specific implementation of inline asm was so brittle and clunky that it [doesn&#39;t work safely in functions with register args][3], which meant not supporting it at all for x86-64, or ARM/AArch64 where the standard calling convention uses register args.  Instead, they provide intriniscs for basically every instruction, including privileged ones like `invlpg`, making it possible to write a kernel (such as Windows) in Visual C++.  (Where other compilers would expect you to use `asm()` for such things).  Windows almost certainly has a few parts written in separate .asm files, like interrupt and system-call entry points, and maybe a context-switch function that has to load a new stack pointer, but with good intrinsics support you don&#39;t *need* asm, if you trust your compiler to make good-enough asm on its own.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety\r\n  [2]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2873-inline-asm.html#implement-an-embedded-dsl\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3323445/what-is-the-difference-between-asm-asm-and-asm/35959859#comment59576185_35959859","title":"Assembly - Are there any languages other than C and C++ that allow for interaction with Assembly using inline code?","body":"<p>Yes, D, Rust, Delphi, and quite a few other <strong>ahead-of-time-compiled languages</strong> have some form of inline asm.</p>\n<p>Java doesn't, nor do most other languages that are normally JIT-compiled from a portable binary (like Java's .class bytecode, or C#'s CIL).  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11632078/code-injecting-assembly-inlining-in-java\">Code injecting/assembly inlining in Java?</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Memory-safe</a> languages like Rust only allow inline asm in <code>unsafe{}</code> blocks because assembly language can mess up the program state in arbitrary ways if it's buggy, even more broadly than C undefined behaviour.

So it's more like an asm block with fixed inputs, and one output in a specific register (plus side-effects) which the compiler can inline like it would a function.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>For syntax like you show to work</strong>, either</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have to manually save/restore every register you use <em>inside</em> the asm block (really bad for performance unless you're wrapping a big loop - apparently Borland Turbo C++ was like this)</li>\n<li><strong>Or the compiler has to understand every single instruction to know what registers it might write</strong> (MSVC is like this).  The design notes / discussion for Rust's inline asm mention this requirement for <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2873-inline-asm.html#implement-an-embedded-dsl\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">D or MSVC compilers to implement what's effectively a DSL (Domain Specific Language)</a>, and how much extra work that is, especially for portability to new ISAs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that MSVC's specific implementation of inline asm was so brittle and clunky that it <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3323445/what-is-the-difference-between-asm-asm-and-asm/35959859#comment59576185_35959859\">doesn't work safely in functions with register args</a>, which meant not supporting it at all for x86-64, or ARM/AArch64 where the standard calling convention uses register args.  Instead, they provide intriniscs for basically every instruction, including privileged ones like <code>invlpg</code>, making it possible to write a kernel (such as Windows) in Visual C++.  (Where other compilers would expect you to use <code>asm()</code> for such things).  Windows almost certainly has a few parts written in separate .asm files, like interrupt and system-call entry points, and maybe a context-switch function that has to load a new stack pointer, but with good intrinsics support you don't <em>need</em> asm, if you trust your compiler to make good-enough asm on its own.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":20174144,"reputation":67,"user_id":14796242,"display_name":"thedudehimself"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1621371157,"creation_date":1621371157,"answer_id":67593794,"question_id":67592482,"body_markdown":"You can inline assembly in HolyC.","title":"Assembly - Are there any languages other than C and C++ that allow for interaction with Assembly using inline code?","body":"<p>You can inline assembly in HolyC.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":8157618,"reputation":163,"user_id":6226536,"accept_rate":57,"display_name":"Leon Horka"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":888,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":67592688,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1670786940,"creation_date":1621364630,"question_id":67592482,"body_markdown":"I recently read this document titled [Embedded Systems/Mixed C and Assembly Programming][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Embedded_Systems/Mixed_C_and_Assembly_Programming\r\nIt basically deals with how C and C++ allow the user to use Assembly code via a technique called *inline assembly* that looks sort of like this:\r\n\r\n    #include&lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n     \r\n    void main() {\r\n     \r\n       int a = 3, b = 3, c;\r\n     \r\n       asm {\r\n          mov ax,a\r\n          mov bx,b\r\n          add ax,bx\r\n          mov c,ax\r\n       }\r\n     \r\n       printf(&quot;%d&quot;, c);\r\n    }\r\nAnd I was wondering if a similar interaction was possible in other high-level languages like Java, Python and others, or if this was only possible with C and C++.

I first implemented this serially like this: \r\n```\r\n    private Set&lt;ReversiState&gt; getChildrenSerial() {\r\n\r\n        HashSet&lt;ReversiState&gt; childrenSet = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n        // For each piece of the player, add the children.\r\n        for(int row=0; row&lt;BOARD_SIZE; row++){\r\n            for(int col=0; col&lt;BOARD_SIZE; col++){\r\n\r\n                // This is where the heavy work happens\r\n                addChildrenForPosition(childrenSet, row, col);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return childrenSet;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run my program using this, it finishes in around 9.7 seconds. The minimax algorithm that uses this method can on average search for a depth of 7.0 nodes. \r\n\r\nHowever, I wanted to be able to search deeper, as that is more desirable for the outcome I want. To do that, I tried to use Java&#39;s `ThreadPoolExecutor` as a static final in the same class. But got worse results. \r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate static final int NB_THREADS = 8;\r\nprivate static final ThreadPoolExecutor executor = (ThreadPoolExecutor) \r\n    Executors.newFixedThreadPool(NB_THREADS);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd implemented the `getChildrenParallel` method.

I first implemented this serially like this:</p>\n<pre><code>    private Set&lt;ReversiState&gt; getChildrenSerial() {\n\n        HashSet&lt;ReversiState&gt; childrenSet = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\n\n        // For each piece of the player, add the children.\n        for(int row=0; row&lt;BOARD_SIZE; row++){\n            for(int col=0; col&lt;BOARD_SIZE; col++){\n\n                // This is where the heavy work happens\n                addChildrenForPosition(childrenSet, row, col);\n            }\n        }\n\n        return childrenSet;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I run my program using this, it finishes in around 9.7 seconds. The minimax algorithm that uses this method can on average search for a depth of 7.0 nodes.</p>\n<p>However, I wanted to be able to search deeper, as that is more desirable for the outcome I want. To do that, I tried to use Java's <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> as a static final in the same class. But got worse results.</p>\n<pre><code>private static final int NB_THREADS = 8;\nprivate static final ThreadPoolExecutor executor = (ThreadPoolExecutor) \n    Executors.newFixedThreadPool(NB_THREADS);\n</code></pre>\n<p>And implemented the <code>getChildrenParallel</code> method.

The same object/memory address means that when I update variable $a, $b also needs to be updated and vice versa because $a and $b are referring to the same thing. </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","mysql","netbeans","h2","hibernate3"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":468855,"reputation":5925,"user_id":875083,"display_name":"Joachim Rohde"},"score":0,"creation_date":1421748235,"post_id":28039438,"comment_id":44468016,"body_markdown":"Aren&#39;t you missing (at least) a username for your connection?","body":"Aren&#39;t you missing (at least) a username for your connection?"},{"owner":{"account_id":3456301,"reputation":1630,"user_id":2894742,"accept_rate":63,"display_name":"Selva"},"score":0,"creation_date":1421748497,"post_id":28039438,"comment_id":44468188,"body_markdown":"@Joachim,I execute the queries without using hibernate that works for me.but i cannot able to perform that in hibernate","body":"@Joachim,I execute the queries without using hibernate that works for me.but i cannot able to perform that in hibernate"},{"owner":{"account_id":468855,"reputation":5925,"user_id":875083,"display_name":"Joachim Rohde"},"score":0,"creation_date":1421748990,"post_id":28039438,"comment_id":44468498,"body_markdown":"Having a quick glance at the official site (http://www.h2database.com/html/cheatSheet.html): does it work if you specify the dialect:\n &lt;property name=&quot;dialect&quot;&gt;\n    org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect\n&lt;/property&gt;\n?","body":"Having a quick glance at the official site (<a href=\"http://www.h2database.com/html/cheatSheet.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">h2database.com/html/cheatSheet.html</a>): does it work if you specify the dialect:  &lt;property name=&quot;dialect&quot;&gt;     org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect &lt;/property&gt; ?"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":8857252,"reputation":1,"user_id":6614622,"display_name":"Manali Patel"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1469882574,"creation_date":1469882574,"answer_id":38674096,"question_id":28039438,"body_markdown":"hey i was having the same issue, so i just right clicked the default package under the source package of the particular project in netbeans and then made the reverse engineering file...netbeans is then successfully creating the hibernate.reveng.xml file ","title":"nebeans does not create reverse engineering files for h2","body":"<p>hey i was having the same issue, so i just right clicked the default package under the source package of the particular project in netbeans and then made the reverse engineering file...netbeans is then successfully creating the hibernate.reveng.xml file </p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2098890,"reputation":353,"user_id":1867046,"display_name":"Noby Nirmal"},"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1670766719,"creation_date":1489953361,"answer_id":42891508,"question_id":28039438,"body_markdown":"You must start MySQL service and then connect to MySQL.

The combination you did there is not possible in java. You could have something like \r\n\r\n    if (rowSeat != arr1[rowSeat][colmnSeat]\r\n        ||&#160;colmnSeat != arr1[rowSeat][colmnSeat]) {\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nbut that wouldn&#39;t help you. This statement would check if the value in your array is not equal to the users selected row or the column.\r\n\r\n**Solutions:**\r\n\r\nYou have two options:\r\n\r\n 1. you do a manual index check or\r\n 2. you let handle java the index check.\r\n\r\n\r\n**1. The manual index check:**\r\n\r\nFirst, you need to check the user input **before** you assign the value for `arr1`. So your if-statement needs to happen right after `colmnSeat = userNum.nextInt();`.\r\n\r\nYou need to do the following:\r\n\r\n    if (rowSeat &lt; 0 ||&#160;rowSeat &gt;= arr1.length\r\n        || colmnSeat &lt; 0 || colmnSeat &gt;= arr1[0].length) {\r\n        throw new ArrayInputMismatchException(&quot;Something ....&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n**Further explanation**\r\n\r\nFirst of all, arrays start at 0. So, given an array of 4, the first element has the index 0 and the last element has the index 3 (not 4!). If you would try to access arr[4], you would get an error (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException) and your program stops.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why we need to check for negative input. Secondly we need to check, if the values are greater or equal to the size of the array.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst it checks if the values are negative and then it checks, if the values are out of bound. The 2D-array is actually an array of arrays of this structure:\r\n\r\n    arr1 = [[row1-col1, row1-col2]]\r\n           [[row2-col1, row2-col2]]\r\n           [[row3-col1, row3-col2]]\r\n\r\nwherein row1-col1 is the value of `arr1[0,0]`. In this structure, the outer array holds the arrays with the values. So when only calling the outer array, you get the array for one row:\r\n\r\n    arr1[0] == [row1-col1, row1-col2]\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s how these values come about:\r\n\r\n    arr1.length    == 3\r\n    arr1[0].length == 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**2. Letting java handle the check:**\r\n\r\nWhenever you try to access a value from an array with an index that doesn&#39;t exist for the array (either too big or to low), java throws the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. We can take leverage of this fact and catch this error in a second catch block, which can be appended to your code in the following manner:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    } \r\n    catch (InputMismatchException e) {\r\n      System.out.println(&quot;\\nAn error occured: You cannot enter any character or symbol other than a valid number for the row and column of the chosen seat for booking. &quot; + e); \r\n    } //...\r\n    catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {\r\n      System.out.println(&quot;your other error message&quot;);\r\n      // or....\r\n      throw new ArrayInputMismatchException(&quot;your message&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"How to verify if User Input is equivalent to my element in 2D array","body":"<h3>TLDR;</h3>\n<p>Two possible solutions (there can be more).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Manual index check</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>if (rowSeat &lt; 0 || rowSeat &gt;= arr1.length\n    || colmnSeat &lt; 0 || colmnSeat &gt;= arr1[0].length) {\n    throw new ArrayInputMismatchException(&quot;Something ....&quot;);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Catching the thrown exception:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>...\n} \ncatch (InputMismatchException e) {\n  System.out.println(&quot;\\nAn error occured: You cannot enter any character or symbol other than a valid number for the row and column of the chosen seat for booking. &quot; + e); \n} //...\ncatch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {\n  System.out.println(&quot;your other error message&quot;);\n  // or....\n  throw new ArrayInputMismatchException(&quot;your message&quot;);\n}\n...\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Further explanation</h3>\n<p>The if-statement you wrote won't compile.
