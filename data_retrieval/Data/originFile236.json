Is the documentation talking again about the case where the acquiring thread is not parked?</p>\n<p>My currently understanding is as following: as long as the acquiring thread is not <em>parked</em>, strategies other than FIFO are possible. In case the acquiring thread must be <em>parked</em>, FIFO will be used.</p>\n<p>Do you agree with my statements or am I getting something wrong? Does it make sense to open a BUG for Oracle to fix it?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","backend","spring-webflux","javabeans"],"owner":{"account_id":19503664,"reputation":1,"user_id":14269144,"display_name":"Pradeep"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1692643772,"creation_date":1692643772,"question_id":76947999,"body_markdown":"I am getting error like given below i have used annocations like component scan and also I have specfied the annocations properly this is a instance of another big project\r\nI have done the configuration file also i tried the solutions of stackoverflow but still the problem is not solved\r\n\r\n***************************\r\nAPPLICATION FAILED TO START\r\n***************************\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nField s1Repo in com.example.backend.s2.S2 required a bean of type &#39;com.example.backend.s1.S1Repo&#39;

These commands can be run from any directory, meaning you don&#39;t have to be in the directory where your HelloWorld.java file is.\r\n 2. The first line compiles your HelloWorld.java file, creating a HelloWorld.class file.  \r\n 3. The second line runs the HelloWorld.class file.\r\n 4. The -classpath tells java where to look for the specified file in each command\r\n 5. The Java compiler (javac.exe) expects the location of the java file, relative to the classpath (ie the file is located at C:\\Users\\Scott\\workspace\\myproject\\com\\mycompany\\myapp\\HelloWorld.java)\r\n 6. Java (java.exe) expects the package (ie com.mycompany.myapp) and class (HelloWorld), relative to the classpath (ie the file is located at C:\\Users\\Scott\\workspace\\myproject\\com\\mycompany\\myapp\\HelloWorld.class)\r\n\r\nNotice the classpath has no slash at the end.  The javac.exe commands expects the file to end with &quot;.java&quot;.  The java.exe command expects the full class name and does not end with &quot;.class&quot;.\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways to simplify these commands:\r\n\r\n 1. You don&#39;t have to specify the entire path to java.exe.  Add Java to the Windows Path (Run-&gt;sysdm.cpl-&gt;Advanced Tab-&gt;Environment Variables-&gt;Select Path-&gt;Edit-&gt;Append &quot;;C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.6.0_18\\bin\\&quot;).

Rearrange <code>nums</code> such that the following conditions are satisfied:</p>\n<p>Every element less than <code>pivot</code> appears before every element greater than <code>pivot</code>.</p>\n<p>Every element equal to <code>pivot</code> appears in between the elements less than and greater than <code>pivot</code>.</p>\n<p>The relative order of the elements less than <code>pivot</code> and the elements greater than <code>pivot</code> is maintained.</p>\n<p>More formally, consider every <code>pi</code>, <code>pj</code> where <code>pi</code> is the new position of the <code>i</code>th element and <code>pj</code> is the new position of the <code>jth</code> element. For elements less than pivot, if <code>i &lt; j</code> and <code>nums[i] &lt; pivot</code> and <code>nums[j] &lt; pivot</code>, then <code>pi &lt; pj</code>. Similarly for elements greater than <code>pivot</code>, if <code>i &lt; j</code> and <code>nums[i] &gt; pivot</code> and <code>nums[j] &gt; pivot</code>, then <code>pi &lt; pj</code>.</p>\n<p>Return <code>nums</code> after the rearrangement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Input: <code>nums = [9,12,5,10,14,3,10]</code>, <code>pivot = 10</code></p>\n<p>Output: <code>[9,5,3,10,10,12,14]</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>My solution:</strong></p>\n<p>A solution with <code>O(n)</code> memory is trivial. I tried to come up with a <code>O(1)</code> memory solution and approached a similar to insertion sort way:</p>\n<pre><code>public int[] pivotArray(int[] nums, int pivot) {\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; nums.length; i++){\n        if(nums[i] &lt; pivot){\n            for(int j = i; j &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; nums[j - 1] &gt;= pivot; j--){\n                int tmp = nums[j];\n                nums[j] = nums[j - 1];\n                nums[j - 1] = tmp;\n            }\n        }\n        if(nums[i] == pivot){\n            for(int j = i; j &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; nums[j - 1] &gt; pivot; j--){\n                int tmp = nums[j];\n                nums[j] = nums[j - 1];\n                nums[j - 1] = tmp;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return nums;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The issue is the solution has <code>O(n^2)</code> time complexity. Is there an algorithm to solve this faster than <code>O(n^2)</code>? I'm not sure if <code>O(n)</code> time and <code>O(1)</code> space complexity is possible though.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","csv"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":5404,"reputation":22100,"user_id":8681,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"Jorn"},"score":7,"creation_date":1692626072,"post_id":76945953,"comment_id":135645304,"body_markdown":"It&#39;s explained in [the javadoc](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/apidocs/org/apache/commons/csv/CSVFormat.html#withDelimiter-char-).

Configure Jackson (using HibernateAnnotationIntrospector&#39;s [setUseTransient][4] method) to disable the check for `@Transient` annotations (see [this answer][5] for implementation details).\r\n 2.
