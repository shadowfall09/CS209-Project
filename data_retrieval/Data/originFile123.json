Wikipedia has a pretty good summary of what [JavaBeans][2] are:\r\n\r\n&gt; JavaBeans are reusable software components for Java that can be manipulated visually in a builder tool. Practically, they are classes written in the Java programming language conforming to a particular convention. They are used to encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean), so that they can be passed around as a single bean object instead of as multiple individual objects. A JavaBean is a Java Object that is serializable, has a nullary constructor, and allows access to properties using getter and setter methods.\r\n\r\n&gt; In order to function as a JavaBean class, an object class must obey certain conventions about method naming, construction, and behavior. These conventions make it possible to have tools that can use, reuse, replace, and connect JavaBeans.\r\n\r\n&gt; The required conventions are:\r\n\r\n&gt; * The class must have a public default constructor. This allows easy instantiation within editing and activation frameworks.\r\n&gt; * The class properties must be accessible using get, set, and other methods (so-called accessor methods and mutator methods), following a standard naming convention. This allows easy automated inspection and updating of bean state within frameworks, many of which include custom editors for various types of properties.\r\n&gt; * The class should be serializable. This allows applications and frameworks to reliably save, store, and restore the bean&#39;s state in a fashion that is independent of the VM and platform.\r\n\r\n&gt; Because these requirements are largely expressed as conventions rather than by implementing interfaces, some developers view JavaBeans as Plain Old Java Objects that follow specific naming conventions.\r\n\r\nPOJO\r\n----\r\n\r\nA Plain Old Java Object or POJO is a term initially introduced to designate a simple lightweight Java object, not implementing any `javax.ejb` interface, as opposed to heavyweight EJB 2.x (especially Entity Beans, Stateless Session Beans are not that bad IMO). Today, the term is used for any simple object with no extra stuff. Again, Wikipedia does a good job at defining [POJO][3]:\r\n\r\n&gt; POJO is an acronym for Plain Old Java\r\n&gt; Object. The name is used to emphasize\r\n&gt; that the object in question is an\r\n&gt; ordinary Java Object, not a special\r\n&gt; object, and in particular not an\r\n&gt; Enterprise JavaBean (especially before\r\n&gt; EJB 3). The term was coined by Martin\r\n&gt; Fowler, Rebecca Parsons and Josh\r\n&gt; MacKenzie in September 2000:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; &gt; *&quot;We wondered why people were so against using regular objects in their\r\n&gt; systems and concluded that it was\r\n&gt; because simple objects lacked a fancy\r\n&gt; name. So we gave them one, and it&#39;s\r\n&gt; caught on very nicely.&quot;*\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The term continues the pattern of\r\n&gt; older terms for technologies that do\r\n&gt; not use fancy new features, such as\r\n&gt; POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) in\r\n&gt; telephony, and PODS (Plain Old Data\r\n&gt; Structures) that are defined in C++\r\n&gt; but use only C language features, and\r\n&gt; POD (Plain Old Documentation) in Perl.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The term has most likely gained\r\n&gt; widespread acceptance because of the\r\n&gt; need for a common and easily\r\n&gt; understood term that contrasts with\r\n&gt; complicated object frameworks. A\r\n&gt; JavaBean is a POJO that is\r\n&gt; serializable, has a no-argument\r\n&gt; constructor, and allows access to\r\n&gt; properties using getter and setter\r\n&gt; methods. An Enterprise JavaBean is not\r\n&gt; a single class but an entire component\r\n&gt; model (again, EJB 3 reduces the\r\n&gt; complexity of Enterprise JavaBeans).\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; As designs using POJOs have become\r\n&gt; more commonly-used, systems have\r\n&gt; arisen that give POJOs some of the\r\n&gt; functionality used in frameworks and\r\n&gt; more choice about which areas of\r\n&gt; functionality are actually needed.\r\n&gt; Hibernate and Spring are examples.\r\n\r\nValue Object\r\n------------\r\n\r\nA Value Object or VO is an object such as `java.lang.Integer` that hold values (hence value objects). For a more formal definition, I often refer to Martin Fowler&#39;s description of [Value Object][4]:\r\n\r\n&gt; In Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture I described Value Object as a small object such as a Money or date range object. Their key property is that they follow value semantics rather than reference semantics.\r\n\r\n&gt; You can usually tell them because their notion of equality isn&#39;t based on identity, instead two value objects are equal if all their fields are equal. Although all fields are equal, you don&#39;t need to compare all fields if a subset is unique - for example currency codes for currency objects are enough to test equality.\r\n\r\n&gt; A general heuristic is that value objects should be entirely immutable. If you want to change a value object you should replace the object with a new one and not be allowed to update the values of the value object itself - updatable value objects lead to aliasing problems.\r\n\r\n&gt; Early J2EE literature used the term value object to describe a different notion, what I call a [Data Transfer Object][5]. They have since changed their usage and use the term [Transfer Object][6] instead.\r\n\r\n&gt; You can find some more good material on value objects on the [wiki][7]  and by [Dirk Riehle][8].\r\n\r\nData Transfer Object\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nData Transfer Object or DTO is a (anti) pattern introduced with EJB. Instead of performing many remote calls on EJBs, the idea was to encapsulate data in a value object that could be transfered over the network: a Data Transfer Object. Wikipedia has a decent definition of [Data Transfer Object][9]:\r\n\r\n&gt; Data transfer object (DTO), formerly known as value objects or VO, is a design pattern used to transfer data between software application subsystems. DTOs are often used in conjunction with data access objects to retrieve data from a database.\r\n\r\n&gt; The difference between data transfer objects and business objects or data access objects is that a DTO does not have any behaviour except for storage and retrieval of its own data (accessors and mutators).\r\n\r\n&gt; In a traditional EJB architecture, DTOs serve dual purposes: first, they work around the problem that entity beans are not serializable; second, they implicitly define an assembly phase where all data to be used by the view is fetched and marshalled into the DTOs before returning control to the presentation tier.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSo, for many people, DTOs and VOs are the same thing (but Fowler uses VOs to mean something else as we saw). Most of time, they follow the JavaBeans conventions and are thus JavaBeans too. And all are POJOs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/spec-136004.html\r\n  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBean\r\n  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Java_Object\r\n  [4]: http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html\r\n  [5]: http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataTransferObject.html\r\n  [6]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/transferobject-139870.html\r\n  [7]: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ValueObject\r\n  [8]: http://www.riehle.org/computer-science/research/1998/ubilab-tr-1998-10-1.html\r\n  [9]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Transfer_Object","title":"Difference between DTO, VO, POJO, JavaBeans?","body":"<h2>JavaBeans</h2>\n\n<p>A JavaBean is a class that follows <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/spec-136004.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the JavaBeans conventions</a> as defined by Sun.

An Enterprise JavaBean is not\n  a single class but an entire component\n  model (again, EJB 3 reduces the\n  complexity of Enterprise JavaBeans).</p>\n  \n  <p>As designs using POJOs have become\n  more commonly-used, systems have\n  arisen that give POJOs some of the\n  functionality used in frameworks and\n  more choice about which areas of\n  functionality are actually needed.\n  Hibernate and Spring are examples.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Value Object</h2>\n\n<p>A Value Object or VO is an object such as <code>java.lang.Integer</code> that hold values (hence value objects). For a more formal definition, I often refer to Martin Fowler's description of <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Value Object</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture I described Value Object as a small object such as a Money or date range object. Their key property is that they follow value semantics rather than reference semantics.</p>\n  \n  <p>You can usually tell them because their notion of equality isn't based on identity, instead two value objects are equal if all their fields are equal. Although all fields are equal, you don't need to compare all fields if a subset is unique - for example currency codes for currency objects are enough to test equality.</p>\n  \n  <p>A general heuristic is that value objects should be entirely immutable. If you want to change a value object you should replace the object with a new one and not be allowed to update the values of the value object itself - updatable value objects lead to aliasing problems.</p>\n  \n  <p>Early J2EE literature used the term value object to describe a different notion, what I call a <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataTransferObject.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Data Transfer Object</a>. They have since changed their usage and use the term <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/transferobject-139870.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Transfer Object</a> instead.</p>\n  \n  <p>You can find some more good material on value objects on the <a href=\"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ValueObject\" rel=\"noreferrer\">wiki</a>  and by <a href=\"http://www.riehle.org/computer-science/research/1998/ubilab-tr-1998-10-1.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dirk Riehle</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Data Transfer Object</h2>\n\n<p>Data Transfer Object or DTO is a (anti) pattern introduced with EJB. Instead of performing many remote calls on EJBs, the idea was to encapsulate data in a value object that could be transfered over the network: a Data Transfer Object. Wikipedia has a decent definition of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Transfer_Object\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Data Transfer Object</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Data transfer object (DTO), formerly known as value objects or VO, is a design pattern used to transfer data between software application subsystems. DTOs are often used in conjunction with data access objects to retrieve data from a database.</p>\n  \n  <p>The difference between data transfer objects and business objects or data access objects is that a DTO does not have any behaviour except for storage and retrieval of its own data (accessors and mutators).</p>\n  \n  <p>In a traditional EJB architecture, DTOs serve dual purposes: first, they work around the problem that entity beans are not serializable; second, they implicitly define an assembly phase where all data to be used by the view is fetched and marshalled into the DTOs before returning control to the presentation tier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So, for many people, DTOs and VOs are the same thing (but Fowler uses VOs to mean something else as we saw). Most of time, they follow the JavaBeans conventions and are thus JavaBeans too. And all are POJOs.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2705291,"reputation":931,"user_id":2335016,"accept_rate":40,"display_name":"Olcay Tarazan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":67,"is_accepted":false,"score":66,"last_activity_date":1373882819,"creation_date":1373881756,"answer_id":17651305,"question_id":1612334,"body_markdown":"Basically,\r\n\r\nDTO: &quot;Data transfer objects &quot; can travel between seperate layers in software architecture.\r\n\r\nVO: &quot;Value objects &quot; hold a object such as Integer,Money etc.\r\n\r\nPOJO: Plain Old Java Object which is not a special object.\r\n\r\nJava Beans: requires a `Java Class` to be serializable, have a `no-arg` constructor and a getter and setter for each field","title":"Difference between DTO, VO, POJO, JavaBeans?","body":"<p>Basically,</p>\n\n<p>DTO: \"Data transfer objects \" can travel between seperate layers in software architecture.</p>\n\n<p>VO: \"Value objects \" hold a object such as Integer,Money etc.</p>\n\n<p>POJO: Plain Old Java Object which is not a special object.</p>\n\n<p>Java Beans: requires a <code>Java Class</code> to be serializable, have a <code>no-arg</code> constructor and a getter and setter for each field</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1352612,"reputation":4119,"user_id":1357094,"accept_rate":85,"display_name":"cellepo"},"score":0,"creation_date":1589651882,"post_id":38988421,"comment_id":109380836,"body_markdown":"What about VO, as the Question asked?

That means for every iteration of the inner `for` loop, you should only be printing out _one_ step. But the above will print _two_ steps for every non-empty step. That behavior comes from:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nSystem.out.print(&quot;|&lt;3|&quot;);\r\nSystem.out.print(&quot;|##|&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code needs to be modified so that only `|&lt;3|` **or** `|##|` is printed, not both at the same time.\r\n\r\nLooking at the expected output, we can see that the &quot;steps&quot; alternate both in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction. In the code, we have access to `x` and `y`. These two numbers are also alternating between even and odd. And if we look at the values of `x` and `y` for each step we&#39;ll see a pattern. A `|&lt;3|` will only be printed when `x` is _odd_ and `y` is _even_, or vice versa&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, a `|&lt;3|` will only be printed when `x` and `y` have _different [parity][2]_.\r\n\r\nUsing that knowledge, we can modify the original code to give us&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Main {\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        int numberOfSteps = 8;\r\n        for (int y = 1; y &lt;= numberOfSteps; y++) {\r\n            for (int x = 1; x &lt;= numberOfSteps; x++) {\r\n                if (x &gt; numberOfSteps - y) {\r\n                    if (x % 2 != y % 2) {\r\n                        System.out.print(&quot;|&lt;3|&quot;);\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        System.out.print(&quot;|##|&quot;);\r\n                    }\r\n                } else {\r\n                    System.out.print(&quot;|  |&quot;);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            System.out.println();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich now gives us the expected output:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||&lt;3|\r\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||&lt;3||##|\r\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||&lt;3||##||&lt;3|\r\n|  ||  ||  ||  ||&lt;3||##||&lt;3||##|\r\n|  ||  ||  ||&lt;3||##||&lt;3||##||&lt;3|\r\n|  ||  ||&lt;3||##||&lt;3||##||&lt;3||##|\r\n|  ||&lt;3||##||&lt;3||##||&lt;3||##||&lt;3|\r\n|&lt;3||##||&lt;3||##||&lt;3||##||&lt;3||##|\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1.
