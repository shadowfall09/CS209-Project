A set can be modelled as an array in the actual implementation, this does not mean anything. In programming challenges it is quite often that people use rather simple structures - like an array instead of `java.util.Set`.\r\n\r\nSo the task is basically:\r\n\r\n&gt; Randomly select a set of `M` elements from an array of size `N`.\r\n\r\nAssuming `N &gt;= M`.\r\n\r\nNow the hard part: why does this algorithm produce the correct results?\r\n\r\nJust looking at the algorithm, it&#39;s hard to understand how it works and why. I think this is because the algorithm is actually constructed recursively, with recursion finall unwrapped in iteration.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s start with the recursion.\r\n\r\nAssume we are able to randomly select `M` elements from an array of size `N - 1`.  How do we select `M` elements from an array of size `N`?\r\n\r\nSince there&#39;s a &quot;new&quot; element in the array, we can either replace one of the selected elements with it - or leave the set as it is. But we have to keep random properties.\r\n\r\nA set of `M` elements from `N-1` can be selected in `(N-1)! / M!*(N-1 - M)!` ways.  \r\nA set of `M` elements from `N` can be selected in `N! / M!*(N - M)!` ways.\r\n\r\nThis means that we should keep the set with the `(N-M)/N` probability and replace one of the elements with `M/N` probability. We will also have to select the element to replace with `1/M` probability.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s see how it will look in the code. Assume `subset` is our randomly selected set of `M` elements out of `N-1`.\r\n\r\nFirst we should decide if we replace one of the elements or not. We need a `(N-M)/N` probability. For this we can just generate a random number between `0` and `N`. If this number is less than `M`, we replace.\r\n\r\n    boolean replace = rand(random, 0, N) &lt; M;\r\n    if (replace) {\r\n       // then replace\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow we have to select one of the elements to replace. Since we model the array as a set, we can simply randomly select an index between `0` and `M - 1` (inclusive). So we get:\r\n\r\n    boolean replace = rand(random, 0, N) &lt; M;\r\n    if (replace) {\r\n       subset[rand(random, 0, M - 1)] = original[N];\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere we can note that if our first random value (`rand(random, 0, N)`) is less than `M`, it *is* a random value between `0` and `M-1`. Thus, we don&#39;t need the second `rand`:\r\n\r\n    int r = rand(random, 0, N);\r\n    boolean replace = r &lt; M;\r\n    if (replace) {\r\n       subset[r] = original[N];\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe rest should be pretty trivial.\r\n\r\nBase case of the recursion is `M == N`. In this case we don&#39;t replace anything so the set of selected elements is simple the original array.\r\n\r\nAfter that the recursion can be simply coded as a cycle. `i` represents `N` on each step - this gives your the code your have.","title":"Generate a set of M elements from an array of size N","body":"<p>First of all, it is quite clear from the explanation and the code that the author meant set, just as they wrote. A set can be modelled as an array in the actual implementation, this does not mean anything. In programming challenges it is quite often that people use rather simple structures - like an array instead of <code>java.util.Set</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So the task is basically:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Randomly select a set of <code>M</code> elements from an array of size <code>N</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Assuming <code>N &gt;= M</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now the hard part: why does this algorithm produce the correct results?</p>\n\n<p>Just looking at the algorithm, it's hard to understand how it works and why.

We will also have to select the element to replace with <code>1/M</code> probability.</p>\n\n<p>Let's see how it will look in the code. Assume <code>subset</code> is our randomly selected set of <code>M</code> elements out of <code>N-1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>First we should decide if we replace one of the elements or not.

The name of the internal variable used to hold the property value, in your example, `RegionName`, doesn&#39;t actually matter. By convention in Java you will use always camel case syntax for property names, with the first letter being lowercase, not uppercase such as in C#.\r\n\r\nAs described, the use of the stateful session is not related to the problem.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that, as pointed out by @RoddyoftheFrozenPeas in his comment, you could let Drools trying finding the different rules defined in your classpath.

some audio.&lt;br&gt;\r\nI&#39;m trying to display the `Fragments` with a ViewPager but **the problem is that when I scroll from a `Fragment` to another, then come back to the already created `Fragment`, it doesnt register the touch event**, nothing happens, not even an error nor exception.&lt;br&gt;\r\nIf I go to a newly created `Fragment` the touch works just fine.&lt;br&gt;\r\nAlso, after switching back to an already created `Fragment` **if I scroll even just a little bit to another `Fragment` and comeback or through the `ArrayList` of that `Fragment` for some reason it starts to recognize the touch in the `ArrayList` items again.**\r\n\r\n## Similar questions that didn&#39;t really help ##\r\n-

wrapping the `ViewPager2` but there is no difference&lt;br&gt;\r\n- I&#39;ve been reading some of the official viewPager2 examples that are written in Kotlin but none of them seem to have a similar situation (also it&#39;s hard for me to read Kotlin code)\r\n\r\n## Code Snippets ##\r\n*word_list.xml:*\r\n```lang-html\r\n&lt;ListView

My personal advice it to stay away from it as long as you can."}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":21851467,"reputation":682,"user_id":16143492,"display_name":"nineninesevenfour"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1688297865,"creation_date":1688297865,"answer_id":76598696,"question_id":76351805,"body_markdown":"No\r\n==\r\nJigsaw does not support versioning at all.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that Jigsaw does in this respect is to prohibit having more than one module exporting the same package.

This data storage has nothing to do with how spreadsheet data normally are stored in a sheet. It looks as if someone tried mimic the JSON in the sheet. That&#39;s unusual, but so be it.\r\n\r\nSheets are stored row by row. And in your case each row may have one cell stored with following meaning:\r\n\r\n - If first cell in row, then this is the key of the level 1 object.\r\n - If second cell in row, then this is the key of the level 2 object.\r\n - If third cell in row, then this is a item of the level 3 array.\r\n - The level 1 object maps a list of n level 2 objects to the key.\r\n - The level 2 object maps a list of n level 3 arrays to the key.\r\n - The level 3 array contais n array items each.\r\n\r\nKnowing this, the simplest way to produce JSON from this will be using a StringBuilder to append the found keys and/or array items delimeted with opening and closing tags. To open an object, &quot;{&quot; gets used. To open an array, &quot;[&quot; gets used. To close an object, when another follows, &quot;},&quot; gets used. To close an array, when another follows, &quot;],&quot; gets used. To close an object, when no other follows, &quot;}&quot; gets used. To close an array, when no other follows, &quot;]&quot; gets used. Array items are opened with no tag and closed using &quot;,&quot; when another follows and using no tag, when no other folows.\r\n\r\nThe following code implements that logic. It produces a JSON text.\r\n\r\nTo validate whether that JSON is valid, it uses [org.json.JSONObject](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java) to construct a `JSONObject` from that text.\r\n\r\n\r\n    import org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.*;\r\n    import java.io.FileInputStream;\r\n    \r\n    import org.json.JSONObject;\r\n    \r\n    class ReadExcelToJSON {\r\n    \r\n     public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n    \r\n      Workbook workbook = WorkbookFactory.create(new FileInputStream(&quot;./ExcelExample.xlsx&quot;));\r\n      DataFormatter dataFormatter = new DataFormatter(new java.util.Locale(&quot;en&quot;, &quot;US&quot;));\r\n      // from 5.2.0 on the DataFormatter can set to use cached values for formula cells\r\n      dataFormatter.setUseCachedValuesForFormulaCells(true);\r\n      \r\n      Sheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(0);\r\n      Cell cell;\r\n      String cellValue;\r\n      \r\n      int firstRowNum = sheet.getFirstRowNum();\r\n      short firstCellNum = sheet.getRow(firstRowNum).getFirstCellNum();\r\n    \r\n      StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();\r\n      boolean level1Open = false;\r\n      boolean level2Open = false;\r\n      boolean level3Open = false;\r\n      \r\n      stringBuilder.append(&quot;{\\n&quot;);\r\n      for (Row row : sheet) {\r\n       cell = row.getCell(firstCellNum + 0);\r\n       cellValue = dataFormatter.formatCellValue(cell);\r\n       if (!&quot;&quot;.equals(cellValue)) { //level 1 key found\r\n        // if previous levels are open, close them\r\n        if (level3Open) {\r\n         stringBuilder.append(&quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n         level3Open = false;\r\n        }\t \r\n        if (level2Open) {\r\n         stringBuilder.append(&quot;  ]\\n&quot;);\r\n         level2Open = false;\r\n        }\r\n        // if same level is open, close it followed by comma, because a new one get opened now\t\r\n        if (level1Open) {\r\n         stringBuilder.append(&quot; },\\n&quot;);\r\n         level1Open = false;\r\n        }\t \r\n    \tstringBuilder.append(&quot; \\&quot;&quot; + cellValue + &quot;\\&quot;: {\\n&quot;);\r\n    \tlevel1Open = true;\r\n       } else {\r\n        cell = row.getCell(firstCellNum + 1);\r\n        cellValue = dataFormatter.formatCellValue(cell);\r\n        if (!&quot;&quot;.equals(cellValue)) { //level 2 key found\r\n    \t // if previous levels are open, close them\r\n         if (level3Open) {\r\n          stringBuilder.append(&quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n          level3Open = false;\r\n         }\r\n         // if same level is open, close it followed by comma, because a new one get opened now\t\t \r\n         if (level2Open) {\r\n          stringBuilder.append(&quot;  ],\\n&quot;);\r\n          level2Open = false;\r\n         }\t \r\n    \t stringBuilder.append(&quot;  \\&quot;&quot; + cellValue + &quot;\\&quot;: [\\n&quot;);\r\n         level2Open = true;\r\n        } else {\r\n         cell = row.getCell(firstCellNum + 2);\r\n         cellValue = dataFormatter.formatCellValue(cell);\r\n         if (!&quot;&quot;.equals(cellValue)) { //level 3 array item found\r\n          if (level3Open) {\r\n    \t   // if same level is open, close it followed by comma, because a new one get opened now\r\n           stringBuilder.append(&quot;,\\n&quot;);\r\n           level3Open = false;\r\n          }\t \r\n    \t  stringBuilder.append(&quot;   \\&quot;&quot; + cellValue + &quot;\\&quot;&quot;);\r\n    \t  level3Open = true;\r\n         } else {\r\n          // empty row, do nothing\r\n         }\t   \r\n        }\t   \r\n       }\r\n      }\r\n      // if previous levels are open, close them\r\n      if (level3Open) {\r\n       stringBuilder.append(&quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n       level3Open = false;\r\n      }\t \r\n      if (level2Open) {\r\n       stringBuilder.append(&quot;  ]\\n&quot;);\r\n       level2Open = false;\r\n      }\t \r\n      if (level1Open) {\r\n       stringBuilder.append(&quot; }\\n&quot;);\r\n       level1Open = false;\r\n      }\t \r\n      stringBuilder.append(&quot;}\\n&quot;);\r\n     \r\n      String jsonText = stringBuilder.toString();\r\n      System.out.println(jsonText);\r\n      \r\n      JSONObject jsonObject= new JSONObject(jsonText);\r\n      System.out.println(jsonObject.toString(1));\r\n    \r\n      workbook.close();\r\n     }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\r\nFollowing is the above approach coded more dynamic. \r\n\r\nIt uses the used range of the sheet from first row to last column.
