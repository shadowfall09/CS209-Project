I've found some code examples, but this leaves me wondering how should I work with transactions?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","text","game-development","adventure"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":20098138,"reputation":33,"user_id":14737232,"display_name":"Brayden"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1671170634,"creation_date":1671170634,"answer_id":74820733,"question_id":74820338,"body_markdown":"In your `Room` class&#39;s constructor, you set the item, monster, and all the rooms to `null` by default.

If you then transform it again, the new transformation will be add to the old one (so if you rotated by 45 degrees and then rotate again by 45 degrees, the transformation would now be 90 degrees).</p>\n<p>It's typically &quot;easiest&quot; to <code>create</code> a &quot;copy&quot; of the <code>Graphics</code> state first, apply your transformations and paint operations and then <code>dispose</code> of the copy, which will leave the original context in it's original (transformed) state (all painting operations applied), this way you don't to spend time trying to figure out how to undo the mess</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1jnlN.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1jnlN.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<pre><code>import java.awt.Color;\nimport java.awt.Dimension;\nimport java.awt.EventQueue;\nimport java.awt.Graphics;\nimport java.awt.Graphics2D;\nimport java.awt.image.BufferedImage;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.util.logging.Level;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\nimport javax.imageio.ImageIO;\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\nimport javax.swing.JPanel;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        new Main();\n    }\n\n    public Main() {\n        EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                try {\n                    JFrame frame = new JFrame();\n\n                    frame.add(new MyDrawPanel());\n                    frame.pack();\n                    frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\n                    frame.setVisible(true);\n                } catch (IOException ex) {\n                    Logger.getLogger(Main.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    class MyDrawPanel extends JPanel {\n\n        private BufferedImage image;\n\n        public MyDrawPanel() throws IOException {\n            image = ImageIO.read(getClass().getResource(&quot;/images/MegaTokyo.png&quot;));\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public Dimension getPreferredSize() {\n            return new Dimension(1000, 1000);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {\n            super.paintComponent(g);\n            if (image == null) {\n                return;\n            }\n            Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) g.create();\n            drawImageTopLeft(g2d);\n            drawImageBottomRight(g2d);\n            drawImageMiddle(g2d);\n\n            g2d.rotate(Math.toRadians(45), getWidth() / 2, getHeight() / 2);\n            g2d.setColor(Color.BLACK);\n            g2d.drawRect(0, 0, this.getWidth(), this.getHeight());\n            g2d.dispose();\n        }\n\n        protected void drawImageTopLeft(Graphics2D g2d) {\n            g2d = (Graphics2D) g2d.create();\n            int x = 0;\n            int y = 0;\n\n            g2d.rotate(Math.toRadians(135), image.getWidth() / 2, image.getHeight() / 2);\n            g2d.drawImage(image, x, y, this);\n            g2d.dispose();\n        }\n\n        protected void drawImageBottomRight(Graphics2D g2d) {\n            g2d = (Graphics2D) g2d.create();\n            int x = (getWidth() - image.getWidth());\n            int y = (getHeight() - image.getHeight());\n\n            g2d.rotate(Math.toRadians(-45), getWidth() - (image.getWidth() / 2), getHeight() - (image.getHeight() / 2));\n            g2d.drawImage(image, x, y, this);\n            g2d.dispose();\n        }\n\n        protected void drawImageMiddle(Graphics2D g2d) {\n            g2d = (Graphics2D) g2d.create();\n            int x = (getWidth() - image.getWidth()) / 2;\n            int y = (getHeight() - image.getHeight()) / 2;\n\n            g2d.rotate(Math.toRadians(45), getWidth() / 2, getHeight() / 2);\n            g2d.drawImage(image, x, y, this);\n            g2d.dispose();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":6109904,"reputation":7,"user_id":4766545,"display_name":"riar"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":313,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":74820248,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1671165483,"creation_date":1671162449,"question_id":74819982,"body_markdown":"I am new to Java programming  and I am trying to rotate an image using the following code but nothing seems to be working, I searched a lot online but nothing helped.

However, this is somewhat inefficient; a _lot_ of strings used in JVMs across the planet, even in places that don&#39;t use the basic alphabet in daily discourse, are 100% consisting of ASCII characters. Like, 95%+ of them. And yet, strings were expending 16 bits per characters, which is painful.\r\n\r\nSo, things were changed. Now, the backing storage mechanism __is a `byte[]`__, and the string ships with a separate flag that indicates what&#39;s in that. That mechanism hasn&#39;t changed since the change (so, we&#39;re now on &#39;v2&#39; of the string implementation, I guess): The only 2 storage mechanisms used are &#39;LATIN1&#39;, which means each character takes 1 byte, and is to be looked up in the LATIN1 table (which is ASCII with some basic stuff added like &#233;). The other option is - it&#39;s UTF16 (or rather the java slight modification that encodes mostly the `\\0` character differently). Either way, a `char[]` is useless here. At best, you could tell string to treat the data as &#39;java-variant UTF16&#39; and use some _very_ lowlevel ops indeed to just assign the &#39;pointer&#39; to the memory location that contains your char data and now make that the byte data instead, updating the &#39;length&#39; flag to indicate it&#39;s twice as long. Actually allowing this would make it rather very easy for a JVM to hard-crash (coredump), or be a security hole, so JVMs aggressively won&#39;t let you do this, and will &#39;police&#39; its class files (the verifier, if it detects bytecode attempts to do this, will reject a class file).\r\n\r\nBut, even if you manage to get your char data in a byte[] array form, you&#39;re still in trouble\r\n\r\n## Reflection is broken\r\n\r\nThis break gets progressively worse over versions. It starts in java9 with jigsaw. Now, you can still &#39;reflect&#39; as usual, but, there&#39;s a separate concern of module openness which sits above reflection in the sense that the module system can separately also deny access to non-public stuff, and `.setAccessible(true)` in the reflection API doesn&#39;t change this (there is no way to override it with java code without hacks). You can dance around this by adding a bevy of very complicated `--add-opens` switches.\r\n\r\nUsing reflection to tinker with internals is being eliminated more and more with every java release.\r\n\r\n## Software doesn&#39;t work this way\r\n\r\n`private` exists for a reason. Whilst the jigsaw &#39;module&#39; break really is a break, and OpenJDK team should (and has) taken flak for breaking contracts by doing that, the change in how `j.l.String` internally represents data is no problem at all: `private` (and package private) include the word __private__ for a reason: It&#39;s a contract that states: Any future version may work _completely_ differently. This may occur at any time, in a point update (so, from 1.2.3 to 1.2.4), without warning, and with zero care given to any code that depended on the private stuff being there.\r\n\r\nYou can develop like this, no problem. It just means you need to set an alert in your agenda that you check in with the openjdk commits every other month and program your software into a giant mess o switch statements or what not, as you&#39;ll be reprogramming the feature for every release, and you can&#39;t upgrade anything until you&#39;ve ensured that you&#39;ve checked every &#39;uses private stuff&#39; hackery in your codebase. Forever. This can be worth it, but, it&#39;s a high cost to pay. It&#39;s rather unlikely that it is worth it here.\r\n\r\n## Solutions\r\n\r\nIf you _actually_ have a performance problem (that would imply you have either millions of these char arrays, or that the char array is many millions of characters in size), which I rather doubt, you have various solutions\r\n\r\n## `CharSequence`\r\n\r\nCharSequence is the interface that various string-esques implement, such as `StringBuilder`. You can easily write your own implementation of `CharSequence` that works directly off of a backing char array. Any code that works on CharSequence would work directly. Unfortunately, lots of code requires that you pass in an instance of `String`, which, as a final class, you can&#39;t modify or proxy.\r\n\r\n## reflection\r\n\r\nFor now you can probably still reflect, but you&#39;d have to change whatever code you have that ends in &#39;... and now I have a `char[]` array&#39;. That code needs to decide:\r\n\r\nIf on JDK9 or 10, just break (or look up when this string change was introduced, 9/10 being non-LTS versions, I wouldn&#39;t care about it).\r\n\r\nIf on JDK8 or below, make a char array and start shoving the data in here.

However, this is somewhat inefficient; a <em>lot</em> of strings used in JVMs across the planet, even in places that don't use the basic alphabet in daily discourse, are 100% consisting of ASCII characters. Like, 95%+ of them. And yet, strings were expending 16 bits per characters, which is painful.</p>\n<p>So, things were changed. Now, the backing storage mechanism <strong>is a <code>byte[]</code></strong>, and the string ships with a separate flag that indicates what's in that. That mechanism hasn't changed since the change (so, we're now on 'v2' of the string implementation, I guess): The only 2 storage mechanisms used are 'LATIN1', which means each character takes 1 byte, and is to be looked up in the LATIN1 table (which is ASCII with some basic stuff added like é). The other option is - it's UTF16 (or rather the java slight modification that encodes mostly the <code>\\0</code> character differently). Either way, a <code>char[]</code> is useless here. At best, you could tell string to treat the data as 'java-variant UTF16' and use some <em>very</em> lowlevel ops indeed to just assign the 'pointer' to the memory location that contains your char data and now make that the byte data instead, updating the 'length' flag to indicate it's twice as long. Actually allowing this would make it rather very easy for a JVM to hard-crash (coredump), or be a security hole, so JVMs aggressively won't let you do this, and will 'police' its class files (the verifier, if it detects bytecode attempts to do this, will reject a class file).</p>\n<p>But, even if you manage to get your char data in a byte[] array form, you're still in trouble</p>\n<h2>Reflection is broken</h2>\n<p>This break gets progressively worse over versions. It starts in java9 with jigsaw. Now, you can still 'reflect' as usual, but, there's a separate concern of module openness which sits above reflection in the sense that the module system can separately also deny access to non-public stuff, and <code>.setAccessible(true)</code> in the reflection API doesn't change this (there is no way to override it with java code without hacks). You can dance around this by adding a bevy of very complicated <code>--add-opens</code> switches.</p>\n<p>Using reflection to tinker with internals is being eliminated more and more with every java release.</p>\n<h2>Software doesn't work this way</h2>\n<p><code>private</code> exists for a reason. Whilst the jigsaw 'module' break really is a break, and OpenJDK team should (and has) taken flak for breaking contracts by doing that, the change in how <code>j.l.String</code> internally represents data is no problem at all: <code>private</code> (and package private) include the word <strong>private</strong> for a reason: It's a contract that states: Any future version may work <em>completely</em> differently. This may occur at any time, in a point update (so, from 1.2.3 to 1.2.4), without warning, and with zero care given to any code that depended on the private stuff being there.</p>\n<p>You can develop like this, no problem. It just means you need to set an alert in your agenda that you check in with the openjdk commits every other month and program your software into a giant mess o switch statements or what not, as you'll be reprogramming the feature for every release, and you can't upgrade anything until you've ensured that you've checked every 'uses private stuff' hackery in your codebase. Forever. This can be worth it, but, it's a high cost to pay. It's rather unlikely that it is worth it here.</p>\n<h2>Solutions</h2>\n<p>If you <em>actually</em> have a performance problem (that would imply you have either millions of these char arrays, or that the char array is many millions of characters in size), which I rather doubt, you have various solutions</p>\n<h2><code>CharSequence</code></h2>\n<p>CharSequence is the interface that various string-esques implement, such as <code>StringBuilder</code>. You can easily write your own implementation of <code>CharSequence</code> that works directly off of a backing char array. Any code that works on CharSequence would work directly. Unfortunately, lots of code requires that you pass in an instance of <code>String</code>, which, as a final class, you can't modify or proxy.</p>\n<h2>reflection</h2>\n<p>For now you can probably still reflect, but you'd have to change whatever code you have that ends in '... and now I have a <code>char[]</code> array'. That code needs to decide:</p>\n<p>If on JDK9 or 10, just break (or look up when this string change was introduced, 9/10 being non-LTS versions, I wouldn't care about it).</p>\n<p>If on JDK8 or below, make a char array and start shoving the data in here. Then use reflection to call the <code>(char[], true)</code> variant.</p>\n<p>if on JDK11 or up, make a byte array, fill that up - LATIN1 style (1 byte per char) if possible, java-modded UTF16 style otherwise, then use the <code>new String(byte[] value, byte coder)</code> constructor (Which isn't there in JDK8 - it's one <em>or</em> the other, depending on java release), passing <code>LATIN1</code> (byte value 0) or <code>UTF16</code> (byte value 1) as needed.</p>\n<h2>Don't use strings in the first place</h2>\n<p><code>CharBuffer</code>, <code>ByteBuffer</code>, <code>java.io.Reader</code> and <code>java.io.Writer</code> may all be more relevant data types. This requires changing the code that <em>currently</em> produces a char array (or not - a <code>CharBuffer</code> can be made wrapped around an existing array, i.e. turning an already existing 10 million char large char[] into a CharBuffer instance is cheap), and also the code that currently requires a <code>String</code> - it would have to require one of those instead.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":4794086,"reputation":1180,"user_id":3872500,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"Rohan"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":73,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1671158744,"creation_date":1671150250,"question_id":74818993,"body_markdown":"My goal is to create strings from char arrays in Java.

The two-int constructor is [`Rectangle(int width, int height)`][1], and it implicitly sets the upper-left corner to `(0, 0)`, which is why your code prints `true`.\n\nYou need to specify your first point as the upper-left corner to a zero-width rectangle before adding the remaining point. Use the four-int constructor for this: [`Rectangle(int x, int y, int width, int height)`][2].\n\n    Rectangle bounds = new Rectangle(16, 14, 0, 0);\n    bounds.add(12, 18);\n    bounds.add(8, 14);\n    bounds.add(12, 10);\n\n    System.out.println(bounds.contains(1,1));\n\nNow keep in mind the following quote from the docs for [`Rectangle.add(Point)`][3]:\n\n&gt; After adding a point, a call to contains with the added point as an argument does not necessarily return true. The contains method does not return true for points on the right or bottom edges of a Rectangle.

See the diagram below:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nA better choice would be [`java.awt.Polygon`][3]. You could construct it via\r\n\r\n    Polygon p = new Polygon(new int[] {16, 12, 8, 12}, new int[] {14, 18, 14, 10}, 4);\r\n\r\nor alternatively\r\n\r\n    Polygon p = new Polygon();\r\n    p.addPoint(16, 14);\r\n    p.addPoint(12, 18);\r\n    p.addPoint(8, 14);\r\n    p.addPoint(12, 10);\r\n\r\nThe main issue with using `Polygon` is that it is intended for manipulating graphical elements and is not really designed to handle non-integer math very well.

One is the main class which instantiates the second class. On startup the second class is not on the classpath. After the cli program started it&#39;ll prompt you to press enter. Before you press enter you copy the second class on the classpath. After you press enter the second class is instantiated. If the classpath would be final on JVM startup this would throw an Exception. But it doesn&#39;t. So I assume the classpath is not final on JVM startup.\r\n\r\nHere are the source codes:\r\n\r\nJVMTest.java\r\n\r\n    package jvmtest;\r\n\r\n    import java.io.Console;\r\n    import jvmtest.MyClass;\r\n\r\n    public class JVMTest {\r\n      public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;JVMTest started ...&quot;);\r\n\r\n        Console c = System.console();\r\n        String enter = c.readLine(&quot;Press Enter to proceed&quot;);\r\n        MyClass myClass = new MyClass();\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Bye Bye&quot;);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMyClass.java\r\n\r\n    package jvmtest;\r\n\r\n    public class MyClass {\r\n      public MyClass() {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;MyClass v2&quot;);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe folder structure looks like this:\r\n\r\n    jvmtest/\r\n      JVMTest.class\r\n      MyClass.class\r\n\r\nI started the cli program with this command:\r\n\r\n    &gt; java -cp /tmp/ jvmtest.JVMTest\r\n\r\nAs you can see I had my jvmtest folder in /tmp/jvmtest. You obviously have to change this according to where you put the classes.\r\n\r\nSo here are the steps I performed:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure only JVMTest.class is in jvmtest.\r\n2. Start the program with the command from above.\r\n3. Just to be sure press enter. You should see an Exception telling you that no class could be found.\r\n4. Now start the program again.\r\n5. After the program started and you are prompted to press enter copy the MyClass file into the jvmtest folder.\r\n6. Press enter. You should see &quot;MyClass v1&quot;.\r\n\r\nAdditional notes:\r\n\r\nThis also worked when I packed the MyClass class in a jar and run the test above.\r\n\r\nI ran this on my Macbook Pro running Mac OS X 10.6.3\r\n\r\n    &gt; Java -version\r\n\r\nresults in:\r\n\r\n    java version &quot;1.6.0_20&quot;\r\n    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_20-b02-279-10M3065)\r\n    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 16.3-b01-279, mixed mode)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/users/312172/user-unknown","title":"Is the Java classpath final after JVM startup?","body":"<p>Since nobody could give my a definite answer nor a link to a corresponding part of the documentation I provide a answer myself.

Using this approach you get separation of concerns as you don&#39;t tie a graphical view of your Word object with it&#39;s textual toString method; so toString could continue to have different output (for example full information on Word fields with a word name and a description for debugging purposes).  \r\n\r\n*Customization of cells using graphic nodes*\r\n\r\nAlso, a cell factory is more flexible as you can apply various graphical nodes to create a visual representation of your data beyond just a straight text string (if you wish to do that).  Any node (including layout panes comprising multiple nodes) can be added to a cell using [setGraphic(node)](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/19/javafx.controls/javafx/scene/control/Labeled.html#setGraphic(javafx.scene.Node)), usually also setting text to null with `setText(null)`, though you can have both a graphic and text if you wish.\r\n\r\nAs an demonstration of this approach, the example can be updated to define a custom list cell which sets a graphic.\r\n\r\n[![listview with graphic][3]][3]\r\n\r\nReplace the `setCellFactory` call with:\r\n\r\n    listViewOfWords.setCellFactory(param -&gt; new WordListCell());\r\n\r\nAnd add the following class:\r\n\r\n    private static class WordListCell extends ListCell&lt;Word&gt; {\r\n        private final Label title = new Label();\r\n        private final Label detail = new Label();\r\n        private final VBox layout = new VBox(title, detail);\r\n\r\n        public WordListCell() {\r\n            super();\r\n            title.setStyle(&quot;-fx-font-size: 20px;&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        protected void updateItem(Word item, boolean empty) {\r\n            super.updateItem(item, empty);\r\n\r\n            setText(null);\r\n\r\n            if (empty || item == null || item.getWord() == null) {\r\n                title.setText(null);\r\n                detail.setText(null);\r\n                setGraphic(null);\r\n            } else {\r\n                title.setText(item.getWord());\r\n                detail.setText(\r\n                        item.getDefinition() != null\r\n                                ? item.getDefinition()\r\n                                : &quot;Undefined&quot;\r\n                );\r\n                setGraphic(layout);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n*Immutable objects (records) recommended unless dynamic field updates required*\r\n\r\nAlso, as an aside, I recommend making your Word objects [immutable objects][4], by removing their setters (or using [records][5] in Java 16+).  If you really need to modify the word objects themselves, then the best way to handle that is to have exposed observable properties in classes for the object fields.  \r\n\r\nTo convert the application above to use immutable objects, replace the `Word` class definition with a `Word` record definition.\r\n\r\n    public record Word(String word, String definition) {}\r\n\r\nThen, whenever you access the fields in the records, don&#39;t use the get prefix.  For example in the cell factory, as `item` is a `Word`, use `item.word()` rather than `item.getWord()` to get the word string from the Word.\r\n\r\n*Dynamic updates*\r\n\r\nJust adding and removing to the underlying observable items list will trigger updates to the view.\r\n\r\nIf you also want your UI to update as the observable properties of your objects change, then you need to make your list cells aware of the changes to the associated items, by listening for changes to them (which is quite a bit more complex in this case, an [extractor](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31687642/callback-and-extractors-for-javafx-observablelist) can help).  Note that, the list containing the words is already observable and ListView will take care of handling changes to that list, but if you modified the word definition for instance within a displayed word object, then your list view wouldn&#39;t pick up changes to the definition without appropriate listener logic in the ListView cell factory (or, preferably, an extractor).\r\n\r\nExample of extractor definition for an ObservableList of the Word objects.  For this to work, the Word class has been updated to use properties for its fields rather than simple types.\r\n\r\n    ObservableList&lt;Word&gt; wordsList = FXCollections.observableArrayList(word -&gt;\r\n            new Observable[] {\r\n                    word.wordProperty(),\r\n                    word.definitionProperty()\r\n            }\r\n    );\r\n\r\nA full example demonstrating the usage of an extractor.  \r\n\r\nIn the example, the &quot;Update second word&quot; button has been pressed three times, to update the word.  On each press, the current count of times the word has been updated is appended to the word.  Without the extractor to notify of changes, the second word in the list would not be updated when the button is pressed.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][6]][6]\r\n\r\n    import javafx.application.Application;\r\n    import javafx.beans.Observable;\r\n    import javafx.beans.property.SimpleStringProperty;\r\n    import javafx.beans.property.StringProperty;\r\n    import javafx.collections.*;\r\n    import javafx.geometry.Insets;\r\n    import javafx.scene.Scene;\r\n    import javafx.scene.control.*;\r\n    import javafx.scene.layout.Priority;\r\n    import javafx.scene.layout.VBox;\r\n    import javafx.stage.Stage;\r\n    \r\n    public class CellFactoriesWithExtractor extends Application {\r\n        private int nChanges = 0;\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void start(Stage stage) {\r\n            ObservableList&lt;Word&gt;

I hope it helps anyone who encounters a similar problem.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":21205228,"reputation":41,"user_id":15595013,"display_name":"MeloMan"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":93,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":74776924,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1671143578,"creation_date":1641313886,"question_id":70582020,"body_markdown":"Greeting, wise ones!\r\n\r\nI am trying to make a generator for pictures like [this one][1].

But if I delete the configuration class (so I don&#39;t configure the ThreadPoolTaskExecutor bean), the app compiles and runs perfectly, but I see in the logs that it uses only one thread:\r\n\r\n    2022-10-09 18:50:56.027  INFO [accounts,27e5f8bb1b00cda3,27e5f8bb1b00cda3] 2396 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] c.d.b.a.s.client.RetrieveDetailsAsync    : Attempting to retr\r\n    ieve accounts details, thread =  http-nio-8080-exec-1\r\n    Hibernate: select accounts0_.account_number as account_1_0_, accounts0_.account_type as account_2_0_, accounts0_.branch_address as branch_a3_0_, accounts0_.create_\r\n    dt as create_d4_0_, accounts0_.customer_id as customer5_0_ from accounts accounts0_ where accounts0_.customer_id=?\r\n    2022-10-09 18:50:56.341  INFO [accounts,27e5f8bb1b00cda3,27e5f8bb1b00cda3] 2396 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] c.d.b.a.s.client.RetrieveDetailsAsync    : Attempting to retr\r\n    ieve loans details, thread =  http-nio-8080-exec-1\r\n    2022-10-09 18:50:57.701  INFO [accounts,27e5f8bb1b00cda3,27e5f8bb1b00cda3] 2396 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] c.d.b.a.s.client.RetrieveDetailsAsync    : Attempting to retr\r\n    ieve cards details, thread =  http-nio-8080-exec-1\r\n\r\nIt look s that it creates and uses only one thread. So the 3 requests aren&#39;t done concurrently? From my research I understand that if I don&#39;t configure this ThreadPoolTaskExecutor bean, it will use SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor by default. If there is only one thread http-nio-8080-exec-1, does this mean that first request uses this thread, after the request is finished, the second request uses the same thread and after that the third request uses the same thread. So the request aren&#39;t done concurrently? \r\n\r\nAnd another question is about ThreadPoolExecutor (the implementation for ExecutorService interface). What exactly is the difference between ThreadPoolTaskExecutor and ThreadPoolExecutor. Is the difference only the fact that the first is from spring framework and the second is from JEE? Because I see that both uses tasks concurrently? And because ThreadPoolTaskExecutor is from Spring framework, it is better to use it in Spring Boot projects. Thank you for response!

But if I delete the configuration class (so I don't configure the ThreadPoolTaskExecutor bean), the app compiles and runs perfectly, but I see in the logs that it uses only one thread:</p>\n<pre><code>2022-10-09 18:50:56.027  INFO [accounts,27e5f8bb1b00cda3,27e5f8bb1b00cda3] 2396 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] c.d.b.a.s.client.RetrieveDetailsAsync    : Attempting to retr\nieve accounts details, thread =  http-nio-8080-exec-1\nHibernate: select accounts0_.account_number as account_1_0_, accounts0_.account_type as account_2_0_, accounts0_.branch_address as branch_a3_0_, accounts0_.create_\ndt as create_d4_0_, accounts0_.customer_id as customer5_0_ from accounts accounts0_ where accounts0_.customer_id=?\n2022-10-09 18:50:56.341  INFO [accounts,27e5f8bb1b00cda3,27e5f8bb1b00cda3] 2396 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] c.d.b.a.s.client.RetrieveDetailsAsync    : Attempting to retr\nieve loans details, thread =  http-nio-8080-exec-1\n2022-10-09 18:50:57.701  INFO [accounts,27e5f8bb1b00cda3,27e5f8bb1b00cda3] 2396 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] c.d.b.a.s.client.RetrieveDetailsAsync    : Attempting to retr\nieve cards details, thread =  http-nio-8080-exec-1\n</code></pre>\n<p>It look s that it creates and uses only one thread. So the 3 requests aren't done concurrently? From my research I understand that if I don't configure this ThreadPoolTaskExecutor bean, it will use SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor by default. If there is only one thread http-nio-8080-exec-1, does this mean that first request uses this thread, after the request is finished, the second request uses the same thread and after that the third request uses the same thread. So the request aren't done concurrently?</p>\n<p>And another question is about ThreadPoolExecutor (the implementation for ExecutorService interface). What exactly is the difference between ThreadPoolTaskExecutor and ThreadPoolExecutor. Is the difference only the fact that the first is from spring framework and the second is from JEE? Because I see that both uses tasks concurrently? And because ThreadPoolTaskExecutor is from Spring framework, it is better to use it in Spring Boot projects. Thank you for response!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":6897165,"reputation":7367,"user_id":5298696,"display_name":"CollinD"},"score":5,"creation_date":1671133536,"post_id":74816767,"comment_id":132038744,"body_markdown":"What are you expecting as output?
