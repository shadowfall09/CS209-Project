Notice that two of them map to the same number coincidentally. Both Alice and Carol return `2`. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nMap &lt; String, Integer &gt; otherMap =\r\n        Map.of(\r\n                &quot;Alice&quot; , 2 ,\r\n                &quot;Bob&quot; , 3 ,\r\n                &quot;Carol&quot; , 2\r\n        );\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s dump to console with a call the `Map#toString`. Be aware that [`Map`][2] iterates in an arbitrary order at any random time. By definition, a `Map` is unsorted.\r\n\r\n&gt;otherMap.toString() = {Bob=3, Alice=2, Carol=2}\r\n\r\nNow we define a second map. But this map is a [`NavigableMap`][3], so its keys are kept in sorted order. The sorting by default is their [*natural order*][4]. Alternatively, we can specify a `Comparator`, as done here.\r\n\r\nWe use [`TreeMap`][5] as the concrete class for our `NavigableMap`. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nNavigableMap &lt; String, Integer &gt; navMap = new TreeMap &lt;&gt;( ( k1 , k2 ) -&gt; otherMap.get( k1 ) - otherMap.get( k2 ) );\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy the way, that lambda can be replaced with a method reference passed to [`Comparator.comparingInt`][6]. This is beside the point here, just FYI.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nNavigableMap &lt; String, Integer &gt; navMap = new TreeMap &lt;&gt;( Comparator.comparingInt( otherMap :: get ) );\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy whichever of the two syntaxes, the effect is the same: &#128073; Keys in our *second* map are judged by the value of the matching entry in the *first* map.\r\n\r\nThis means putting &quot;Alice&quot; in our second map has the same effect as putting &quot;Carol&quot; in our second map. Both return a value from the first map of `2`. So they are equivalent. \r\n\r\nLet&#39;s add three entries to our new map. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nnavMap.put( &quot;Alice&quot; , 100 );\r\nnavMap.put( &quot;Bob&quot; , 200 );\r\nnavMap.put( &quot;Carol&quot; , 300 );\r\n```\r\n\r\nApparently you would expect *three* entries in `navMap`. But, no, there are *two* entries in `navMap`. \r\n\r\n&gt;navMap = {Alice=300, Bob=200}\r\n\r\nYou can see that [code run live at Ideone.com][7].\r\n\r\nPutting &quot;Carol&quot; updated the entry for &quot;Alice&quot; with the new value of `300`, rather than make a new third entry. This is because &#128073; you told the `TreeMap` to compare the two keys based on their coincidentally shared value of `2` as returned by the first `Map`. You overrode the default behavior of comparing the text of &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Carol&quot;. \r\n\r\nNot a bug, a feature. Working as documented.\r\n\r\nPop quiz: What if we changed the `put` lines, so that we put Carol before Alice?\r\n\r\n```java\r\nnavMap.put( &quot;Carol&quot; , 300 );\r\nnavMap.put( &quot;Alice&quot; , 100 );\r\nnavMap.put( &quot;Bob&quot; , 200 );\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult is `Carol=100` rather than `Alice=300`:\r\n\r\n&gt;navMap.toString() = {Carol=100, Bob=200}\r\n\r\nWhat happened is:\r\n\r\n 1. We made a new entry into our empty navigable map for &quot;Carol&quot;+300. \r\n 2. We attempted to put &quot;Alice&quot;+100. In doing so, the `TreeMap` did a lookup on the first map, and retrieved the value `2` for the key `Alice`. Well, `2` matches the `2` returned by a lookup for our first entry’s key, `Carol`. So that means `Alice` &amp; `Carol` keys are equivalent. So no need for a new entry. The `TreeMap` updates the existing, singular, entry of &quot;Carol&quot;+300 to be &quot;Carol&quot;+100. \r\n 3. We put &quot;Bob&quot;+200, with the key of &quot;Bob&quot; returning a value from the first map of `3`. Our `TreeMap` has not seen a key whose comparator value is `3`, meaning it does not equal the `2` of the first and only entry. So the `TreeMap` makes a new second entry of &quot;Bob&quot;+200. Three is bigger than two, so the Bob entry sorts after the Carol entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nAnother issue: Your comparator violates the advice in the `TreeMap` Javadoc to make the comparator *consistent with equals*. So you are failing to obey the general contract of the *Map* interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nI have no idea what you were trying to accomplish in your original effort behind this Question.

When its in the `Processing` state it consumes and handles messages off the queue like normal. When it receives the magical poison pill (perhaps a value in the message header/properties, or maybe a specific value in the message itself) it sets its status to `Terminating` and does not process the message. It also uses an async event bus to send a custom `ShutdownConsumerEvent` to an external handler.

This needs to work the same for when you delete (<code>del()</code>) from the array or insert (<code>ins()') values into the array. You would need to inform the method which array index to delete and you would need to inform the 'ins()</code> method at what index to insert a value and what the value will be to insert.</p>\n<p>You can't just have: <code>arr = del(arr);</code>. Well...you can and the code below can do this but it basically deletes the entire array in this situation. Normally you would want to supply the index value for the array element you want to delete. If you want to delete the value <strong>3</strong> from your array then you would want to delete the element at <strong>index 2</strong>, so, the call would be <code>arr = del(arr, 2);</code>, the <strong>3</strong> would end up being deleted.</p>\n<p>The same applies to the <code>ins()</code> method. You know this stuff! You can't just have: <code>arr = ins(arr);</code>. You need something like: <code>arr = ins(arr, 2, 65);</code> - insert the number <strong>65</strong> at index <strong>2</strong> within he supplied array <strong>arr</strong>).</p>\n<p>Below are working examples of <code>add()</code>, <code>del()</code>, and <code>ins()</code> methods.

If you need you can have controller to call a business layer, that will call low lever logic service layer, splitting service in two layers.\n<a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-patterns/9781491971437/ch01.html#idm46407728109088\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-patterns/9781491971437/ch01.html#idm46407728109088</a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":10918288,"reputation":172,"user_id":8025440,"display_name":"Erhode"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":141,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1660730845,"creation_date":1660232699,"question_id":73323513,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m calling out for experienced developers on an architecture question.\r\n\r\nImagine I have a class HighBusinessLogic:\r\n\r\n    public class HighBusinessLogic{\r\n      public void DoBusiness1(){\r\n      }\r\n      public void DoBusiness2(){\r\n      }\r\n      public void DoBusiness3(){\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow this class uses a lower business logic class to do stuff (like a db repository).\r\n\r\n    public class HighBusinessLogic{\r\n      private LowBusinessLogic _lowBusinessLogic;\r\n    \r\n      public HighBusinessLogic(LowBusinessLogic lowBusinessLogic){\r\n        _lowBusinessLogic = lowBusinessLogic;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      public void DoBusiness1(){\r\n        // some code\r\n        _lowBusinessLogic.DoThing(someData)\r\n        // some other code\r\n      }\r\n      public void DoBusiness2(){\r\n        // some code\r\n        _lowBusinessLogic.DoThing(someData)\r\n        // some other code\r\n      }\r\n      public void DoBusiness3(){\r\n        // some code\r\n        _lowBusinessLogic.DoAnotherThing(someData)\r\n        // some other code\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAlright, finally, it happens that their is a lot of time where when I call lowBusinessLogic.DoThing I have to repeat the exact same treatment with the data before. \r\n\r\n\r\n    public class HighBusinessLogic{\r\n      private LowBusinessLogic _lowBusinessLogic;\r\n    \r\n      public HighBusinessLogic(LowBusinessLogic lowBusinessLogic){\r\n        _lowBusinessLogic = lowBusinessLogic;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      public void DoBusiness1(){\r\n        // some code\r\n        DoStuffWithData(someData)        &lt;-- here\r\n        _lowBusinessLogic.DoThing(someData)\r\n        // some other code\r\n      }\r\n      public void DoBusiness2(){\r\n        // some code\r\n        DoStuffWithData(someData)      &lt;-- here\r\n        _lowBusinessLogic.DoThing(someData)\r\n        // some other code\r\n      }\r\n      public void DoBusiness3(){\r\n        // some code\r\n        _lowBusinessLogic.DoAnotherThing(someData)\r\n        // some other code\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI will be tempted to create an intermediate level of abstraction with a new class doing both of DoStuffWithData and DoThing.\r\n\r\n\r\n    public class IntermediateBusinessLogic{\r\n      private LowBusinessLogic _lowBusinessLogic;\r\n    \r\n      public IntermediateBusinessLogic(LowBusinessLogic lowBusinessLogic){\r\n        _lowBusinessLogic = lowBusinessLogic;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      public DoStuffWithDataAndDoThings(Data someData){\r\n        DoStuffWithData(someData)\r\n        _lowBusinessLogic.DoThing(someData)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class HighBusinessLogic{\r\n      private LowBusinessLogic _lowBusinessLogic;\r\n      private IntermediateBusinessLogic _intermediateBusinessLogic;\r\n\r\n      public HighBusinessLogic(\r\n        LowBusinessLogic lowBusinessLogic,\r\n        IntermediateBusinessLogic intermediateBusinessLogic)\r\n      {\r\n        _lowBusinessLogic = lowBusinessLogic;\r\n        _intermediateBusinessLogic = intermediateBusinessLogic;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      public void DoBusiness1(){\r\n        // some code\r\n        _intermediateBusinessLogic.DoStuffWithDataAndDoThings(someData)\r\n        // some other code\r\n      }\r\n      public void DoBusiness2(){\r\n        // some code\r\n        _intermediateBusinessLogic.DoStuffWithDataAndDoThings(someData)\r\n        // some other code\r\n      }\r\n      public void DoBusiness3(){\r\n        // some code\r\n        _lowBusinessLogic.DoAnotherThing(someData)\r\n        // some other code\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut then, I&#39;m mixing to levels of abstraction because DoBusiness3 still uses a low level method without the intermediate treatment.\r\n\r\nMy question is : is that ok??\r\n\r\nSome says you should create a function DoAnotherThing inside the intermediate class that just forward the call to the low business layer.

I decided that my security config is blocking this path cuz I&#39;m not authorized, so I added this to config class:\r\n```java\r\nhttp.authorizeRequests().antMatchers(&quot;/static/**&quot;).permitAll();\r\n```\r\nBut it&#39;a also was useless.

I tried to do next:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I made <code>ResourceConfig</code> class that extends <code>WebMvcConfigurer</code>, but it's not worked:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Configuration\npublic class ResourceConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {\n\n    @Override\n    public void addResourceHandlers(ResourceHandlerRegistry registry) {\n        registry\n        .addResourceHandler(&quot;/static/**&quot;)\n        .addResourceLocations(StaticAbsolutePath.getPath());\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Oh, the <code>StaticAbsolutePath.getPath()</code> is the metod I made to get path to static directory:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class StaticAbsolutePath {\n    private static final String path = &quot;A:\\\\java\\\\projects\\\\books\\\\src\\\\main\\\\resources\\\\static&quot;;\n\n    public StaticAbsolutePath() {\n    }\n    public static String getPath() {\n        return path;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>I decided that my security config is blocking this path cuz I'm not authorized, so I added this to config class:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>http.authorizeRequests().antMatchers(&quot;/static/**&quot;).permitAll();\n</code></pre>\n<p>But it'a also was useless.

I don't want to switch to <code>HttpUrlConnection</code> because Retrofit is so elegant and easy to use.</p>\n\n<h2>Edit 1</h2>\n\n<p>I tried providing custom <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> to OkHttp but no time improvement from this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>OkHttpClient.Builder builder = new OkHttpClient.Builder();\nExecutorService exec = new ThreadPoolExecutor(20, 20, 1, TimeUnit.HOURS, new LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;&gt;());\nDispatcher d = new Dispatcher(exec);\nbuilder.dispatcher(d);\nOkHttpClient okHttpClient = builder.build();\nokHttpClient.dispatcher().setMaxRequests(20);\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Edit 2</h2>\n\n<p>I make all requests to the same endpoint, if this matters</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-mvc","jsp"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":699650,"reputation":16447,"user_id":1299005,"display_name":"Mark Thomas"},"score":0,"creation_date":1660724220,"post_id":73325422,"comment_id":129597458,"body_markdown":"Are you using Spring Boot?","body":"Are you using Spring Boot?"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1929456,"reputation":601,"user_id":1739193,"display_name":"btafarelo"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1660724645,"creation_date":1660245916,"answer_id":73325948,"question_id":73325422,"body_markdown":"This syntax is el (expression language) must be explicit enabled.\r\n\r\nIn the jsp add this parameter **isELIgnored=false**\r\n\r\n    &lt;%@ page language=&quot;java&quot;

childLayoutProvider;\r\n\r\n\r\n    public MainLayout(ServiceA a, Service b, Provider&lt;ChildLayout&gt; childLayoutProvider) {...}\r\n\r\n    public void init(MyDTO dto) {\r\n        List&lt;MyDTO&gt; dtos = ...\r\n        for(MyDTO dto : dtos) { \r\n           var childLayout = provier.get();\r\n           childLayout.setDto(dto);\r\n           // child Layout is ready   \r\n        } \r\n\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile in some cases this method works well, one significant drawback is that you break encapsulation of the childLayout and have to set the dto with a setter.\r\n\r\nSo, you need something similar but in a way that can accept a parameter in constructor (unlike `provider.get()`)\r\n\r\nSpring allows this style by using `java.util.Function` as a bean. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Option 2**\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Configuration\r\npublic class MyConfig {\r\n  \r\n   @Bean\r\n   public Function&lt;MyDTO, ChildLayout&gt; beanFactory() {\r\n        return dto -&gt; childLayout(dto);\r\n   } \r\n\r\n   @Bean\r\n   public MainLayout(ServiceA serviceA, ServiceB serviceB, Function&lt;MyDTO, \r\n          ChildLayout&gt; beanFactory) {\r\n       return new MainLayout(serviceA, ServiceB, beanFactory);\r\n   }\r\n   \r\n   @Bean\r\n   @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)\r\n   public ChildLayout childLayout(MyDTO dto\r\n                                  ... /**possibly other parameters **/) {\r\n       return new ChildLayout(dto);\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@AllArgsConstructor\r\npublic class MainLayout {\r\n    private final ServiceA serviceA;\r\n    private final ServiceB serviceB;\r\n    private final Function&lt;MyDTO, ChildLayout&gt;

If a &quot;default&quot; servlet is defined for the application, it will be used. Many containers provide an implicit default servlet for serving content.\r\n\r\nThe &quot;/&quot; URL mapping indicates the default servlet:\r\n\r\n&gt; A string containing only the &quot;/&quot; character *indicates* the &quot;default&quot; servlet of the application. In this case the servlet path is the request URI minus the context path and the path info is null.\r\n\r\nNote that the word &quot;*indicates*&quot; is used, meaning that it is not a requirement.\r\n\r\nThe default servlet is usually used to serve static content, and is usually included in servlet containers, but it&#39;s not a requirement. \r\n\r\nYou can create your own default servlet (thereby overruling the one provided by the servlet container) by mapping a servlet to &quot;/&quot;. Which usually means that it will disable static file serving, unless the selected servlet (or filters) does it. So if you have a simple servlet that only outputs a simple string like &quot;Hello World&quot;, and set it as default servlet by mapping it to &quot;/&quot;, then you disable things like 404 errors, because your simple servlet won&#39;t throw them. So then all (random) url requests that are not handled by more specific URL mappings, will be caught by the simple servlet.\r\n\r\n# Tomcat #\r\nTomcat about their [DefaultServlet][2]:\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; The default servlet is the servlet which serves static resources as well as serves the directory listings (if directory listings are enabled).\r\n\r\nTomcat also says that you can change their default servlet:\r\n\r\n&gt; If you need to change the DefaultServlet settings for an application\r\n&gt; you can override the default configuration by re-defining the\r\n&gt; DefaultServlet in /WEB-INF/web.xml. However, this will cause problems\r\n&gt; if you attempt to deploy the application on another container as the\r\n&gt; DefaultServlet class will not be recognised.\r\n\r\n# Jetty #\r\nJetty also has a [DefaultServlet][3].\r\n\r\n&gt; This servlet, normally mapped to /, provides the handling for static content, OPTION and TRACE methods for the context.\r\n\r\n# Use cases #\r\n## Change default behavior ##\r\nYou can use the DefaultServlet of your container in case you want to modify default behavior of the servlet container in case no url mapping is found.

In that case, you can forward to the DefaultServlet, which usually use the name &quot;default&quot;, although this does make the app a bit container dependent. This can be done by using `ServletContext.getNamedDispatcher(&quot;default&quot;)`\r\n\r\nSo then you get something like this:\r\n\r\n    public void doFilter(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res, FilterChain chain) {\r\n        if (someCondition) {\r\n            // chain to next filter\r\n            chain.doFilter(req, res);\r\n        } else {\r\n            // forward to DefaultServlet, for example, when you don&#39;t want \r\n            // further filters to be applied on the request of a static resource\r\n            req\r\n                    .getServletContext()\r\n                    .getNamedDispatcher(&quot;default&quot;)\r\n                    .forward(req, res);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/jakarta-servlet-spec-5.0.html\r\n  [2]: https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-10.0-doc/default-servlet.html\r\n  [3]: https://javadoc.io/static/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-servlet/11.0.0/org.eclipse.jetty.servlet/org/eclipse/jetty/servlet/DefaultServlet.html","title":"Is the Default Servlet a (de facto) standard?","body":"<h1>Servlet Specification</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/jakarta-servlet-spec-5.0.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Servlet Specification</a> does mention a &quot;default&quot; servlet, but there is no specification for it, it only mentions how the servlet container should use the default servlet in case it exists, but doesn't describe how the default servlet itself should be implemented.</p>\n<p>The Servlet Specification specifies that if there is no URL mapping for a request:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the container will attempt to serve content appropriate for the resource requested.

Now my project can be successfully deployed and shows &quot;Hellow world&quot; index page. But rest service endpoints still return 404 error.\r\n\r\nWhat i have tried to do myself:\r\n1. Add jersey-container-servlet to pom.xml (as i have found an answer to a similiar question stating that a tomcat is a web server and not the application server like glassfish and it needs JAX-RS libraries deployed with the project)\r\n2. Configure web.xml to explicitly define endpoints for the Tomcat in case of some kind of a problem with annotations (obviously a shot in the air as i don&#39;t know the correct way to configure deployment descriptors for RestfullWeb services, but it was worth a try anyway)\r\n```\r\n    &lt;servlet&gt;\r\n        &lt;display-name&gt;Task RESTfull web service&lt;/display-name&gt;\r\n        &lt;servlet-name&gt;TaskService&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\r\n        &lt;servlet-class&gt;com.mycorp.testproject.service.TaskFacadeREST&lt;/servlet-class&gt;\r\n        &lt;init-param&gt;\r\n            &lt;param-name&gt;javax.ws.rs.Application&lt;/param-name&gt;\r\n            &lt;param-value&gt;com.mycorp.testproject.service.ApplicationConfig&lt;/param-value&gt;\r\n        &lt;/init-param&gt;\r\n    &lt;/servlet&gt;\r\n    &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;\r\n        &lt;servlet-name&gt;TaskService&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\r\n        &lt;url-pattern&gt;/webresources/task&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\r\n    &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first option didn&#39;t help a bit, the second returned error that TaskFacadeREST class is not a servlet class.\r\n\r\nNow i&#39;m completely stuck, can&#39;t find any tutorial on deploying JAX-RS endpoints to Tomcat and don&#39;t know which way to go.

I have created a maven java web application and some RESTfull web services from the database (option NEW -&gt; RestFull web services from the database).</p>\n<p>Netbeans created several classes for me like the following:</p>\n<pre><code>@Stateless\n@Path(&quot;task&quot;)\npublic class TaskFacadeREST extends AbstractFacade&lt;Task&gt; {\n\n    @PersistenceContext(unitName = &quot;com.mycorp_testproject_war_1.0-SNAPSHOTPU&quot;)\n    private EntityManager em;\n\n    public TaskFacadeREST() {\n        super(Task.class);\n    }\n\n    @POST\n    @Override\n    @Consumes({MediaType.APPLICATION_XML, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON})\n    public void create(Task entity) {\n        super.create(entity);\n    }\n\nEntity\n@Table(name = &quot;TASK&quot;)\n@NamedQueries({\n    @NamedQuery(name = &quot;Task.findAll&quot;, query = &quot;SELECT t FROM Task t&quot;),\n    @NamedQuery(name = &quot;Task.findById&quot;, query = &quot;SELECT t FROM Task t WHERE t.id = :id&quot;),\n    @NamedQuery(name = &quot;Task.findByProjectId&quot;, query = &quot;SELECT t FROM Task t WHERE t.projectId = :projectId&quot;),\n    @NamedQuery(name = &quot;Task.findByTypeId&quot;, query = &quot;SELECT t FROM Task t WHERE t.typeId = :typeId&quot;)})\npublic class Task implements Serializable {\n\n    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n    @Basic(optional = false)\n    @Column(name = &quot;ID&quot;)\n    private Long id;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And Application Config class:</p>\n<pre><code>@javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath(&quot;webresources&quot;)\npublic class ApplicationConfig extends Application {\n\n    @Override\n    public Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; getClasses() {\n        Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; resources = new java.util.HashSet&lt;&gt;();\n        addRestResourceClasses(resources);\n        return resources;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Do not modify addRestResourceClasses() method.\n     * It is automatically populated with\n     * all resources defined in the project.\n     * If required, comment out calling this method in getClasses().\n     */\n    private void addRestResourceClasses(Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; resources) {\n        resources.add(com.mycorp.testproject.service.LinkTypeFacadeREST.class);\n        resources.add(com.mycorp.testproject.service.ProjectFacadeREST.class);\n        resources.add(com.mycorp.testproject.service.TaskFacadeREST.class);\n        resources.add(com.mycorp.testproject.service.TaskLinkFacadeREST.class);\n        resources.add(com.mycorp.testproject.service.TaskTypeFacadeREST.class);\n    }\n    \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then there were some errors in project path, dependencies, building process, pom.xml and plugin versions that i managed to fix. Now my project can be successfully deployed and shows &quot;Hellow world&quot; index page. But rest service endpoints still return 404 error.</p>\n<p>What i have tried to do myself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add jersey-container-servlet to pom.xml (as i have found an answer to a similiar question stating that a tomcat is a web server and not the application server like glassfish and it needs JAX-RS libraries deployed with the project)</li>\n<li>Configure web.xml to explicitly define endpoints for the Tomcat in case of some kind of a problem with annotations (obviously a shot in the air as i don't know the correct way to configure deployment descriptors for RestfullWeb services, but it was worth a try anyway)</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>    &lt;servlet&gt;\n        &lt;display-name&gt;Task RESTfull web service&lt;/display-name&gt;\n        &lt;servlet-name&gt;TaskService&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\n        &lt;servlet-class&gt;com.mycorp.testproject.service.TaskFacadeREST&lt;/servlet-class&gt;\n        &lt;init-param&gt;\n            &lt;param-name&gt;javax.ws.rs.Application&lt;/param-name&gt;\n            &lt;param-value&gt;com.mycorp.testproject.service.ApplicationConfig&lt;/param-value&gt;\n        &lt;/init-param&gt;\n    &lt;/servlet&gt;\n    &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;\n        &lt;servlet-name&gt;TaskService&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\n        &lt;url-pattern&gt;/webresources/task&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\n    &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The first option didn't help a bit, the second returned error that TaskFacadeREST class is not a servlet class.</p>\n<p>Now i'm completely stuck, can't find any tutorial on deploying JAX-RS endpoints to Tomcat and don't know which way to go. Will be gratefull for any info, documentattion or tutorial links on what to do next as netbeans tutorials are based on glassfish and do not contain any info on such problems.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","hibernate","hibernate-types"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1580843,"reputation":13479,"user_id":1466267,"accept_rate":91,"display_name":"SpaceTrucker"},"score":0,"creation_date":1660655852,"post_id":73374601,"comment_id":129579300,"body_markdown":"Please add more of the NPE stacktrace so we know at which location of your code the NPE is thrown.","body":"Please add more of the NPE stacktrace so we know at which location of your code the NPE is thrown."},{"owner":{"account_id":26077349,"reputation":79,"user_id":19776112,"display_name":"justrying"},"score":0,"creation_date":1660656206,"post_id":73374601,"comment_id":129579480,"body_markdown":"@SpaceTrucker I have added where the nullpointer is being thrown","body":"@SpaceTrucker I have added where the nullpointer is being thrown"},{"owner":{"account_id":1580843,"reputation":13479,"user_id":1466267,"accept_rate":91,"display_name":"SpaceTrucker"},"score":0,"creation_date":1660656723,"post_id":73374601,"comment_id":129579731,"body_markdown":"Your problem is probably not related to spring boot but how your json column is mapped in hibernate and what data is being stored in the row you are trying to fetch.
