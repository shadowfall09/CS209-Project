Thank you!","title":"How to increase maximum HTTP header size for Java Spring Boot app hosted in Azure App Service (deployed as .WAR)?","body":"<p>We have a Java Spring Boot application hosted in an Azure App Service (Windows), and we need to increase the value of <code>maxHttpHeaderSize</code> on the Tomcat 9 server to probably around 32KB. I can't work out how we can influence the server settings to do this.</p>\n<p>How can I override the <code>maxHttpHeaderSize</code> value for the Tomcat server in the Azure App Service?</p>\n<p>We have an <code>application.yml</code> file where we set various settings, but any server settings in there appear to get ignored by the App Service in Azure. For example, I can fix the issue locally by adding the option in application.yml, but when I deploy that it doesn't make any difference. I've also tried environment variables such as <code>SERVER_MAX_HTTP_HEADER_SIZE</code>, which again works locally but not on the deployed App Service.</p>\n<p>Here are the &quot;Stack settings&quot; from the &quot;Configuration&quot; page for the App Service:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stack: Java</li>\n<li>Java version: Java 11</li>\n<li>Java minor version: Java 11 (auto-update)</li>\n<li>Java web server: Apache Tomcat 9.0</li>\n<li>Java web server version: Apache Tomcat 9.0 (auto-update)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We currently deploy the app via a DevOps pipeline that uploads a <code>.WAR</code>.</p>\n<p>The reason that we need to increase the maximum header size is that we integrate with Azure AD for authentication, and it's adding large headers (due to quite a large number of user groups we think) which are tipping requests over the current limit for some users.</p>\n<p>Any guidance is much appreciated.

I oversaw that `flatMap` not necessarily increases the number of elements. It may also decrease the number of elements by emitting an empty stream for some of the elements. To implement a group-by operation, the function called by `flatMap` needs minimal internal state, namely the most recent element. It either returns an empty stream or, at the end of a group, it returns the reduced-to group representative.\r\n\r\nHere is a quick implementation where `groupBorder` must return `true` if the two elements passed in do not belong to the same group, i.e. between them is the group border. The `combiner` is the group function that combines, for example (1,a), (1,a), (1,a) into (3,a), given that your group elements are, tuples (int, string).\r\n\r\n    public class GroupBy&lt;X&gt; implements Function&lt;X, Stream&lt;X&gt;&gt;{\r\n    \r\n      private final BiPredicate&lt;X, X&gt; groupBorder;\r\n      private final BinaryOperator&lt;X&gt; combiner;\r\n      private X latest = null;\r\n    \r\n      public GroupBy(BiPredicate &lt;X, X&gt; groupBorder,\r\n                     BinaryOperator&lt;X&gt; combiner) {\r\n        this.groupBorder = groupBorder;\r\n        this.combiner = combiner;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      @Override\r\n      public Stream&lt;X&gt; apply(X elem) {\r\n        // TODO: add test on end marker as additonal parameter for constructor\r\n        if (elem==null) {\r\n          return latest==null ? Stream.empty() : Stream.of(latest);\r\n        }\r\n        if (latest==null) {\r\n          latest = elem;\r\n          return Stream.empty();\r\n        }\r\n        if (groupBorder.test(latest, elem)) {\r\n          Stream&lt;X&gt; result = Stream.of(latest);\r\n          latest = elem;\r\n          return result;\r\n        }\r\n        latest = combiner.apply(latest,  elem);\r\n        return Stream.empty();\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThere is one caveat though: to ship the last group of the whole stream, an end marker must be stuck as the last element into the stream. The above code assumes it is `null`, but an additional end-marker-tester could be added. \r\n\r\nI could not come up with a solution that does not rely on the end marker.\r\n\r\nFurther I did not also convert between incoming and outgoing elements. For a unique-operation, this would just work.

I oversaw that <code>flatMap</code> not necessarily increases the number of elements. It may also decrease the number of elements by emitting an empty stream for some of the elements. To implement a group-by operation, the function called by <code>flatMap</code> needs minimal internal state, namely the most recent element. It either returns an empty stream or, at the end of a group, it returns the reduced-to group representative.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a quick implementation where <code>groupBorder</code> must return <code>true</code> if the two elements passed in do not belong to the same group, i.e. between them is the group border. The <code>combiner</code> is the group function that combines, for example (1,a), (1,a), (1,a) into (3,a), given that your group elements are, tuples (int, string).</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class GroupBy&lt;X&gt; implements Function&lt;X, Stream&lt;X&gt;&gt;{\n\n  private final BiPredicate&lt;X, X&gt; groupBorder;\n  private final BinaryOperator&lt;X&gt; combiner;\n  private X latest = null;\n\n  public GroupBy(BiPredicate &lt;X, X&gt; groupBorder,\n                 BinaryOperator&lt;X&gt; combiner) {\n    this.groupBorder = groupBorder;\n    this.combiner = combiner;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public Stream&lt;X&gt; apply(X elem) {\n    // TODO: add test on end marker as additonal parameter for constructor\n    if (elem==null) {\n      return latest==null ?

I found a peculiar issue when I was parsing a doc file with images inside. The Image fetcher was called and it threw <code>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I was trying the same in <code>tika-app 1.22 gui</code> and was getting the following exceptions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Exception in thread \"Image Fetcher 2\" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\n    at java.awt.image.DataBufferInt.&lt;init&gt;(DataBufferInt.java:75)\n    at java.awt.image.Raster.createPackedRaster(Raster.java:467)\n    at java.awt.image.DirectColorModel.createCompatibleWritableRaster(DirectColorModel.java:1032)\n    at sun.awt.image.ImageRepresentation.createBufferedImage(ImageRepresentation.java:253)\n    at sun.awt.image.ImageRepresentation.setPixels(ImageRepresentation.java:559)\n    at sun.awt.image.ImageDecoder.setPixels(ImageDecoder.java:138)\n    at sun.awt.image.PNGImageDecoder.sendPixels(PNGImageDecoder.java:549)\n    at sun.awt.image.PNGImageDecoder.produceImage(PNGImageDecoder.java:470)\n    at sun.awt.image.InputStreamImageSource.doFetch(InputStreamImageSource.java:269)\n    at sun.awt.image.ImageFetcher.fetchloop(ImageFetcher.java:205)\n    at sun.awt.image.ImageFetcher.run(ImageFetcher.java:169)\nException in thread \"Image Fetcher 0\" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\n    at java.awt.image.DataBufferInt.&lt;init&gt;(DataBufferInt.java:75)\n    at java.awt.image.Raster.createPackedRaster(Raster.java:467)\n    at java.awt.image.DirectColorModel.createCompatibleWritableRaster(DirectColorModel.java:1032)\n    at sun.awt.image.ImageRepresentation.createBufferedImage(ImageRepresentation.java:253)\n    at sun.awt.image.ImageRepresentation.setPixels(ImageRepresentation.java:559)\n    at sun.awt.image.ImageDecoder.setPixels(ImageDecoder.java:138)\n    at sun.awt.image.PNGImageDecoder.sendPixels(PNGImageDecoder.java:549)\n    at sun.awt.image.PNGImageDecoder.produceImage(PNGImageDecoder.java:470)\n    at sun.awt.image.InputStreamImageSource.doFetch(InputStreamImageSource.java:269)\n    at sun.awt.image.ImageFetcher.fetchloop(ImageFetcher.java:205)\n    at sun.awt.image.ImageFetcher.run(ImageFetcher.java:169)\nException in thread \"Image Fetcher 1\" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\n    at java.awt.image.DataBufferInt.&lt;init&gt;(DataBufferInt.java:75)\n    at java.awt.image.Raster.createPackedRaster(Raster.java:467)\n    at java.awt.image.DirectColorModel.createCompatibleWritableRaster(DirectColorModel.java:1032)\n    at sun.awt.image.ImageRepresentation.createBufferedImage(ImageRepresentation.java:253)\n    at sun.awt.image.ImageRepresentation.setPixels(ImageRepresentation.java:559)\n    at sun.awt.image.ImageDecoder.setPixels(ImageDecoder.java:138)\n    at sun.awt.image.PNGImageDecoder.sendPixels(PNGImageDecoder.java:549)\n    at sun.awt.image.PNGImageDecoder.produceImage(PNGImageDecoder.java:470)\n    at sun.awt.image.InputStreamImageSource.doFetch(InputStreamImageSource.java:269)\n    at sun.awt.image.ImageFetcher.fetchloop(ImageFetcher.java:205)\n    at sun.awt.image.ImageFetcher.run(ImageFetcher.java:169)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My questions are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Why would I need to fetch the image for text only extraction from\ndocuments? </li>\n<li>How do I configure <code>Tika</code> to skip fetching images\nlike in this case.
