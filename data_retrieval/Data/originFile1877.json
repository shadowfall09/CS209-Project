Do you really need an `ExecutorService` for this?\r\n\r\nYou can just hold the **next task** in a `static` `AtomicReference` field of a POJO object. Since we are interested only in the latest task, task producers may simply replace the object in the `AtomicReference`. The task consumer can get from this field as soon as the current task execution is done. The field must be:\r\n- `static` because there should be only one instance of this field\r\n- `AtomicReference` since multiple threads may be trying to set the next task.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Solving using `ExecutorService`\r\n\r\nHowever, if you still want to go the `ExecutorService` way, you can try this out. Create a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with only **one** thread (core and maximum) and give it a `BlockingQueue` implementation that &quot;forgets&quot; all its elements as soon as a new one is added.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample test code that submits new tasks 100 times.

You will certainly need to improve upon the following drawbacks in this implementation:\r\n\r\n - The first task is anyhow executed because it is immediately picked up by the `ExecutorService`. (This is why the next point becomes important.)\r\n - Interruptibility/cancellability has to be brought in to the running tasks, if necessary\r\n\r\n## Another way using `ExecutorService` and `Future.cancel()`\r\nThis is actually the simplest, **if you are checking thread interruption in the task**.

They are shared e.g. so user 1 adds Oxford uni and then user 2 tries it is not duplicated but already exists and so on.\r\n\r\nOnly a user&#39;s enrolment in a course and therefore the semester and therefore the uni is specific to a user.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Do all these classes need a separate Dao or can one UserDao \r\n\r\n**AllDao** :-\r\n\r\n    @Dao\r\n    abstract class AllDao {\r\n    \r\n

   }\r\n\r\n- up to you if you want to have multiple @Daos\r\n\r\n&gt; how do I separate User data from each other? \r\n\r\nSee above re **UserCourseMap** and the **getUserEvents** dao\r\n\r\n- I would suggest, if happy with the above, considering defining foreign key constraints to enforce referential integrity but have omitted them for brevity and to reduce the complexity of understanding.\r\n\r\nSo with a pretty typical @Database **TheDatabase** :-\r\n\r\n    @Database(entities = [\r\n        User::class,University::class,Semester::class,Course::class,UserCourseMap::class,\r\n        version = 1)\r\n    @TypeConverters(DateTimeConverter::class)\r\n    abstract class TheDatabase: RoomDatabase() {\r\n        abstract fun getAllDao(): AllDao\r\n    \r\n        companion object {\r\n            @Volatile\r\n            private var instance: TheDatabase? = null\r\n            fun getInstance(context: Context): TheDatabase {\r\n                if (instance == null) {\r\n                    instance = Room.databaseBuilder(context,TheDatabase::class.java,&quot;thedatabase.db&quot;)\r\n                        .allowMainThreadQueries()\r\n                        .build()\r\n                }\r\n                return instance as TheDatabase\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n- an exception to being typical is that for brevity `.allowMainThreadQueries` has been utilised.\r\n\r\nFinally putting it all together in a demonstration (that produced the output above) **MainActivity** :-\r\n\r\n    class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {\r\n        lateinit var db: TheDatabase\r\n

I heard bluecove the jsr 82 implementation am using supports bluetooth device simulation with bluecove-emu. I have no idea how to use it to simulate a bluetooth device  and it would help if you could provide me with examples or links to instructions even just give me the instructions right here if you have the time. Thanks in advance. </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","jdbc","connection"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1588532,"reputation":92,"user_id":1472371,"display_name":"Maharsh"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1467286739,"creation_date":1467286739,"answer_id":38122028,"question_id":38121723,"body_markdown":"Following function would return hostname.\r\n\r\n    public String getHostName() {\r\n        String hostName = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        try {\r\n            java.net.InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getLocalHost();\r\n            hostName = addr.getHostName();\r\n        } catch (UnknownHostException ex) {\r\n          System.out.println(&quot;Hostname can not be resolved&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n        return hostName; }","title":"How to get current PC name?","body":"<p>Following function would return hostname.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public String getHostName() {\n    String hostName = \"\";\n    try {\n        java.net.InetAddress addr = InetAddress.getLocalHost();\n        hostName = addr.getHostName();\n    } catch (UnknownHostException ex) {\n      System.out.println(\"Hostname can not be resolved\");\n    }\n    return hostName; }\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":8026949,"reputation":82,"user_id":6053499,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Usman Nawaz"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":3193,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":38122028,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1636154690,"creation_date":1467285890,"question_id":38121723,"body_markdown":"I am working on a project and i want to make my project portable.\r\nConnecting java and SQL server 2012 and using PC Name in the connection.In my case it is `Hwl`. \r\n:\r\n\r\n    Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(&quot;jdbc:sqlserver://localhost\\\\Hwl:1433;databaseName=dbs&quot;,&quot;sa&quot;,&quot;dbase&quot;);\r\n\r\n    Statement statement = conn.createStatement();\r\n\r\n\r\nNow i want to get `PC-Name` (e.g `Hwl` in my case ) on the machine in which that code is running.\r\nI simply want to get the `PC` name and pass that to the `connection string` in each machine where it runs.","title":"How to get current PC name?","body":"<p>I am working on a project and i want to make my project portable.\nConnecting java and SQL server 2012 and using PC Name in the connection.In my case it is <code>Hwl</code>. \n:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(\"jdbc:sqlserver://localhost\\\\Hwl:1433;databaseName=dbs\",\"sa\",\"dbase\");\n\nStatement statement = conn.createStatement();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now i want to get <code>PC-Name</code> (e.g <code>Hwl</code> in my case ) on the machine in which that code is running.\nI simply want to get the <code>PC</code> name and pass that to the <code>connection string</code> in each machine where it runs.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","sockets","io"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3871487,"reputation":314,"user_id":3206654,"display_name":"Alexander_Winter"},"score":1,"creation_date":1390888120,"post_id":21397778,"comment_id":32275804,"body_markdown":"You could show us your code.","body":"You could show us your code."}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2496,"reputation":266234,"user_id":3474,"accept_rate":83,"display_name":"erickson"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1390888248,"creation_date":1390888248,"answer_id":21397881,"question_id":21397778,"body_markdown":"I assume you are using the `readLine()` method on the client&#39;s `BufferedReader`.
