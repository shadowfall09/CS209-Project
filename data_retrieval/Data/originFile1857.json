If you wrote a different value for `abc` in one `Thread` it **may or may not** be seen from another thread. This is the reason the `volatile` keyword was introduced.\r\n\r\nI you want to have **mutable** singleton beans in `Spring` then you need be careful with synchronization and use of `volatile`.\r\n\r\nThe data will not be &quot;corrupted&quot; because, as you point out, `String` is immutable. But one thread may not see that another has changed the value of `abc`.\r\n\r\nSo you have a variable `abc`;\r\n\r\n 1. `abc` = &quot;Hi.&quot;\r\n 2. thread 1 reads `abc` as &quot;Hi.&quot;.\r\n 3. thread 1 changes `abc` by writing to the reference: `abc=&quot;Hello.&quot;`\r\n 4. thread 2 reads `abc`, it is unclear whether `abc` reads &quot;Hi.&quot; or &quot;Hello.&quot;.\r\n\r\n&gt; I make the String abc variable to ThreadLocal object to provide each thread holds their own abc variable\r\n\r\n`ThreadLocal` is used to have each thread be given a different instance of a variable. This is often used to tying state to a thread in a web server as web servers use a thread pre request model.\r\n\r\nTomcat 7 **does not** fix `ThreadLocal` leak issues.

And if not, is there some kind of workaround, or memory management technique I can use to make things work?</p>\n\n<p>here's what my internal classes look like</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class dataNode&lt;T&gt; extends node&lt;T&gt;{\n    int hash;\n    T data;\n\n    public dataNode(int _hash, T _value){\n        this.isArrayNode = false;\n        this.hash = _hash;\n        this.data = _value;\n    }\n\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the other class internal for my lock free hashmap:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.util.concurrent.atomic.*;\npublic class arrayNode&lt;T&gt; extends node&lt;T&gt;{\n\n    //this is an array where elements consist of datanodes and arraynodes\n    AtomicStampedReference&lt;node&lt;T&gt;&gt; [] array;\n\n    public arrayNode(int size){\n        this.isArrayNode = true;\n        array = new AtomicStampedReference[size];\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++){\n            array[i] = new AtomicStampedReference&lt;node&lt;T&gt;&gt;(null, concurMap.UNINITIALIZED);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","multithreading","heap-memory"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2524075,"reputation":36076,"user_id":2193767,"accept_rate":78,"display_name":"TheLostMind"},"score":2,"creation_date":1478241831,"post_id":40416726,"comment_id":68082738,"body_markdown":"The heap is shared among all threads","body":"The heap is shared among all threads"},{"owner":{"account_id":3807187,"reputation":16966,"user_id":3159253,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"user3159253"},"score":1,"creation_date":1478241835,"post_id":40416726,"comment_id":68082741,"body_markdown":"Yes, it&#39;s shared among all threads https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13150_01/jrockit_jvm/jrockit/geninfo/diagnos/garbage_collect.html","body":"Yes, it&#39;s shared among all threads <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13150_01/jrockit_jvm/jrockit/geninfo/diagnos/garbage_collect.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">docs.oracle.com/cd/E13150_01/jrockit_jvm/jrockit/geninfo/&hellip;</a>"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":47283,"reputation":703817,"user_id":139985,"accept_rate":69,"display_name":"Stephen C"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1478242252,"creation_date":1478241898,"answer_id":40416787,"question_id":40416726,"body_markdown":"&gt; ... does each thread in a multi-threaded environment creates their own heap and has the same size?\r\n\r\nNo.  There is a single heap that is shared by all threads in the Java process.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to run a JVM with TLABs (thread local allocation buffers) to reduce allocation-related contention in a multi-threaded application.

That&#39;s why any method invocation on it like `ls.nextLine()` will fail with a NPE.\r\n2. the failing invocation is in class `JepQA`, inside the `getAnswer` method, at line 60 of the file\r\n3. the method `getAnswer` was called by an action-handler, method `actionPerformed` in your `JepGui`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Step 2: Why was an object `null` ?\r\nIn the method `getAnswer` you initialize `ls` as `null` - that&#39;s OK.\r\nThen, inside the try-block, you open the Scanner on a FileInputStream connected to the file given by path:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ntry {\r\n    ls = new Scanner(new FileInputStream(&quot;triviaA&quot;+fileChoose+&quot;.txt&quot;));\r\n} catch(FileNotFoundException z) {\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Error 004: File retrieve failed.&quot;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis Scanner assignment, exactly the opening of the InputStream has failed, thus `ls` became `null` here again.\r\n\r\nReasons for that may be:\r\n 1. `String` argument passed to [`FileInputStream` constructor](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/FileInputStream.html#FileInputStream(java.lang.String)) was `null`. Check or debug-print `&quot;triviaA&quot;+fileChoose+&quot;.txt&quot;`. Also make sure that `fileChoose` itself is not `null`, otherwise the whole concatenated expression passed as argument will be `null` too.\r\n 2. there was an Exception like [`FileNotFoundException`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/FileNotFoundException.html) when opening the stream or Sanner. But then, **why wasn&#39;t it catched and printed** as error?\r\n 3. So, there must be another issue! Back to (1): assume the `fileChoose` is `null` and as a result the concatenated *pathname* (file-name), too. Then read from the docs of constructors `FileInputStream(String) or FileInputStream(File)`, that it might internally create a [`File` from the *pathname* given as `String`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html#File(java.lang.String)) and see the explanation there:\r\n &gt; **Throws:** `NullPointerException` - If the *pathname* argument is `null`\r\n\r\n----\r\n__Update:__\r\nThanks to [k314159&#39;s comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69919381/java-scanner-not-initializing-in-one-string-even-though-it-does-in-another-one/69919507#comment123599965_69919507) falsifying reasoning on my assumptions:\r\n\r\n* Probable root-cause (2): error is printed on standard out (console), easily overseen when using a GUI.\r\n* Impossible root-cause (3): can&#39;t be because if `fileChoose = null` then concatenated path argument would be `&quot;triviaAnull.txt&quot;`.\r\n\r\n__Explanation:__\r\n* (3) was tested in [null-concatenating demo](https://ideone.com/TeA2zQ). Hence, if invalid path argument passed, this causes a `FileNotFoundException` at line `ls = new FileInputStream(..)` so that observed `ls` NPE could never have been reached. Instead thrown exception must have been catched. Since no return handling was implemented the error prints to console (not shown on GUI) and flow continues with erroneous `ls = null` until observed NPE thrown at `ls.nextLine()`.\r\n\r\n* So (2) must be the most-probable root-cause. However the `FileNotFoundException` could have been caused by `fileChoose = null` or any other invalid path passed to construct the Scanner instance.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nYour file-name passed as argument *pathname* to `FileInputStream` constructor &lt;del&gt;was null&lt;/del&gt; &lt;ins&gt;might have been invalid, either&lt;/ins&gt;, because the **`fileChoose` variable was `null`** &lt;ins&gt;or else&lt;/ins&gt;.\r\n\r\nCompare the other **working method `questionPicker(String str)`** where you assign it as `fileChoose = str.toUpperCase();`. If you would pass a `str` as `null` here, then it may also throw a NPE.\r\n\r\n### How to avoid: Validate/test for null inputs\r\nAdd a *guard-statement* (see [Fail-fast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast) principle).\r\nFor example using `Objects.requireNonNull(fileChoose, &quot;answer/question file must not be null&quot;);` where the second is the error-message printed when `fileChoose` is null.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/45632920/why-should-one-use-objects-requirenonnull\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nAs [Bohemian&#39;s answer correctly spotted](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69919754/5730279) the design-issue: \r\n* the sequence and dependency of your statements (`ls` related)\r\n* unusual application of try/catch/finally pattern for I/O-Stream transactions\r\n\r\nIn case those were to roughly outlined, here a complete before/after example with explaining comments.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n```java\r\nString returnee; // consider a default return value to avoid any null at the end\r\n\r\nScanner ls = null; // a null Scanner is useless, consider initializing inside try (local scope is safer)!\r\ntry { // try block can encompass the whole attempt with every dependent statement\r\n    ls = new Scanner(new FileInputStream(&quot;triviaA&quot;+fileChoose+&quot;.txt&quot;)); // test filename at least for non-null, before try block!\r\n} catch(FileNotFoundException z) { //\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Error 004: File retrieve failed.&quot;); // perfect to log\r\n    // but how to handle: return or assign returnee with a default \r\n}\r\n\r\nskipLines(ls, question); // depends on ls, so put inside try-block\r\nreturnee = ls.nextLine(); // depends on ls, so put inside try-block\r\n\r\nls.close(); // safe resources: close inside finally-block!\r\n\r\nreturn returnee; // what if this is (still) null\r\n```\r\n\r\nIncorporating the second outlined pattern from Bohemian:\r\n* everything inside try-catch-finally block\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n```java\r\n// default return\r\nString returnee = &quot;&quot;; // default return value\r\n\r\n// guard-statement with fail-fast\r\nif (fileChoose == null) {\r\n   return returnee; // returns the default or throw\r\n}\r\n\r\nString filename = &quot;triviaA&quot;+fileChoose+&quot;.txt&quot;; // can not fail, because validated before. Worst case, e.g. least &quot;triviaA.txt&quot;\r\n\r\ntry { // block of ls dependent statements\r\n\r\n   Scanner ls = new Scanner(new FileInputStream(filename)); // filename not-null\r\n   skipLines(ls, question); // safer, because in local/try scope\r\n   returnee = ls.nextLine(); // safer, but may throw NoSuchElementException\r\n\r\n} catch(FileNotFoundException notFound) { //\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Error 004: File retrieve failed: &quot; + notFound.getMessage()); // perfect to log\r\n    // but how to handle: return or assign returnee with a default \r\n} catch(NoSuchElementException noElement)\r\n    // log\r\n    // and handle!\r\n} finally {\r\n    if (ls != null) ls.close(); // always close (if not null)\r\n}\r\n\r\nreturn returnee; // Avoid null, at least a default. Benefit: no NPE-risk for the caller.\r\n```\r\nSee also: What [`Sanner.nextLine()` might throw](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html#nextLine--)","title":"Java Scanner not initializing in one string() even though it does in another one","body":"<p>Invest in debugging NullPointerExceptions (also known as NPE).

Then read from the docs of constructors <code>FileInputStream(String) or FileInputStream(File)</code>, that it might internally create a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html#File(java.lang.String)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>File</code> from the <em>pathname</em> given as <code>String</code></a> and see the explanation there:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Throws:</strong> <code>NullPointerException</code> - If the <em>pathname</em> argument is <code>null</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Update:</strong>\nThanks to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69919381/java-scanner-not-initializing-in-one-string-even-though-it-does-in-another-one/69919507#comment123599965_69919507\">k314159's comment</a> falsifying reasoning on my assumptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Probable root-cause (2): error is printed on standard out (console), easily overseen when using a GUI.</li>\n<li>Impossible root-cause (3): can't be because if <code>fileChoose = null</code> then concatenated path argument would be <code>&quot;triviaAnull.txt&quot;</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>(3) was tested in <a href=\"https://ideone.com/TeA2zQ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">null-concatenating demo</a>. Hence, if invalid path argument passed, this causes a <code>FileNotFoundException</code> at line <code>ls = new FileInputStream(..)</code> so that observed <code>ls</code> NPE could never have been reached. Instead thrown exception must have been catched. Since no return handling was implemented the error prints to console (not shown on GUI) and flow continues with erroneous <code>ls = null</code> until observed NPE thrown at <code>ls.nextLine()</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>So (2) must be the most-probable root-cause. However the <code>FileNotFoundException</code> could have been caused by <code>fileChoose = null</code> or any other invalid path passed to construct the Scanner instance.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Your file-name passed as argument <em>pathname</em> to <code>FileInputStream</code> constructor <del>was null</del> might have been invalid, either, because the <strong><code>fileChoose</code> variable was <code>null</code></strong> or else.</p>\n<p>Compare the other <strong>working method <code>questionPicker(String str)</code></strong> where you assign it as <code>fileChoose = str.toUpperCase();</code>. If you would pass a <code>str</code> as <code>null</code> here, then it may also throw a NPE.</p>\n<h3>How to avoid: Validate/test for null inputs</h3>\n<p>Add a <em>guard-statement</em> (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Fail-fast</a> principle).\nFor example using <code>Objects.requireNonNull(fileChoose, &quot;answer/question file must not be null&quot;);</code> where the second is the error-message printed when <code>fileChoose</code> is null.</p>\n<p>See also:\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45632920/why-should-one-use-objects-requirenonnull\">Why should one use Objects.requireNonNull()?</a></p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/69919754/5730279\">Bohemian's answer correctly spotted</a> the design-issue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the sequence and dependency of your statements (<code>ls</code> related)</li>\n<li>unusual application of try/catch/finally pattern for I/O-Stream transactions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In case those were to roughly outlined, here a complete before/after example with explaining comments.</p>\n<p><strong>Before:</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>String returnee; // consider a default return value to avoid any null at the end\n\nScanner ls = null; // a null Scanner is useless, consider initializing inside try (local scope is safer)!\ntry { // try block can encompass the whole attempt with every dependent statement\n    ls = new Scanner(new FileInputStream(&quot;triviaA&quot;+fileChoose+&quot;.txt&quot;)); // test filename at least for non-null, before try block!\n} catch(FileNotFoundException z) { //\n    System.out.println(&quot;Error 004: File retrieve failed.&quot;); // perfect to log\n    // but how to handle: return or assign returnee with a default \n}\n\nskipLines(ls, question); // depends on ls, so put inside try-block\nreturnee = ls.nextLine(); // depends on ls, so put inside try-block\n\nls.close(); // safe resources: close inside finally-block!\n\nreturn returnee; // what if this is (still) null\n</code></pre>\n<p>Incorporating the second outlined pattern from Bohemian:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>everything inside try-catch-finally block</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>After:</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>// default return\nString returnee = &quot;&quot;; // default return value\n\n// guard-statement with fail-fast\nif (fileChoose == null) {\n   return returnee; // returns the default or throw\n}\n\nString filename = &quot;triviaA&quot;+fileChoose+&quot;.txt&quot;; // can not fail, because validated before.

href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7K2Yp.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">compilation snap-2</a> I'm trying to upgrade my project from java 1.8 to version 13.0.2. There were some unsupported functions which I removed. Unfortunately <strong>toInstant()</strong> is one of them.\nMy project uses it in a java module like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Date date = format.parse(inputDate);\nfinalDate = date.toInstant().toString();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now I'm not able to compile the code with toInstant() with JDK 13 because it says 'Symbol not found' and compilation error occurs:</p>\n<pre><code>[ERROR]   cannot find symbol\n[ERROR]   symbol:   method toInstant()\n[ERROR]   location: variable date of type java.util.Date\n[ERROR] -&gt; [Help 1]\n</code></pre>\n<p>So I looked out for several code replacements for toInstant() and decided to get rid of it by using few functions from java.time. But java.time is not found during compilation:</p>\n<pre><code>package java.time does not exist\n</code></pre>\n<p>Does this denote that something is wrong with my JDK set up ? I'm not facing any other issues apart from this one issue.\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WX2c9.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">error snapshot</a></p>\n<p>Compilation

The class given is named in plural: `Attacks` (ending with `s`!). \r\n* Syntax-Error: to call a constructor with `new` (forgot that keyword!) simply pass a variable like `myDamage` (no `int` as type-declaration needed!)\r\n* Constructor not found: the constructor of `Attack` requires currently 2 arguments: `int damage` and `Effects effects`. But you only passed the first.\r\n* Type-Error: the `new Attack` object can not be multiplied with a double like `1.5`\r\n\r\nNot sure if `packag.CustomDecks.cSet` is correct.\r\n\r\n### Fix the syntax errors\r\nTo fix it, you could correct like that:\r\n```java\r\nint myDamage = 10;\r\nif (card.getEffects() == Cards.Effects.Block_Break) {\r\n    // prefix with new, int multiplication, pass 2nd param\r\n    packag.CustomDecks.cSet = new Attack(myDamage * 2, Cards.Effects.Block_Break); // will init damage with 20\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr - with the new constructor from above - you can make use of the effect passed in:\r\n```java\r\npackag.CustomDecks.cSet = new Attack(damage, card.getEffects()); // *1.5: is done inside using factor bound to current effect \r\n```\r\nNote: No if is needed then. The factor is constantly pulled from current effect.\r\n\r\n## Naming Convention commonly used in Java\r\n**Class Names:**\r\n\r\nUsually classes in Java are named in singular, unless they are collections containing many items. \r\n\r\n**Enums:**\r\n\r\nAlso the enum class would be named `Effect` (singular) by convention. Because an enum defines a set of constants. But an enum variable like the field in your class `Attacks` represents a single state and value, for example the state `Block_Break`.\r\n\r\nThe enum-values are usually written in uppercase with underscores separating words like `BLOCK_BREAK`.

Return <code>Food</code> items when a selection is made, and test for food type using the <code>FoodType</code> enum.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2888638,"reputation":10719,"user_id":2477916,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Java Devil"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1373860072,"creation_date":1373860072,"answer_id":17646469,"question_id":17646335,"body_markdown":"You could use `Object` instead of explicitly using `Fruit` or `Vegetables`\r\n\r\n    public static Object getEnum(String name) \r\n    {    \r\n        for(Fruits fruit: Fruits.values()) \r\n        {\r\n            if(name.equals(fruit.getName())) \r\n            {\r\n                  return fruit;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        for(Vegetables vege: Vegetables.values()) \r\n        {\r\n            if(name.equals(Vegetables.getName())) \r\n            {\r\n                  return vege;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n      return null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nDownside of this however is that you will then have to compare and cast the result to what you want\r\n\r\n    Object o = getEnum(&quot;Carrot&quot;)\r\n    if(o instanceof Vegetable)\r\n    {\r\n         Vegetable v = (Vegetable)o;\r\n         v.getName();\r\n    }\r\n    //.. and again for fruit","title":"Combining enums and using getter to return a specified enum","body":"<p>You could use <code>Object</code> instead of explicitly using <code>Fruit</code> or <code>Vegetables</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>public static Object getEnum(String name) \n{    \n    for(Fruits fruit: Fruits.values()) \n    {\n        if(name.equals(fruit.getName())) \n        {\n              return fruit;\n        }\n    }\n    for(Vegetables vege: Vegetables.values()) \n    {\n        if(name.equals(Vegetables.getName())) \n        {\n              return vege;\n        }\n    }\n  return null;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Downside of this however is that you will then have to compare and cast the result to what you want</p>\n\n<pre><code>Object o = getEnum(\"Carrot\")\nif(o instanceof Vegetable)\n{\n     Vegetable v = (Vegetable)o;\n     v.getName();\n}\n//.. and again for fruit\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":8539,"reputation":14603,"user_id":15461,"accept_rate":71,"display_name":"husayt"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":20,"is_accepted":false,"score":20,"last_activity_date":1405513832,"creation_date":1383605412,"answer_id":19778800,"question_id":17646335,"body_markdown":"Here is another demonstration of what you&#39;re looking for.
