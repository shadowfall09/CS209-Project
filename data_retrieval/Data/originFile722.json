The same happens e.g. with `---`.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m setting up my parser and HTML renderer like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nMutableDataHolder parserOptions = new MutableDataSet()\r\n    //emoji; see https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/\r\n    .set(EmojiExtension.USE_IMAGE_TYPE, EmojiImageType.UNICODE_ONLY)\r\n    //GFM tables\r\n    .set(TablesExtension.COLUMN_SPANS, false).set(TablesExtension.APPEND_MISSING_COLUMNS, true).set(TablesExtension.DISCARD_EXTRA_COLUMNS, true)\r\n    .set(TablesExtension.HEADER_SEPARATOR_COLUMN_MATCH, true)\r\n    //extensions\r\n    .set(Parser.EXTENSIONS, List.of(DefinitionExtension.create(), EmojiExtension.create(), SuperscriptExtension.create(), TablesExtension.create(),\r\n        TypographicExtension.create(), YamlFrontMatterExtension.create()));\r\nparser = Parser.builder(parserOptions).build();\r\nhtmlRenderer = HtmlRenderer.builder().build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that I just use `TypographicExtension.create()`. Maybe there are further configurations to do, but by default I wouldn&#39;t expect the extension just to drop characters.\r\n\r\nI use the parser like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ncom.vladsch.flexmark.util.ast.Document markdownDocument = parser.parse(&quot;it&#39;s working&quot;);\r\nSystem.out.println(htmlRenderer.render(markdownDocument));\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expect:\r\n\r\n&gt; `&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s working&lt;/p&gt;`\r\n\r\nInstead I get:\r\n\r\n&gt; `&lt;p&gt;its working&lt;/p&gt;`\r\n\r\nI tried mucking with the settings, using a literal character instead of a character reference:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n.set(TypographicExtension.ENABLE_QUOTES, true)\r\n.set(TypographicExtension.SINGLE_QUOTE_UNMATCHED, &quot;x&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNothing changed. The character still simply disappeared\r\n\r\nHowever I was able to _disable quote processing altogether_:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n.set(TypographicExtension.ENABLE_QUOTES, false)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I got my original string back.

onActivity since Activity has been destroyed already\r\n```\r\nin the `checkUser` body.\r\nSo I tossed in a \r\n```kotlin\r\nassertThat { mainActivityRule.scenario.state }.isEqualTo(STARTED)\r\n```\r\nas the very first statement in `login_setsUser`...\r\n\r\nWhich also fails because\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected:&lt;S[TARTED]&gt; but was:&lt;S[uccess(DESTROYED)]&gt;\r\n```\r\nNow the fact that it&#39;s `Success(DESTROYED)` rather than `DESTROYED` tells me I&#39;m using the state wrong anyway, but what I&#39;m more concerned with is that it *does* say `DESTROYED`right at the very beginning of the test.\r\n\r\nSo why is the activity being destroyed and how do I keep it alive?\r\n\r\nThe logs, for howevermuch they&#39;re

I&#39;ve recently come into a lot of confusion regarding the standard procedure of connecting to a database. \r\n\r\nFrom what I understand, I should create one instance of a Connection object, then I should pass this instance around the project until the end of the entire program. \r\n\r\n```Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password); ```\r\n \r\nIf the statement above is true then I only need to call the previous line once in the entire program and pass the connection variable around the entire program whenever I need to connect to the database. If this is true, how can I pass around this instance of connection from one controller class to another? \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I am seeing that it is a standard procedure (in order to maximize GUI responsiveness) to push all &quot;costly&quot; procedures onto another thread (not the main one that is handling the GUI) using the javafx.concurrencies library. If this statement is true, is it also true that I should push all methods that interact with the database into say a ```Task&lt;V&gt;``` class? \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUp until now, I created multiple object classes that each communicate with the database. In addition, I created a Database class that allows me to initialize a &quot;new&quot; connection to the database. For example,\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Database {\r\n\r\n    public static Connection createConnectionToDB() throws SQLException{       \r\n        Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password); \r\n        return connection;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nNow in the various object classes, when I need to add, update, or delete some data from the database, I created an add, update, and delete method in each object to handle that object&#39;s data in the database. However, for each method, I thought (from my natural naivete) that it would be standard to first create a connection to the database via the previous ```Connection connection = createConnectionToDB()``` method in the Database class then to use this connection instance to do what needs to be done, then close the connection with the ```connection.close()``` method.     \r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Object{\r\n\r\n     add(){\r\n          Connection connection = Database.createConnectionToDB();\r\n          PreparedStatement statement = ...\r\n          // some other lines \r\n          connection.close();\r\n     }\r\n     \r\n     update(){\r\n          Connection connection = Database.createConnectionToDB();\r\n          PreparedStatement statement = ...\r\n          // some other lines \r\n          connection.close();\r\n     }\r\n     \r\n     delete(){\r\n          Connection connection = Database.createConnectionToDB();\r\n          PreparedStatement statement = ...\r\n          // some other lines \r\n          connection.close();\r\n     }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, for each object, and each method for each object, a new connection is created and closed. Is this bad practice?

I've recently come into a lot of confusion regarding the standard procedure of connecting to a database.</p>\n<p>From what I understand, I should create one instance of a Connection object, then I should pass this instance around the project until the end of the entire program.</p>\n<p><code>Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password); </code></p>\n<p>If the statement above is true then I only need to call the previous line once in the entire program and pass the connection variable around the entire program whenever I need to connect to the database. If this is true, how can I pass around this instance of connection from one controller class to another?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Furthermore, I am seeing that it is a standard procedure (in order to maximize GUI responsiveness) to push all &quot;costly&quot; procedures onto another thread (not the main one that is handling the GUI) using the javafx.concurrencies library. If this statement is true, is it also true that I should push all methods that interact with the database into say a <code>Task&lt;V&gt;</code> class?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Up until now, I created multiple object classes that each communicate with the database. In addition, I created a Database class that allows me to initialize a &quot;new&quot; connection to the database. For example,</p>\n<pre><code>public class Database {\n\n    public static Connection createConnectionToDB() throws SQLException{       \n        Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password); \n        return connection;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now in the various object classes, when I need to add, update, or delete some data from the database, I created an add, update, and delete method in each object to handle that object's data in the database. However, for each method, I thought (from my natural naivete) that it would be standard to first create a connection to the database via the previous <code>Connection connection = createConnectionToDB()</code> method in the Database class then to use this connection instance to do what needs to be done, then close the connection with the <code>connection.close()</code> method.</p>\n<p>For example,</p>\n<pre><code>public class Object{\n\n     add(){\n          Connection connection = Database.createConnectionToDB();\n          PreparedStatement statement = ...\n          // some other lines \n          connection.close();\n     }\n     \n     update(){\n          Connection connection = Database.createConnectionToDB();\n          PreparedStatement statement = ...\n          // some other lines \n          connection.close();\n     }\n     \n     delete(){\n          Connection connection = Database.createConnectionToDB();\n          PreparedStatement statement = ...\n          // some other lines \n          connection.close();\n     }\n\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>That is, for each object, and each method for each object, a new connection is created and closed. Is this bad practice?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","comparator"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":238684,"reputation":22543,"user_id":507738,"accept_rate":71,"display_name":"MC Emperor"},"score":0,"creation_date":1547674723,"post_id":54224267,"comment_id":95277448,"body_markdown":"Note that you are comparing strings with `==`.

If you really need a collection that you can modify, you should instead write your function so that it populates a mutable list that you pass to it as a parameter, so it is evident that you, as the owner of the mutable list, are free to further modify the list after the function returns.</li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3550933,"reputation":2243,"user_id":2965839,"accept_rate":88,"display_name":"Kiki"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1478767849,"creation_date":1423475752,"answer_id":28406982,"question_id":28406921,"body_markdown":"Try it like this:\r\n\r\n    public List&lt;Lookup&gt; findAll(String lang) {\r\n\t\tList&lt;Lookup&gt; result = new ArrayList&lt;Lookup&gt;();\r\n        Query query = entityManager.createNamedQuery(&quot;Lookup.findAll&quot;);\r\n        if (isValidLang(lang)) {\r\n            query.setParameter(&quot;lang&quot;, lang);\r\n\t\t\tresult = query.getResultList();\r\n        }\r\n\t\treturn result;\r\n    }","title":"Java return an empty list","body":"<p>Try it like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public List&lt;Lookup&gt; findAll(String lang) {\n    List&lt;Lookup&gt; result = new ArrayList&lt;Lookup&gt;();\n    Query query = entityManager.createNamedQuery(\"Lookup.findAll\");\n    if (isValidLang(lang)) {\n        query.setParameter(\"lang\", lang);\n        result = query.getResultList();\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1293741,"reputation":4913,"user_id":1245337,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"atish shimpi"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":13,"is_accepted":false,"score":12,"last_activity_date":1423476402,"creation_date":1423475918,"answer_id":28407040,"question_id":28406921,"body_markdown":"`Collections.emptyList()` returns an ***immutable list***, i.e., a list to *which you cannot add elements* if you want to perform any operation on your list, then create new instance of list and return it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    if (isValidLang(lang)) {\r\n            query.setParameter(&quot;lang&quot;, lang);\r\n            return query.getResultList();\r\n        } else {\r\n            return new ArrayList&lt;Lookup&gt;();  // return array list instance.\r\n        }","title":"Java return an empty list","body":"<p><code>Collections.emptyList()</code> returns an <strong><em>immutable list</em></strong>, i.e., a list to <em>which you cannot add elements</em> if you want to perform any operation on your list, then create new instance of list and return it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (isValidLang(lang)) {\n        query.setParameter(\"lang\", lang);\n        return query.getResultList();\n    } else {\n        return new ArrayList&lt;Lookup&gt;();  // return array list instance.\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3577678,"reputation":11003,"user_id":2986537,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Razib"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1423515467,"creation_date":1423515467,"answer_id":28419207,"question_id":28406921,"body_markdown":"Using `ternary operator (boolean_expression ? statement1 : statemetn2 )` in `java` we can check every return type whether it is `null`.
