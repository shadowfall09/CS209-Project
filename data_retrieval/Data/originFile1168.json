It creates and find the entities but these are quickly detached because of the `em.close()` instruction. So every data the JSF app handles is always detached. Nothing is managed.\r\nBelow is `persistence.xml`\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n    &lt;persistence version=&quot;2.1&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence&quot; xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_1.xsd&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;persistence-unit name=&quot;ar.org.ptpchaco_SICasosTierras_war_1.0PU&quot; transaction-type=&quot;JTA&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;provider&gt;org.hibernate.ejb.HibernatePersistence&lt;/provider&gt;\r\n        &lt;jta-data-source&gt;java:/JNDICasosTierras&lt;/jta-data-source&gt;\r\n       \r\n        &lt;class&gt;ar.org.ptpchaco.siconflictostierras.storage.EntityTest&lt;/class&gt;\r\n        &lt;class&gt;ar.org.ptpchaco.siconflictostierras.storage.EntityTestChild&lt;/class&gt;\r\n        &lt;exclude-unlisted-classes&gt;true&lt;/exclude-unlisted-classes&gt;\r\n        &lt;properties&gt;\r\n          &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto&quot; value=&quot;update&quot;/&gt;\r\n          &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.show_sql&quot; value=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;\r\n          &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.generate_statistics&quot; value=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;\r\n          &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.enable_lazy_load_no_trans&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;\r\n        &lt;/properties&gt;\r\n      &lt;/persistence-unit&gt;\r\n    &lt;/persistence&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nSo my logic is as following. I first create a parent entity, and `persist` it. The instance get an ID. the JPA controller executes the transaction and flushes into the database (MySQL). MySQL inserts the row in the table. Fine.\r\n\r\nThen I want to add a child to the parent entity. So I create the child, `persist` it. It receives and id. I add it to the `SortedSet` of the parent entity. And then try to `merge` the parent entity, for updating the SortedSet of child entities. That is done with the addChild() method.\r\n\r\nMy problem is. I load the page. Select any parent entity. Add a child, fine. Add a second child.

I first create a parent entity, and <code>persist</code> it. The instance get an ID. the JPA controller executes the transaction and flushes into the database (MySQL). MySQL inserts the row in the table. Fine.</p>\n<p>Then I want to add a child to the parent entity. So I create the child, <code>persist</code> it. It receives and id. I add it to the <code>SortedSet</code> of the parent entity. And then try to <code>merge</code> the parent entity, for updating the SortedSet of child entities. That is done with the addChild() method.</p>\n<p>My problem is. I load the page. Select any parent entity. Add a child, fine. Add a second child.

Brobot wraps Sikuli methods and uses Sikuli variables such as Match in its core functionality. Its color methods depend heavily on matrix operations with OpenCV. The [Brobot documentation][docs] gives more detailed information on the framework. Additionally, there is a page in the documentation specifically for [color searches][color-doc].\r\n\r\n  [docs]: https://jspinak.github.io/brobot/  \r\n  [color-doc]: https://jspinak.github.io/brobot/docs/introduction/finding-objects/using-color  \r\n\r\n# Color Selection Methods #  \r\nThere are 3 methods used to identify which colors to search for.  \r\n1.\t**Color averaging**. The average color of all pixels is determined from all image files (a single Brobot image can contain multiple image files). The range of acceptable colors around the target color can be adjusted, as well as the required size of the color region.\r\n2.\t**K-Means**. Images that contain a variety of colors are not suitable to color averaging. The k-Means method from OpenCV finds the salient colors in an image, which are then used in the search. Adjustable options include the number of k-Means, acceptable color range, and required size.\r\n3.\t**Histogram**. Brobot divides images into 5 regions (4 corners + the middle region) in order to preserve some spatial color characteristics (for example, blue sky on the top of an image will not match blue sea on the bottom of an image). The search can be adjusted by color range, as well as the number of histogram bins for hue, saturation, and value.  \r\n\r\n# Chained Find Operations #  \r\nEach of these color methods can be used independently or combined with the traditional Sikuli pattern searches by chaining find operations together. There are two main flavors of chained find operations:\r\n1.\t**Nested finds**. Matches are searched for inside the matches from the previous find operation. The last find operation is responsible for providing the function’s return value. \r\n2.\t**Confirmed finds**. The matches from the first find operation are filtered by the results of following find operations. The later find operations act as confirmation or rejection of the initial matches. Confirmed matches from the first find operation are returned.  \r\n\r\n[Documentation for nested finds and confirmed finds][chained] \r\n\r\n  [chained]: https://jspinak.github.io/brobot/docs/introduction/finding-objects/combining-finds \r\n\r\n# Finding the Red Image #  \r\nFor your specific question, it would be best to use a chain of two find operations, set up as a _confirmed find_. The first operation would be a pattern search (equivalent to findAll in Sikuli) and the second operation, the confirmation operation, would be a color search.  \r\n\r\nActions in Brobot are built with:  \r\n1.\tThe action configuration (an ActionOptions variable)\r\n2.\tThe objects to act on (images, regions, locations, etc.)  \r\n\r\nBrobot encourages defining states with a collection of images that belong together. The code below assumes you have a state StateWithRedImage that contains the image RedImage. The results are returned in a Matches object, which contains information about the matches and the action performed.   \r\n \r\n```\r\npublic class RedImageFinder {\r\n\r\n    private final Action action;\r\n    private final StateWithRedImage stateWithRedImage;\r\n\r\n    public RedImageFinder(Action action, StateWithRedImage stateWithRedImage) {\r\n        this.action = action;\r\n        this.stateWithRedImage = stateWithRedImage;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public Matches find() {\r\n        ActionOptions actionOptions = new ActionOptions.Builder()\r\n                .setAction(ActionOptions.Action.FIND)\r\n                .setFind(ActionOptions.Find.ALL)\r\n                .addFind(ActionOptions.Find.COLOR)\r\n                .keepLargerMatches(true)\r\n                .build();\r\n        return action.perform(actionOptions, stateWithRedImage.getRedImage());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Disclaimer_: I&#39;m the developer of Brobot.

There are two main flavors of chained find operations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Nested finds</strong>. Matches are searched for inside the matches from the previous find operation. The last find operation is responsible for providing the function’s return value.</li>\n<li><strong>Confirmed finds</strong>. The matches from the first find operation are filtered by the results of following find operations. The later find operations act as confirmation or rejection of the initial matches. Confirmed matches from the first find operation are returned.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://jspinak.github.io/brobot/docs/introduction/finding-objects/combining-finds\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Documentation for nested finds and confirmed finds</a></p>\n<h1>Finding the Red Image</h1>\n<p>For your specific question, it would be best to use a chain of two find operations, set up as a <em>confirmed find</em>. The first operation would be a pattern search (equivalent to findAll in Sikuli) and the second operation, the confirmation operation, would be a color search.</p>\n<p>Actions in Brobot are built with:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The action configuration (an ActionOptions variable)</li>\n<li>The objects to act on (images, regions, locations, etc.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Brobot encourages defining states with a collection of images that belong together. The code below assumes you have a state StateWithRedImage that contains the image RedImage. The results are returned in a Matches object, which contains information about the matches and the action performed.</p>\n<pre><code>public class RedImageFinder {\n\n    private final Action action;\n    private final StateWithRedImage stateWithRedImage;\n\n    public RedImageFinder(Action action, StateWithRedImage stateWithRedImage) {\n        this.action = action;\n        this.stateWithRedImage = stateWithRedImage;\n    }\n\n    public Matches find() {\n        ActionOptions actionOptions = new ActionOptions.Builder()\n                .setAction(ActionOptions.Action.FIND)\n                .setFind(ActionOptions.Find.ALL)\n                .addFind(ActionOptions.Find.COLOR)\n                .keepLargerMatches(true)\n                .build();\n        return action.perform(actionOptions, stateWithRedImage.getRedImage());\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: I'm the developer of Brobot.

Discussion of C++ more or less implies discussion of C casts as well, and that gives (more or less) a fourth answer.\r\n\r\nSince it&#39;s the one you didn&#39;t mention explicitly, I&#39;ll start with C. C casts have a number of problems. One is that they can do any of a number of different things. In some cases, the cast does nothing more than tell the compiler (in essence): &quot;shut up, I know what I&#39;m doing&quot; -- i.e., it ensures that even when you do a conversion that could cause problems, the compiler won&#39;t warn you about those potential problems. Just for example, `char a=(char)123456;`. The exact result of this implementation defined (depends on the size and signedness of `char`), and except in rather strange situations, probably isn&#39;t useful. C casts also vary in whether they&#39;re something that happens only at compile time (i.e., you&#39;re just telling the compiler how to interpret/treat some data) or something that happens at run time (e.g., an actual conversion from double to long).\r\n\r\nC++ attempts to deal with that to at least some extent by adding a number of &quot;new&quot; cast operators, each of which is restricted to only a subset of the capabilities of a C cast. This makes it more difficult to (for example) accidentally do a conversion you really didn&#39;t intend -- if you *only* intend to cast away constness on an object, you can use `const_cast`, and be sure that the *only* thing it can affect is whether an object is `const`, `volatile`, or not. Conversely, a `static_cast` is not allowed to affect whether an object is `const` or `volatile`. In short, you have most of the same types of capabilities, but they&#39;re categorized so one cast can generally only do one kind of conversion, where a single C-style cast can do two or three conversions in one operation. The primary exception is that you *can* use a `dynamic_cast` in place of a `static_cast` in at least some cases and despite being written as a `dynamic_cast`, it&#39;ll really end up as a `static_cast`. For example, you can use `dynamic_cast` to traverse up or down a class hierarchy -- but a cast &quot;up&quot; the hierarchy is always safe, so it can be done statically, while a cast &quot;down&quot; the hierarchy isn&#39;t necessarily safe so it&#39;s done dynamically.\r\n\r\nJava and C# are much more similar to each other. In particular, with both of them casting is (virtually?) always a run-time operation. In terms of the C++ cast operators, it&#39;s usually closest to a `dynamic_cast` in terms of what&#39;s really done -- i.e., when you attempt to cast an object to some target type, the compiler inserts a run-time check to see whether that conversion is allowed, and throw an exception if it&#39;s not. The exact details (e.g., the name used for the &quot;bad cast&quot; exception) varies, but the basic principle remains mostly similar (though, if memory serves, Java does make casts applied to the few non-object types like `int` much closer to C casts -- but these types are used rarely enough that 1) I don&#39;t remember that for sure, and 2) even if it&#39;s true, it doesn&#39;t matter much anyway).\r\n\r\nLooking at things more generally, the situation&#39;s pretty simple (at least IMO): a cast (obviously enough) means you&#39;re converting something from one type to another. When/if you do that, it raises the question &quot;Why?&quot; If you really want something to be a particular type, why didn&#39;t you define it to be that type to start with? That&#39;s not to say there&#39;s *never* a reason to do such a conversion, but anytime it happens, it should prompt the question of whether you could re-design the code so the correct type was used throughout. Even seemingly innocuous conversions (e.g., between integer and floating point) should be examined much more closely than is common. Despite their *seeming* similarity, integers should really be used for &quot;counted&quot; types of things and floating point for &quot;measured&quot; kinds of things. Ignoring the distinction is what leads to some of the crazy statements like &quot;the average American family has 1.8 children.&quot; Even though we can all see how that happens, the fact is that *no* family has 1.8 children.

Is possible to overcome this <em>issue</em>?</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I set <code>-cp</code> using the code below:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>List&lt;String&gt; optionList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();\noptionList.add(&quot;-cp&quot;);\noptionList.add(System.getProperty(&quot;java.class.path&quot;));\n</code></pre>\n<p>When running in IDE <code>System.getProperty(&quot;java.class.path&quot;)</code> returns the whole classpath including third-party jars, however, when running from Sbt there is only one jar in classpath: <code>C:\\Users\\PliashkouRaman\\AppData\\Roaming\\JetBrains\\IdeaIC2022.1\\plugins\\Scala\\launcher\\sbt-launch.jar</code></p>\n<p>I hardcoded a list of jars and now the test is passing.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","gradle"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":31011,"reputation":122006,"user_id":84889,"display_name":"Peter Niederwieser"},"score":1,"creation_date":1399492896,"post_id":23523831,"comment_id":36090158,"body_markdown":"Without a way to reproduce, this will be hard to diagnose remotely.

If needed you can include the CDATA marker to keep the XML valid.\r\n\r\nThe plugin does expose the entire `MavenProject` model and a logger, that should cover most needs. It gives access to all the project information, properties and the build environment. The following variables are bound by default for that purpose:\r\n- `project` as [org.apache.maven.project.MavenProject](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.3.9/apidocs/org/apache/maven/project/MavenProject.html)\r\n- `log` as [org.apache.maven.plugin.logging.Log](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.3.9/maven-plugin-api/apidocs/org/apache/maven/plugin/logging/Log.html)\r\n\r\nIn my case i used `Beanshell`, and the plugin setup looks like this:\r\n```xml\r\n &lt;!-- Scripting Plugin: run ScriptEngine compatible scripts --&gt;\r\n&lt;plugin&gt;\r\n\t&lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t&lt;artifactId&gt;maven-scripting-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t&lt;version&gt;3.0.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n\t&lt;executions&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;execution&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;id&gt;run-script&lt;/id&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;phase&gt;compile&lt;/phase&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;goals&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;goal&gt;eval&lt;/goal&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;/goals&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/execution&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/executions&gt;\r\n\t&lt;configuration&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;engineName&gt;beanshell&lt;/engineName&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;!-- &lt;scriptFile&gt;use this when possible; no code in the POM is preferred&lt;/scriptFile&gt; --&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;script&gt;\r\n\t\t\tlog.info(&quot;Hello from &quot; + project.getArtifact());\r\n\t\t&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n\t&lt;dependencies&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;!-- Script Engine: Beanshell --&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;org.apache-extras.beanshell&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;bsh&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;version&gt;2.0b6&lt;/version&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/dependencies&gt;\r\n&lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n```\r\nYou can use any `id` and `phase` you like in the `execution` element.\r\n\r\nBy changing the `dependency` and `engineName` you can use any other compatible scripting language.\r\n\r\nThis gives the following output in the maven build log:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] --- maven-scripting-plugin:3.0.0:eval (run-script) @ tests ---\r\n[INFO] Hello from local:tests:jar:1.0\r\n```","title":"scripting in Maven to set project properties","body":"<p>I see you found the <code>nashorn-maven-plugin</code> to run Javascript.

The user has the option to swipe to dismiss a news, if they don&#39;t want it in the list or they can also drag and drop it, for example, if they want to see some news on top of others.\r\nEach item in the list is represented programmatically as a Sport.java object. \r\n\r\nI want to retain the state of the list upon device orientation changes.\r\n\r\n**What I&#39;ve tried:-**\r\n\r\nFor the list, I have an arraylist of sport objects (ArrayList&lt;Sport&gt;). I learned that to save a list of custom objects, they objects themselves need to be _Parcelable_. For this, I implemented the Parcelable.java interface like this:\r\n```java\r\npackage com.example.android.materialme;\r\n\r\nimport android.os.Parcel;\r\nimport android.os.Parcelable;\r\n\r\nimport androidx.annotation.NonNull;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Data model for each row of the RecyclerView.\r\n */\r\nclass Sport implements Parcelable {\r\n\r\n    //Member variables representing the title and information about the sport\r\n    private String title;\r\n    private String info;\r\n    private String detail;\r\n    private final int imageResource;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Constructor for the Sport data model\r\n     * @param title The name if the sport.\r\n     * @param info Information about the sport.\r\n     */\r\n    Sport(String title, String info, String detail, int imageResource) {\r\n        this.title = title;\r\n        this.info = info;\r\n        this.detail = detail;\r\n        this.imageResource = imageResource;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    protected Sport(@NonNull Parcel in) {\r\n        title = in.readString();\r\n        info = in.readString();\r\n        detail = in.readString();\r\n        imageResource = in.readInt();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static final Creator&lt;Sport&gt; CREATOR = new Creator&lt;Sport&gt;() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public Sport createFromParcel(Parcel in) {\r\n            return new Sport(in);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public Sport[] newArray(int size) {\r\n            return new Sport[size];\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    String getTitle() {\r\n        return title;\r\n    }\r\n  \r\n    String getInfo() {\r\n        return info;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    int getImageResource(){\r\n        return imageResource;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    String getDetail(){\r\n        return detail;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int describeContents() {\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void writeToParcel(Parcel parcel, int i) {\r\n        parcel.writeString(title);\r\n        parcel.writeString(info);\r\n        parcel.writeString(detail);\r\n        parcel.writeInt(imageResource);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then I used\r\n```java\r\noutState.putParcelableArrayList(KEY, sportsList);\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut, this doesn&#39;t work. The screen is just blank upon rotating device. \r\n\r\nI tried debugging the app and found that the arraylist was being passed correctly with the data intact, it&#39;s just that the app is not being able to display it for some reason.\r\n\r\nAlso, the implementation of the fab button is so that it resets the whole list to its initial condition upon click. The fab works normally but if the orientation is changed once, it stops working (app doesn&#39;t crash). Changing the orientation back also doesn&#39;t fix the fab.

Each item contains a sport name and some info. Clicking on it will show the latest news regarding that particular sport. The user has the option to swipe to dismiss a news, if they don't want it in the list or they can also drag and drop it, for example, if they want to see some news on top of others.\nEach item in the list is represented programmatically as a Sport.java object.</p>\n<p>I want to retain the state of the list upon device orientation changes.</p>\n<p><strong>What I've tried:-</strong></p>\n<p>For the list, I have an arraylist of sport objects (ArrayList). I learned that to save a list of custom objects, they objects themselves need to be <em>Parcelable</em>. For this, I implemented the Parcelable.java interface like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>package com.example.android.materialme;\n\nimport android.os.Parcel;\nimport android.os.Parcelable;\n\nimport androidx.annotation.NonNull;\n\n/**\n * Data model for each row of the RecyclerView.\n */\nclass Sport implements Parcelable {\n\n    //Member variables representing the title and information about the sport\n    private String title;\n    private String info;\n    private String detail;\n    private final int imageResource;\n\n    /**\n     * Constructor for the Sport data model\n     * @param title The name if the sport.\n     * @param info Information about the sport.\n     */\n    Sport(String title, String info, String detail, int imageResource) {\n        this.title = title;\n        this.info = info;\n        this.detail = detail;\n        this.imageResource = imageResource;\n    }\n\n    protected Sport(@NonNull Parcel in) {\n        title = in.readString();\n        info = in.readString();\n        detail = in.readString();\n        imageResource = in.readInt();\n    }\n\n    public static final Creator&lt;Sport&gt; CREATOR = new Creator&lt;Sport&gt;() {\n        @Override\n        public Sport createFromParcel(Parcel in) {\n            return new Sport(in);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public Sport[] newArray(int size) {\n            return new Sport[size];\n        }\n    };\n\n    String getTitle() {\n        return title;\n    }\n  \n    String getInfo() {\n        return info;\n    }\n\n    int getImageResource(){\n        return imageResource;\n    }\n\n    String getDetail(){\n        return detail;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int describeContents() {\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void writeToParcel(Parcel parcel, int i) {\n        parcel.writeString(title);\n        parcel.writeString(info);\n        parcel.writeString(detail);\n        parcel.writeInt(imageResource);\n    }\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>and then I used</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>outState.putParcelableArrayList(KEY, sportsList);\n</code></pre>\n<p>but, this doesn't work. The screen is just blank upon rotating device.</p>\n<p>I tried debugging the app and found that the arraylist was being passed correctly with the data intact, it's just that the app is not being able to display it for some reason.</p>\n<p>Also, the implementation of the fab button is so that it resets the whole list to its initial condition upon click. The fab works normally but if the orientation is changed once, it stops working (app doesn't crash). Changing the orientation back also doesn't fix the fab. So, to get the list again for any other test, I have to rerun the entire app.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Complete Code:-</strong></em></p>\n<p>MainActivity.java</p>\n<pre><code>package com.example.android.materialme;\n\nimport android.content.res.TypedArray;\nimport android.os.Bundle;\n\nimport androidx.annotation.NonNull;\nimport androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;\nimport androidx.recyclerview.widget.ItemTouchHelper;\nimport androidx.recyclerview.widget.LinearLayoutManager;\nimport androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView;\n\nimport com.google.android.material.floatingactionbutton.FloatingActionButton;\n\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.Collections;\n\npublic class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n\n    //Member variables\n    private RecyclerView mRecyclerView;\n    private ArrayList&lt;Sport&gt;
