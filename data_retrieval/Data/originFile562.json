The Java BufferedReader never sees the output printed to stdout by Python running inside docker. If run from the terminal directly with the above commandline, result is as expected - the letters &quot;abcdef&quot; appears in the terminal.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","gradle","intellij-idea"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3107277,"reputation":1237,"user_id":2629813,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Akshatha S R"},"score":0,"creation_date":1569214013,"post_id":58055770,"comment_id":102509068,"body_markdown":"why can&#39;t you use spring-tool-suit(sts)?","body":"why can&#39;t you use spring-tool-suit(sts)?"},{"owner":{"account_id":3538058,"reputation":5428,"user_id":2960034,"display_name":"y.bedrov"},"score":0,"creation_date":1569241814,"post_id":58055770,"comment_id":102521345,"body_markdown":"There is no bundled support for Spring boot in Community edition: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html","body":"There is no bundled support for Spring boot in Community edition: <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">jetbrains.com/idea/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":6428583,"reputation":6399,"user_id":4982691,"display_name":"jumping_monkey"},"score":1,"creation_date":1681360403,"post_id":58055770,"comment_id":134044552,"body_markdown":"I don&#39;t understand why IntelliJ is not giving us this feature for free in the Community Edition and **force** us to go to `https://start.spring.io/.` What&#39;s the rationale?

Anything Java makes difficult, you probably shouldn&#39;t be doing.\r\n\r\nThe most common uses of Pair&#39;s in my experience have been multiple return values from a method and as VALUES in a hashmap (often indexed by strings).\r\n\r\nIn the latter case, I recently used a data structure, something like this:\r\n    \r\n    class SumHolder{MyObject trackedObject, double sum};\r\n\r\nThere is your entire &quot;Pair&quot; class, pretty much the same amount of code as a generic &quot;Pair&quot; but with the advantage of descriptive names.  It can be defined in-line right in the method it&#39;s used which will eliminate typical problems with public variables and the like.  In other words, it&#39;s absolutely better than a pair for this usage (due to the named members) and no worse.  \r\n\r\nIf you actually want a &quot;Pair&quot; for the key of a hashmap you are essentially creating a double-key index. I think this may be the one case where a &quot;Pair&quot; is significantly less code.  It&#39;s not really easier because you could have eclipse generate equals/hash on your little data class, but it would be a good deal more code. Here a Pair would be a quick fix, but if you need a double-indexed hash who&#39;s to say you don&#39;t need an n-indexed hash?  The data class solution will scale up, the Pair will not unless you nest them!\r\n\r\nSo the second case, returning from a method, is a bit harder.  Your class needs more visibility (the caller needs to see it too).  You can define it outside the method but inside the class exactly as above.  At that point your method should be able to return a MyClass.SumHolder object.  The caller gets to see the names of the returned objects, not just a &quot;Pair&quot;.  Note again that the &quot;Default&quot; security of package level is pretty good--it&#39;s restrictive enough that you shouldn&#39;t get yourself into too much trouble.  Better than a &quot;Pair&quot; object anyway.\r\n\r\nThe other case I can see a use for Pairs is a public api with return values for callers outside your current package.  For this I&#39;d just create a true object--preferably immutable. Eventually a caller will share this return value and having it mutable could be problematic. This is another case of the Pair object being worse--most pairs cannot be made immutable.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage to all these cases--the java class expands, my sum class needed a second sum and a &quot;Created&quot; flag by the time I was done, I would have had to throw away the Pair and gone with something else, but if the pair made sense, my class with 4 values still makes at least as much sense.","title":"What is the equivalent of the C++ Pair&lt;L,R&gt; in Java?","body":"<p>The answer by @Andreas Krey is actually good.

Better than a \"Pair\" object anyway.</p>\n\n<p>The other case I can see a use for Pairs is a public api with return values for callers outside your current package.  For this I'd just create a true object--preferably immutable. Eventually a caller will share this return value and having it mutable could be problematic. This is another case of the Pair object being worse--most pairs cannot be made immutable.</p>\n\n<p>Another advantage to all these cases--the java class expands, my sum class needed a second sum and a \"Created\" flag by the time I was done, I would have had to throw away the Pair and gone with something else, but if the pair made sense, my class with 4 values still makes at least as much sense.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":179597,"reputation":2025,"user_id":412366,"accept_rate":59,"display_name":"Matt Broekhuis"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1542652107,"creation_date":1542652107,"answer_id":53380628,"question_id":156275,"body_markdown":"another terse lombok implementation\r\n\r\n    import lombok.Value;\r\n    \r\n    @Value(staticConstructor = &quot;of&quot;)\r\n    public class Pair&lt;F, S&gt;

My `app.yaml` file only contained a single line:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nruntime: java11\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Step 2: Add a main entry point class that runs a web server.**\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to do this, but there&#39;s what I did:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage io.happycoding;\r\n\r\nimport java.net.URL;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.annotations.AnnotationConfiguration;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.server.Handler;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.DefaultHandler;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.servlet.DefaultServlet;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.Configuration;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext;\r\nimport org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebInfConfiguration;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Starts up the server, including a DefaultServlet that handles static files,\r\n * and any servlet classes annotated with the @WebServlet annotation.\r\n */\r\npublic class ServerMain {\r\n\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n\r\n    // Create a server that listens on port 8080.\r\n    Server server = new Server(8080);\r\n    WebAppContext webAppContext = new WebAppContext();\r\n    server.setHandler(webAppContext);\r\n\r\n    // Load static content from inside the jar file.\r\n    URL webAppDir =\r\n        ServerMain.class.getClassLoader().getResource(&quot;META-INF/resources&quot;);\r\n    webAppContext.setResourceBase(webAppDir.toURI().toString());\r\n\r\n    // Enable annotations so the server sees classes annotated with @WebServlet.\r\n    webAppContext.setConfigurations(new Configuration[]{ \r\n      new AnnotationConfiguration(),\r\n      new WebInfConfiguration(), \r\n    });\r\n\r\n    // Look for annotations in the classes directory (dev server) and in the\r\n    // jar file (live server)\r\n    webAppContext.setAttribute(\r\n        &quot;org.eclipse.jetty.server.webapp.ContainerIncludeJarPattern&quot;, \r\n        &quot;.*/target/classes/|.*\\\\.jar&quot;);\r\n\r\n    // Handle static resources, e.g. html files.\r\n    webAppContext.addServlet(DefaultServlet.class, &quot;/&quot;);\r\n\r\n    // Start the server! &#128640;\r\n    server.start();\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Server started!&quot;);\r\n\r\n    // Keep the main thread alive while the server is running.\r\n    server.join();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis class uses Jetty to run a web server, and then adds the rest of your code to that web server. This code assumes that everything will be packaged in the same `.jar` file.\r\n\r\n**Step 3: Modify `pom.xml`**\r\n\r\nYour `pom.xml` needs a few things:\r\n\r\n1. Dependencies for the web server you&#39;re running. I used Jetty.\r\n2. Plugins for packaging your code. I chose to package mine as a single uber jar, so I used `maven-resources-plugin` and `maven-shade-plugin`.\r\n3. Plugins for running your code locally. The old `appengine-maven-plugin` does not work for deploying locally, because it still requires `appengine-web.xml` for some reason. Because I chose the uber jar approach, I used `exec-maven-plugin`.\r\n4. The `appengine-maven-plugin` does still work for deploying to the live server, so you still need it for that.\r\n\r\nIf that sounds confusing, you&#39;re right.
