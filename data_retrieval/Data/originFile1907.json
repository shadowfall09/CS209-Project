You can use @Embedded(prefix = &quot;a suitable prefix&quot;).\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a working example.\r\n\r\nThe **Parent** class/entity :-\r\n\r\n    @Entity\r\n    class Parent {\r\n        public static final String PREFIX = &quot;parent_&quot;;\r\n        @PrimaryKey\r\n        Long id=null;\r\n        String name;\r\n    \r\n        Parent(){}\r\n        @Ignore\r\n        Parent(String name) {\r\n            this.name = name;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe **Child** class/entity :-\r\n\r\n    @Entity\r\n    class Child {\r\n        public static final String PREFIX = &quot;child_&quot;;\r\n        @PrimaryKey\r\n        Long id = null;\r\n        long parent;\r\n        String name;\r\n    \r\n        Child(){}\r\n        @Ignore\r\n        Child(long parent,String name) {\r\n            this.parent = parent;\r\n            this.name = name;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe POJO for the cartesian product of joining parent with child :-\r\n\r\n    class ParentChildCartesian {\r\n        @Embedded(prefix = Parent.PREFIX)\r\n        Parent parent;\r\n        @Embedded(prefix = Child.PREFIX)\r\n        Child child;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe Dao&#39;s (in an abstract class rather than interface, so abstract .... for dao methods):-\r\n\r\n    @Dao\r\n    abstract class AllDao {\r\n    \r\n        @Insert(onConflict = OnConflictStrategy.IGNORE)\r\n        abstract long insert(Parent parent);\r\n        @Insert(onConflict = OnConflictStrategy.IGNORE)\r\n        abstract long insert(Child child);\r\n    \r\n        @Query(&quot;SELECT parent.id AS &quot; + Parent.PREFIX + &quot;id, &quot; +\r\n                &quot;parent.name AS &quot; + Parent.PREFIX + &quot;name, &quot; +\r\n                &quot;child.id AS &quot; + Child.PREFIX + &quot;id,&quot; +\r\n                &quot;child.parent AS &quot; + Child.PREFIX + &quot;parent,&quot; +\r\n                &quot;child.name AS &quot; + Child.PREFIX + &quot;name &quot; +\r\n                &quot; FROM parent JOIN child ON child.parent = parent.id&quot;\r\n        )\r\n        abstract List&lt;ParentChildCartesian&gt; getParentChildCartesianList();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nObviously a suitable @Database class, in this it is TheDatabase (no need to show).\r\n\r\nFinally, demonstrating the above being used:-\r\n\r\n        db = TheDatabase.getInstance(this);\r\n        dao = db.getAllDao();\r\n\r\n        long p1 = dao.insert(new Parent(&quot;Parent1&quot;));\r\n        long p2 = dao.insert(new Parent(&quot;Parent2&quot;));\r\n        dao.insert(new Child(p1,&quot;Child1&quot;));\r\n        dao.insert(new Child(p1,&quot;Child2&quot;));\r\n        dao.insert(new Child(p1,&quot;Child3&quot;));\r\n        dao.insert(new Child(p2,&quot;Child4&quot;));\r\n\r\n        for(ParentChildCartesian pc: dao.getParentChildCartesianList()) {\r\n            Log.d(\r\n                    &quot;DBINFO&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;Parent name is &quot; + pc.parent.name + &quot; id is&quot; + pc.parent.id +\r\n                            &quot;. Child name is &quot; + pc.child.name + &quot; id is &quot; + pc.child.id + &quot; parent id is &quot; + pc.child.parent);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThe result in the log :-\r\n\r\n    D/DBINFO: Parent name is Parent1 id is1. Child name is Child1 id is 1 parent id is 1\r\n    D/DBINFO: Parent name is Parent1 id is1. Child name is Child2 id is 2 parent id is 1\r\n    D/DBINFO: Parent name is Parent1 id is1. Child name is Child3 id is 3 parent id is 1\r\n    D/DBINFO: Parent name is Parent2 id is2. Child name is Child4 id is 4 parent id is 2\r\n\r\nHowever, I think you want all the children&#39;s name with with parent in a single row. This can utilise the PJO above but a different query that GROUP&#39;s the data allow the use of the group_concat aggregate function e.g. :-\r\n\r\n    @Query(&quot;SELECT parent.id AS &quot; + Parent.PREFIX + &quot;id, &quot; +\r\n            &quot;parent.name AS &quot; + Parent.PREFIX + &quot;name, &quot; +\r\n            &quot;child.id AS &quot; + Child.PREFIX + &quot;id,&quot; + /* note will be an arbitrary id */\r\n            &quot;child.parent AS &quot; + Child.PREFIX + &quot;parent,&quot; +\r\n            &quot;group_concat(child.name) AS &quot; + Child.PREFIX + &quot;name &quot; +\r\n            &quot;FROM parent &quot; +\r\n            &quot;JOIN child ON child.parent = parent.id &quot; +\r\n            &quot;GROUP BY parent.id&quot;\r\n    )\r\n    abstract List&lt;ParentChildCartesian&gt; getParentwithCSV();\r\n\r\nWhen used with :-\r\n\r\n        for (ParentChildCartesian pc: dao.getParentwithCSV()) {\r\n            Log.d(\r\n                    &quot;DBINFO&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;Parent is &quot; + pc.parent.name+ &quot; children are &quot; + pc.child.name\r\n            );\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThe Log includes :-\r\n\r\n    D/DBINFO: Parent is Parent1 children are Child1,Child2,Child3\r\n    D/DBINFO: Parent is Parent2 children are Child4\r\n\r\nYou don&#39;t need to use @Embedded, this conveniently includes the member variables of the object.\r\n\r\nSo consider the POJO :-\r\n\r\n    class WithoutEmbedded {\r\n        long parentId;\r\n        String parentName;\r\n        String childrenNameCSV;\r\n        String childrenIdCSV;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou have to match the member variable names with column names so you could have, for example :-\r\n\r\n    @Query(&quot;SELECT parent.id AS parentId, &quot; +\r\n            &quot;parent.name AS parentName, &quot; +\r\n            &quot;group_concat(child.name) AS childrenNameCSV, &quot; +\r\n            &quot;group_concat(child.id) AS childrenIdCSV &quot; +\r\n            &quot;FROM parent &quot; +\r\n            &quot;JOIN child ON child.parent = parent.id &quot; +\r\n            &quot;GROUP BY parent.id&quot;\r\n    )\r\n    abstract List&lt;WithoutEmbedded&gt; getParentsWithchildrenCSVandChildrenIdCSV();\r\n\r\nUsing :-\r\n \r\n        for(WithoutEmbedded pc: dao.getParentsWithchildrenCSVandChildrenIdCSV()) {\r\n            Log.d(\r\n                    &quot;DBINFO&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;Parent is &quot; + pc.parentName + &quot; children are &quot; + pc.childrenNameCSV + &quot; children ids are &quot; + pc.childrenIdCSV\r\n            );\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThe result in the log would be :-\r\n\r\n    D/DBINFO: Parent is Parent1 children are Child1,Child2,Child3 children ids are 1,2,3\r\n    D/DBINFO: Parent is Parent2 children are Child4 children ids are 4\r\n\r\nIn short @Relation does the equivalent of a join by using an underlying queries for ALL related children and hence the recommendation for @Transaction.\r\n\r\nWhilst @Embedded expects the result of the query to have columns that match the member variable names of the embedded classes and therefore JOINS can be used (including filtering). As it&#39;s all done in a single query there is no need for an @Transaction.\r\n\r\n@Embedded is basically a convenience so can be omitted by including member variables manually. (again no need for @Transaction).\r\n\r\n\r\n **Additional**\r\n\r\nRe comments. It is now a little clearer what you want. In short your original issue was the clue. You can use @Embedded and @Realtion for what you want (if I understand correctly).\r\n\r\ne.g. from a working example :-\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nMary and Fred are parents (rows repeated due to a few test runs).\r\n\r\nThe adapter should be along the lines of :-\r\n\r\n    class MyAdapter extends ArrayAdapter&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt; ....\r\n\r\nwhere ParentWithChildren is the @Embedded .... @Realation POJO e.g. :-\r\n\r\n    class ParentWithChildren {\r\n        @Embedded\r\n        Parent parent;\r\n        @Relation(\r\n                entity = Child.class,\r\n                parentColumn = Parent.COL_PARENT_ID,\r\n                entityColumn = Child.COL_PARENT_MAP\r\n        )\r\n        List&lt;Child&gt;

object in the ListView, retrieving the parent attributes and showing them in every element. Due to I am trying to follow [Android&#39;s Model-View-ViewModel architecture patterns][1], I am using RoomDb, a Repository class and a ViewModel class (viewmodel class holds logic for both parent and children; I wonder if this is an antipattern or not; but that might be a subject for another question).\r\n\r\nAnyway, due to I have to make the queries retrieving LiveData objects that hold lists of POJOs, this limits the data I can show on the ListView to only parent&#39;s fields, because of the POJO only contains parent table&#39;s fields; and making a query for every single parentID to retrieve all the child objects in some kind of loop doesn&#39;t sound good for some reason. So, while searching about this on the internet, I found (but I don&#39;t remember where) this way of making some kind of &quot;Relational Entity&quot; that holds both parent and children:\r\n\r\n    import androidx.room.Embedded;\r\n    import androidx.room.Relation;\r\n\r\n    import java.io.Serializable;\r\n    import java.util.List;\r\n\r\n    public class ParentWithChildren implements Serializable {\r\n        @Embedded public Parent parent;\r\n        @Relation(\r\n                parentColumn = &quot;id&quot;,\r\n                entityColumn = &quot;parent_id&quot;\r\n        )\r\n        public List&lt;Child&gt; children;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen, from my ParentDao, I added this:\r\n\r\n    // XXX The old DAO searcher that already works for retrieving\r\n    //     just the parent POJOs\r\n    @Query(&quot;SELECT * FROM parent WHERE parent_field1 = :search OR parent_field2 = :search_no_accents&quot;)\r\n    LiveData&lt;List&lt;Parent&gt;&gt; searchParents(String search, String search_no_accents);\r\n\r\n    // XXX The new method I&#39;d like to create\r\n    @Transaction\r\n    @Query(&quot;SELECT * FROM parent WHERE parent_field1 = :search OR parent_field2 = :search_no_accents&quot;)\r\n    LiveData&lt;List&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt;&gt; searchParentsWithChildren(String search, String search_no_accents);\r\n\r\nAnd, in my Repository class:\r\n\r\n    public LiveData&lt;List&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt;&gt; searchParentsWithChildren(String search, String search_no_accents) {\r\n        return parent_dao.searchParentsWithChildren(search, search_no_accents);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n...and here is my ParentViewModel&#39;s method to retrieve the list from the Repository:\r\n\r\n    public LiveData&lt;List&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt;&gt; searchParentsWithChildren(String search) {\r\n        // I remove accents from user search with and ad-hoc method\r\n        String search_no_accents = removeAccents(search);\r\n        return repository.searchParentsWithChildren(search, search_no_accents);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn my MainActivity, I have a SearchView that handles the user&#39;s search:\r\n\r\n    SearchView search_view = findViewById(R.id.searchView);\r\n    search_view.setOnQueryTextListener(new SearchView.OnQueryTextListener() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public boolean onQueryTextSubmit(String query) {\r\n            if (query.equals(&quot;&quot;)) {\r\n                loadFullListFragment();\r\n            } else {\r\n                search_results = parent_viewmodel.searchParents(query);\r\n                //search_with_children = parent_viewmodel.searchParentsWithChildren(query);\r\n\r\n                observeSearchResults(search_results);\r\n                //observeSearchResults(search_with_children);\r\n            }\r\n            return true;\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\nMy `observeSearchResults` method, also in MainActivity, loads the appropiate fragment depending on the size of the result&#39;s list:\r\n\r\n    private void observeSearchResults(LiveData&lt;List&lt;Parent&gt;&gt; parents_results) {\r\n    //private void observeSearchResults(LiveData&lt;List&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt;&gt; parents_with_children) {\r\n        parents_results.observe(this, new Observer&lt;List&lt;Parent&gt;&gt;() {\r\n        //parents_with_children.observe(this, new Observer&lt;List&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt;&gt;() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            //public void onChanged(List&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt;

0 ) {\r\n                    // TODO XXX This is kinda hacky\r\n                    loadParentProfileFragment(parents.get(0));\r\n                } else {\r\n                    transaction = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();\r\n                    transaction.replace(R.id.fragmentContainer, insertFragment);\r\n                    transaction.addToBackStack(null);\r\n                    transaction.commit();\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Well, you see those commented-out lines of code?** It&#39;s the new changes I want to introduce to start using the new ParentWithChildren entity. **They are commented-out because the ones directly above or below them are the ones that are already working to show parent&#39;s objects in ListView.** So, when I try to implement the changes, I comment-out the old ones and &quot;dis-comment-out&quot; the ones with `ParentWithChildren` changes. I have to change so many classes to implement **one single change**... Hmmm... it smells like [Shotgun Surgery][2] here... :-(\r\n\r\n...well, long story short, I try to replace in the Fragment that loads the ListView the previous `List&lt;Parent&gt;` with `List&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt;`, so every list element will be able to retrieve also the parent related child objects and show them. But, the last time I tried to implement `ParentWithChildren` entity this way, it crashed with this Exception (which absolutely blows my mind):\r\n\r\n&gt; java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Failed resolution of: com/mydomain/myapp/daos/ParentDao_Impl$5;\r\n\r\nThe Traceback of this exception started at some line in this auto-generated `ParentDao_Implement`, and the next line of the Traceback pointed at my new `Repository.searchParentsWithChildren` method. **I absolutely don&#39;t know if either I am doing it wrong, or how to deal with this strange failure.**\r\n\r\n## My ArrayAdapter and what I&#39;d like it to become\r\nThis snippet shows my currently working ArrayAdapter, and commented-out lines of code that show more or less what changes I want to introduce:\r\n\r\n    public class ParentsArrayAdapter extends ArrayAdapter&lt;Parent&gt; {\r\n    //public class ParentsArrayAdapter extends ArrayAdapter&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt; {\r\n\r\n        //public ParentsArrayAdapter(Context context, List&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt; parents) {\r\n        public ParentsArrayAdapter(Context context, List&lt;Parent&gt; parents) {\r\n            super(context, 0, parents);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup vgroup) {\r\n            // Get the data item for this position\r\n            Parent parent = getItem(position);\r\n            //ParentWithChildren parent = getItem(position);\r\n            // XXX TODO Load child attributes list\r\n\r\n            // Check if an existing view is being reused, otherwise inflate the view\r\n            if (convertView == null) {\r\n                convertView = LayoutInflater.from(getContext())\r\n                       .inflate(R.layout.listview_parents, vgroup, false);\r\n            }\r\n            // Lookup view for data population\r\n            TextView parentField1 = convertView.findViewById(R.id.list_parentField1);\r\n            // Populate the data into the template view using the data object\r\n            parentField1.setText(parent.getField1());\r\n            //parentField1.setText(parent.parent.getField1());\r\n\r\n            TextView parentField2 = convertView.findViewById(R.id.list_parentField2);\r\n            parentField2.setText(parent.getField2());\r\n            //pinyinText.setText(parent.parent.getField2());\r\n\r\n            // TODO Load first 5-10 childs here (when ParentWithChildren works)\r\n            TextView childrenCommaListField = convertView.findViewById(R.id.list_childsCommaList);\r\n            /*\r\n                 &#191;&#191;??

So, while searching about this on the internet, I found (but I don't remember where) this way of making some kind of &quot;Relational Entity&quot; that holds both parent and children:</p>\n<pre><code>import androidx.room.Embedded;\nimport androidx.room.Relation;\n\nimport java.io.Serializable;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class ParentWithChildren implements Serializable {\n    @Embedded public Parent parent;\n    @Relation(\n            parentColumn = &quot;id&quot;,\n            entityColumn = &quot;parent_id&quot;\n    )\n    public List&lt;Child&gt; children;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, from my ParentDao, I added this:</p>\n<pre><code>// XXX The old DAO searcher that already works for retrieving\n//     just the parent POJOs\n@Query(&quot;SELECT * FROM parent WHERE parent_field1 = :search OR parent_field2 = :search_no_accents&quot;)\nLiveData&lt;List&lt;Parent&gt;&gt; searchParents(String search, String search_no_accents);\n\n// XXX The new method I'd like to create\n@Transaction\n@Query(&quot;SELECT * FROM parent WHERE parent_field1 = :search OR parent_field2 = :search_no_accents&quot;)\nLiveData&lt;List&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt;&gt; searchParentsWithChildren(String search, String search_no_accents);\n</code></pre>\n<p>And, in my Repository class:</p>\n<pre><code>public LiveData&lt;List&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt;&gt; searchParentsWithChildren(String search, String search_no_accents) {\n    return parent_dao.searchParentsWithChildren(search, search_no_accents);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>...and here is my ParentViewModel's method to retrieve the list from the Repository:</p>\n<pre><code>public LiveData&lt;List&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt;&gt; searchParentsWithChildren(String search) {\n    // I remove accents from user search with and ad-hoc method\n    String search_no_accents = removeAccents(search);\n    return repository.searchParentsWithChildren(search, search_no_accents);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In my MainActivity, I have a SearchView that handles the user's search:</p>\n<pre><code>SearchView search_view = findViewById(R.id.searchView);\nsearch_view.setOnQueryTextListener(new SearchView.OnQueryTextListener() {\n    @Override\n    public boolean onQueryTextSubmit(String query) {\n        if (query.equals(&quot;&quot;)) {\n            loadFullListFragment();\n        } else {\n            search_results = parent_viewmodel.searchParents(query);\n            //search_with_children = parent_viewmodel.searchParentsWithChildren(query);\n\n            observeSearchResults(search_results);\n            //observeSearchResults(search_with_children);\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>My <code>observeSearchResults</code> method, also in MainActivity, loads the appropiate fragment depending on the size of the result's list:</p>\n<pre><code>private void observeSearchResults(LiveData&lt;List&lt;Parent&gt;&gt; parents_results) {\n//private void observeSearchResults(LiveData&lt;List&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt;&gt; parents_with_children) {\n    parents_results.observe(this, new Observer&lt;List&lt;Parent&gt;&gt;() {\n    //parents_with_children.observe(this, new Observer&lt;List&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt;&gt;() {\n        @Override\n        //public void onChanged(List&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt; parents) {\n        public void onChanged(List&lt;Parent&gt; parents) {\n            if ( parents.size() &gt; 1 ) {\n                // ## List view of multiple results\n                listFragment = ParentsListFragment.newInstance( (ArrayList)parents );\n                transaction = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();\n                transaction.replace(R.id.fragmentContainer, listFragment);\n                transaction.addToBackStack(null);\n                transaction.commit();\n            }\n            else if ( parents.size() &gt; 0 ) {\n                // TODO XXX This is kinda hacky\n                loadParentProfileFragment(parents.get(0));\n            } else {\n                transaction = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();\n                transaction.replace(R.id.fragmentContainer, insertFragment);\n                transaction.addToBackStack(null);\n                transaction.commit();\n            }\n        }\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Well, you see those commented-out lines of code?</strong> It's the new changes I want to introduce to start using the new ParentWithChildren entity. <strong>They are commented-out because the ones directly above or below them are the ones that are already working to show parent's objects in ListView.</strong> So, when I try to implement the changes, I comment-out the old ones and &quot;dis-comment-out&quot; the ones with <code>ParentWithChildren</code> changes. I have to change so many classes to implement <strong>one single change</strong>... Hmmm... it smells like <a href=\"https://refactoring.guru/es/smells/shotgun-surgery\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shotgun Surgery</a> here... :-(</p>\n<p>...well, long story short, I try to replace in the Fragment that loads the ListView the previous <code>List&lt;Parent&gt;</code> with <code>List&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt;</code>, so every list element will be able to retrieve also the parent related child objects and show them. But, the last time I tried to implement <code>ParentWithChildren</code> entity this way, it crashed with this Exception (which absolutely blows my mind):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Failed resolution of: com/mydomain/myapp/daos/ParentDao_Impl$5;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Traceback of this exception started at some line in this auto-generated <code>ParentDao_Implement</code>, and the next line of the Traceback pointed at my new <code>Repository.searchParentsWithChildren</code> method. <strong>I absolutely don't know if either I am doing it wrong, or how to deal with this strange failure.</strong></p>\n<h2>My ArrayAdapter and what I'd like it to become</h2>\n<p>This snippet shows my currently working ArrayAdapter, and commented-out lines of code that show more or less what changes I want to introduce:</p>\n<pre><code>public class ParentsArrayAdapter extends ArrayAdapter&lt;Parent&gt; {\n//public class ParentsArrayAdapter extends ArrayAdapter&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt; {\n\n    //public ParentsArrayAdapter(Context context, List&lt;ParentWithChildren&gt; parents) {\n    public ParentsArrayAdapter(Context context, List&lt;Parent&gt; parents) {\n        super(context, 0, parents);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup vgroup) {\n        // Get the data item for this position\n        Parent parent = getItem(position);\n        //ParentWithChildren parent = getItem(position);\n        // XXX TODO Load child attributes list\n\n        // Check if an existing view is being reused, otherwise inflate the view\n        if (convertView == null) {\n            convertView = LayoutInflater.from(getContext())\n                   .inflate(R.layout.listview_parents, vgroup, false);\n        }\n        // Lookup view for data population\n        TextView parentField1 = convertView.findViewById(R.id.list_parentField1);\n        // Populate the data into the template view using the data object\n        parentField1.setText(parent.getField1());\n        //parentField1.setText(parent.parent.getField1());\n\n        TextView parentField2 = convertView.findViewById(R.id.list_parentField2);\n        parentField2.setText(parent.getField2());\n        //pinyinText.setText(parent.parent.getField2());\n\n        // TODO Load first 5-10 childs here (when ParentWithChildren works)\n        TextView childrenCommaListField = convertView.findViewById(R.id.list_childsCommaList);\n        /*\n             ¿¿??

If it&#39;s degrees, it could be 0 to 359.\r\n\r\nPut the `sdl.write` method in its own thread, inside a `while` loop and keep it running continuously.\r\n\r\nMake a class or function that provides the &quot;next&quot; block of sine data on demand. If you need an array size for the write, something like 4K might be a good starting guess. In my experience, anything from 1k to 8k works fine. The while loop holding the sdl calls this function once per each write operation.\r\n\r\nNow, your `angle` value in your data on-demand function needs to be determined by adding two parts: (1) the part that cycles on pitch continously (similar to what you are already doing), (2) a &quot;phase&quot; variable that holds an angle value that can range from 0 to one full period.\r\n\r\nHave the slider tied to the &quot;phase&quot; variable. Probably some form of loose coupling would be good, to prevent the changes to the &quot;phase&quot; variable from blocking the sine-wave calculation.\r\n\r\nA couple of cautions, though. For one, as you move the slider, you will likely create some clicks unless you build in a function to spread out the changes in the &quot;phase&quot; value over, say, 128 PCM values. Secondly, the volumes have to match for true cancellation, so a volume slider as well as the phase slider might be needed. The &quot;volume&quot; slider can range from 0 to 1, creating a factor that you multiply against the PCM values that you are holding in the `short` array.\r\n\r\nThe main thing, since there is a single starting point for this continuous signal, (thanks to running the sdl continuously in the while loop), there should be *some* point on the slide that best corresponds to the cancellation. It will be a different point on the slider each time, of course.","title":"How can I make cancellation sound by using single frequency sound?","body":"<p>I'm just looking at the <code>MakeSound</code> class.

Unfortunately, you can not reverse a linked list with cycles.

This is a pretty common pattern.</p>\n<p>In your case, I would &quot;suggest&quot; that you add a <code>DocumentListener</code> to the <code>JTextField</code>'s <code>Document</code> and when it's

A Dockerfile can have both an `ENTRYPOINT` and a `CMD`; if you do, [the `CMD` gets passed as arguments to the `ENTRYPOINT`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#understand-how-cmd-and-entrypoint-interact).  This means you can make the `ENTRYPOINT` a shell script that does first-time setup, then ends with `exec &quot;$@&quot;` to replace itself with the `CMD`.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\n# docker-entrypoint.sh\r\n\r\n# copy the configuration to the right place\r\ncp configs var/opt/configs/\r\n\r\n# run the main container command\r\nexec &quot;$@&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the Dockerfile, make sure to `COPY` the script in (it should be checked in to source control as executable) and set it as the `ENTRYPOINT`.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n...\r\nCOPY docker-entrypoint.sh .\r\nENTRYPOINT [&quot;./docker-entrypoint.sh&quot;] # must be JSON-array syntax\r\nCMD [&quot;java&quot;, &quot;-jar&quot;, &quot;/app.jar&quot;]      # what was previously ENTRYPOINT\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you run the container it&#39;s straightforward to replace the `CMD`, so you can double-check that this is doing the right thing by running an interactive shell in place of the `java` application.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ndocker run -v &quot;$PWD/alt-configs:/configs&quot; --rm -it my-image sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you do need to override the command like this at `docker run` time, the command you show uses `&amp;&amp;` to run two commands consecutively.  This needs to run a shell to be understood correctly, and in this context you need to manually provide a `/bin/sh -c` wrapper.\r\n\r\nI would still recommend changing `ENTRYPOINT` to `CMD` in your Dockerfile; then you could run a relatively straightforward\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ndocker run \\\r\n  ... \\\r\n  -v &quot;$PWD/alt-configs:/configs&quot; \\\r\n  my-image \\\r\n  /bin/sh -c &#39;cp configs var/opt/configs &amp;&amp; java -jar /app.jar&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you use `--entrypoint`, it only takes the first word out of this command, and it is a Docker options so it needs to come _before_ the image name.

How can I make the callback function be called <strong>on the main thread</strong> and <strong>not</strong> the new thread?</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> This is the code that I have tried:</p>\n<pre><code>import java.util.Random;\n\npublic class ATestThreadClass {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        new Thread(new RandomRunnable(data -&gt; {\n        System.out.println(&quot;Called on &quot; + Thread.currentThread().getName());\n        System.out.println(data.toString());\n    })).start();\n}\n\n    static class RandomRunnable implements Runnable {\n    private final CallbackInterface callbackInterface;\n\n    public RandomRunnable(CallbackInterface callbackInterface) {\n        this.callbackInterface = callbackInterface;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        // Do some very long work...\n        Random random = new Random();\n        RandomCallbackData data = new RandomCallbackData();\n        data.a = random.nextInt(100);\n        data.b = random.getClass().getSimpleName();\n        data.c = random.nextLong();\n        callbackInterface.callback(data); // THIS REALLY NEEDS TO BE CALLED ON THE MAIN THREAD\n    }\n}\n\n\ninterface CallbackInterface {\n    void callback(RandomCallbackData data);\n}\n\nstatic class RandomCallbackData {\n    public int a;\n    public String b;\n    public long c;\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return &quot;RandomCallbackData{&quot; +\n                &quot;a=&quot; + a +\n                &quot;, b='&quot; + b + '\\'' +\n                &quot;, c=&quot; + c +\n                '}';\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>(Sorry for weird formatting; stack overflow messes it up when I paste in the code)</p>\n<p>And the following is the log:</p>\n<pre><code>Called on Thread-3\nRandomCallbackData{a=77, b='Random', c=-7871432476136355770}\n\nProcess finished with exit code 0\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","snmp","snmp-trap","jdmk"],"owner":{"account_id":58806,"reputation":3557,"user_id":176010,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"Dale"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1635281445,"creation_date":1635281445,"question_id":69729798,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m coding a java program, using the JDMK 5.1 toolkit, to send SNMPv3 traps and the jdmk security file (jdmk.security.file) I seem to need to create, and have in place, to do so currently has the authorization and privacy keys in the clear.\r\n\r\nHow can I cause those values, which I consider to be passwords, be secured and still be usable by the toolkit when it reads that data from the file?\r\n\r\nThe documentation says you may specify &quot;Any text password or any hexadecimal key starting with 0x&quot; for those values but does not elaborate.
