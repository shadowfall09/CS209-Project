I have to find a value at a specific index in the internal array for each object, and then output the array as well as keep track of matches. The search is partially working as it will find some values but not all of them.</p>\n<pre><code>//record is empty. I put it there so I wouldn't have to call it every time.\n\n    public String binarySearch( int index, int first,  int last, double key, int amount, DrillingRecord record) {\n        if (last &gt;= first) {\n            int mid = first + (last - first) / 2;\n            if (mid &lt; count) { //count is size of the array of objects, data[]\n                for (int j = 0; j &lt;= mid; j++) {\n                    record = (DrillingRecord) data[j];  //Object[] array hence the cast\n                    double[] dataRecord = record.getNums(); //getNums returns array of doubles\n                    if (dataRecord[index-2] == key) { //index-2 is not the problem\n                        amount++;                        \n                        System.out.println(record.noErrors()); // noErrors is basically toString\n                    }\n                }\n                record = (DrillingRecord) data[mid];\n                double[] dataRecord = record.getNums();\n                if (dataRecord[index-2] &lt; key ) {\n                    return binarySearch(index, first, mid+1, key, amount, record);\n                } else if (dataRecord[index-2] &gt; key) {\n                    return binarySearch(index, mid-1, last, key, amount, record);\n                }\n            }\n            }\n        if (amount == 0) {\n            return &quot;-1 /n Drilling records found: &quot; + amount;\n        }\n        return &quot;Drilling records found: &quot; + amount;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>For example, I know there are 4 records with a value of 12.0 at index 3, but when I run the program it says it only found 2. I've been troubleshooting this for a while, and I suspect it has something to do with the for loop I'm just not quite sure what that is.</p>\n<p>Thank you for any help it's much appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","user-interface","button"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2360785,"reputation":11123,"user_id":2067492,"display_name":"matt"},"score":1,"creation_date":1634331327,"post_id":69590481,"comment_id":123004649,"body_markdown":"You shouldn&#39;t be using setBounds, your layout manager is handling that.

Indeed, if I quit airplane mode date is properly set again.</p>\n<p>Maybe a situation like the previous could be detected with something like a service that checks that the user has restarted the phone, and then a service at phone startup that determines date is taken again properly, so then app checks that service says that it's properly taken and so it allows the user to take it... But all this seems hard to do and we may bug honest users that had to restart their phones in a zone with no telephony connectivity and then try to use the app without trying to trick other date.</p>\n<p>So, any idea on a not too complicated method and no bugging for honest users that could achieve getting the date with no connectivity of any class? Or is this impossible?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","class","arraylist","methods"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":22354823,"reputation":16499,"user_id":16572295,"display_name":"Jo&#227;o Dias"},"score":0,"creation_date":1634222996,"post_id":69572769,"comment_id":122972405,"body_markdown":"&quot;when I run it&quot;, how exactly do you do that?","body":"&quot;when I run it&quot;, how exactly do you do that?"},{"owner":{"account_id":8896897,"reputation":53,"user_id":6641648,"display_name":"pietnam"},"score":0,"creation_date":1634223011,"post_id":69572769,"comment_id":122972414,"body_markdown":"Could you post your `viewEmployees` implementation and also show us how you&#39;re calling it?","body":"Could you post your <code>viewEmployees</code> implementation and also show us how you&#39;re calling it?"},{"owner":{"account_id":1167515,"reputation":313,"user_id":1145459,"accept_rate":50,"display_name":"Bluddymarri"},"score":0,"creation_date":1634223997,"post_id":69572769,"comment_id":122972866,"body_markdown":"Maybe to get you closer to the problem, you could also try to print the content of `addEmpName` and `addEmpEmail`, so you know that the user input actually made it&#39;s way to your variables :) Beside that, without knowing how you execute it and what the implementation of viewEmployees is, it will be hard for us to spot the issue.\n\nAlso, you might want to make yourself comfortable with the concept of debugging the code.","body":"Maybe to get you closer to the problem, you could also try to print the content of <code>addEmpName</code> and <code>addEmpEmail</code>, so you know that the user input actually made it&#39;s way to your variables :) Beside that, without knowing how you execute it and what the implementation of viewEmployees is, it will be hard for us to spot the issue.
