That is what Excel does not tolerate and alerts the error about.\r\n\r\nYour program does the following:\r\nIt starts with `int b=i; int a=i;` where `i` points to the first row. The values in first row and second row are equal. So your program sets `a = b;` so that now both `a` and `b` point to the first row. Then it merges `spreadsheet.addMergedRegion(new CellRangeAddress(a+1, b, 1, 1));`. So it creates `&lt;mergeCell ref=&quot;B2:B1&quot;/&gt;`. This is not really correct as it should be `&lt;mergeCell ref=&quot;B1:B2&quot;/&gt;`. But that Excel would tolerate. Now `i` increases and points to second row. The values in second row and third row are not equal. So your program sets `b = i;`. Now `b` points to second row but `a` has not changed and points to first row. Now your code merges `a+1` and `b` which both points to second row. So it creates `&lt;mergeCell ref=&quot;B2:B2&quot;/&gt;`. That one-cell-merged-region is useless but would be tolerated by Excel.

The values in first row and second row are equal. So your program sets <code>a = b;</code> so that now both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> point to the first row. Then it merges <code>spreadsheet.addMergedRegion(new CellRangeAddress(a+1, b, 1, 1));</code>. So it creates <code>&lt;mergeCell ref=&quot;B2:B1&quot;/&gt;</code>. This is not really correct as it should be <code>&lt;mergeCell ref=&quot;B1:B2&quot;/&gt;</code>. But that Excel would tolerate. Now <code>i</code> increases and points to second row. The values in second row and third row are not equal. So your program sets <code>b = i;</code>. Now <code>b</code> points to second row but <code>a</code> has not changed and points to first row. Now your code merges <code>a+1</code> and <code>b</code> which both points to second row. So it creates <code>&lt;mergeCell ref=&quot;B2:B2&quot;/&gt;</code>.

You need to understand the significant limitations fundamental to the question &#39;We are compiling class X; can I get a list of all subtypes of this class?&#39;, because otherwise you&#39;re going to shoot yourself in the foot. Then I&#39;ll get to the workarounds.\r\n\r\nThe issue is, a superclass is fine. After all, this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Bob extends Alice {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nis not even going to compile if `Alice` is not available either as source file or as compiled class file when the compiler attempts to compile `Bob`. Therefore, asking the annotation processing (AP) tools to give you a `TypeMirror` object representing `Alice` is fine. It&#39;ll be there.\r\n\r\nHowever, given that somewhere else in the codebase, `class Carol extends Bob {}` exists, __is irrelevant__, and if neither that source file nor that class file is around, __`Bob.java` still compiles just fine__. That&#39;s __why__ the AP tools API doesn&#39;t give you a `.getSubtypes()` method. Because the docs would have to say something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * Finds all subtypes that are mirrorable in the current compilation context\r\n * &lt;b&gt;but this does not do what you think it does and will miss a ton of classes,\r\n * please read a page worth of caveats or prepare to shoot your foot off&lt;/b&gt;:\r\n * \r\n * &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;loooong list of caveats here&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n */\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas the same list of caveats aren&#39;t necessary for `getSupertypes()`, because the cases where supertypes cannot be found are rare, are going to stop compilation anyway, and can thus don&#39;t apply (APs don&#39;t run when compilation errors occur, or if they do, it&#39;s not likely to be important that they can&#39;t do the job right).\r\n\r\nYou have 2 crucial issues:\r\n\r\n## In any case, &#39;search the universe is impossible&#39;\r\n\r\nI can write a class that extends AbstractList. I can do it right now: `class ReiniersList extends AbstractList&lt;String&gt; {}`. That was easy. When Team OpenJDK compiles `AbstractList.java`, _of course_ `ReiniersList` cannot be returned when they run an AP that calls a hypothetical `.getSubtypes()`.\r\n\r\nSo, you need to figure out what _kind_ of subtype do you want. &quot;Anywhere in this package?&quot; &quot;Anywhere in the source and classpath?&quot; That last one is __impossible__ - the classpath abstract simply does not support a &#39;list&#39; directive. And yet that&#39;s probably what you intended to do here. The best option, in the sense that it really is the only thing that the AP API can meaningfully give you, is &#39;please give me all subclasses of this class __that are part of the current compilation run, and only in source file form__&#39;. In other words, if you run `javac *.java` in a package and this hits `AbstractFoo.java`, `FooImpl1.java`, and `FooImpl2.java`, then asking &#39;getSubtypes()` of the TypeMirror representing `AbstractFoo`, you would be able to get `FooImpl1` and `FooImpl2` typemirrors. That&#39;s possible.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, programming teams split projects, and other code that doesn&#39;t even exist yet could extend `AbstractFoo` 5 years from now and you can&#39;t get those in the list. You&#39;re going to have to make crystal clear what you actually &#39;mean&#39; when you ask for subtypes, and then check if that definition is something that the AP tools can even provide for you.\r\n\r\n## Inners\r\n\r\nmethod-local classes can extend a type but aren&#39;t part of the type mirror infrastructure. They cannot have an impact on type resolution. This is a rarely used java feature, perhaps you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about. It&#39;s this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Example {\r\n  void foo() {\r\n    class MethodLocalClass extends AbstractList&lt;String&gt; {}\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nis legal java, actually. Yes, I stuck a class def in the middle of a method declaration. Outside of the method decl this class is utterly invisible. You can&#39;t write `Example.MethodLocalClass` anywhere, except __inside__ `foo()`. Because of this, this class __does not exist__ at annotation processing time, effectively. You can&#39;t ask for it. It has no accessible fully qualified name. Nevertheless, it could be a subclass. Point is, `getSubtypes()` cannot return it, ever. If that is a problem, then you can&#39;t do this at all. Hopefully, you&#39;re okay with this.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Incremental compilation\r\n\r\nThat problem of &#39;search the universe is impossible&#39; takes on an acute role in making what you want completely impossible, at least as far as the AP tools are concerned, when you factor in that most compilation is done incrementally: __Only__ the source files that need recompilation (because they were modified) are recompiled. That means if you have `AbstractFoo`, `FooImpl1` and `FooImpl2` all in the same package, and you edit AbstractFoo and FooImpl1, but don&#39;t touch FooImpl2, and then save and recompile, your compiler infra (be it an IDE, or maven, or gradle, or some other build tool) is rather likely to compile __only `AbstractFoo` and `FooImpl2`__ which means it is __not possible__ for the infra to give you FooImpl1.\r\n\r\nEven though `FooImpl1` is in the same project (in the same package, even!). And there is no way to ask: It&#39;s simply not in the &#39;source set&#39; of the compiler, and the classpath does not support a &#39;list&#39; directive (where `FooImpl2.class` lives - after all, that&#39;s _why_ it&#39;s not part of the source set, it already exists and does not need to be recreated).\r\n\r\n## Solutions\r\n\r\nThe main solution is to do a lot of bookkeeping yourself:\r\n\r\n1. First, understand that you cannot _ever_ get a list of stuff that lives outside your project. Only files that, on a complete clean recompilation run, would be touched, can be found. If it&#39;s in a different project built by the same team, you can find it, but stuff others write, or stuff that will be written in the future, you can __never__ find that. Ensure you don&#39;t need these, or we&#39;re done.\r\n\r\n2. Bookkeep every class you touch. Make a text file and write this (using the Filer, you can write non-java files too) into the output directory, listing all types you &#39;touched&#39;. Then, on init, read this file, and for each class in it, ask the type tools for this type. This &#39;solves&#39; the &quot;classpaths cannot list&quot; problem: Now you&#39;re not &#39;list all types and find me every type that extends X&#39;, now you are simply asking: &quot;Please give me a TypeMirror representing class X, get it from the source path or the class path, and tell me what types that type extends&quot;. Crucially, that second thing is something the AP infra __can__ do. You then do a quick &#39;cache clear&#39; - whatever classes do not exist anywhere, you now know - I guess someone deleted that file. For everything that does exist, then that is one of the subtypes, though they might not be part of this compilation &#39;source set&#39;.\r\n\r\nYou read the file during init, then you go through the rounds, extending this `Set&lt;String&gt;` (representing fully qualified types that are subtypes, automatically getting rid of duplicate names), and then on the last round (when `roundEnv.isLastRound()` is true), you check each type if it still exists and is a subtype of what you intended to be. And __now__ you have your list of subtypes. Write this pruned list back for future runs, and do whatever you want to do with &#39;you now have a list of type names that extend the type you are interested in&#39;.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not aware of any libraries that can help you with this. It&#39;s not too hard to write it yourself.\r\n\r\nThis principle of &#39;write a file that contains, per line, the fully qualified type of some relevant type&#39; smacks a lot of the SPI system, but crucially this one runs during compilation whereas SPI is designed as a runtime discovery system.\r\n","title":"Annotation Processing get element subclass/subtypes","body":"<p>You can't.

The best option, in the sense that it really is the only thing that the AP API can meaningfully give you, is 'please give me all subclasses of this class <strong>that are part of the current compilation run, and only in source file form</strong>'. In other words, if you run <code>javac *.java</code> in a package and this hits <code>AbstractFoo.java</code>, <code>FooImpl1.java</code>, and <code>FooImpl2.java</code>, then asking 'getSubtypes()<code>of the TypeMirror representing</code>AbstractFoo<code>, you would be able to get </code>FooImpl1<code>and</code>FooImpl2` typemirrors. That's possible.</p>\n<p>The problem is, programming teams split projects, and other code that doesn't even exist yet could extend <code>AbstractFoo</code> 5 years from now and you can't get those in the list. You're going to have to make crystal clear what you actually 'mean' when you ask for subtypes, and then check if that definition is something that the AP tools can even provide for you.</p>\n<h2>Inners</h2>\n<p>method-local classes can extend a type but aren't part of the type mirror infrastructure. They cannot have an impact on type resolution. This is a rarely used java feature, perhaps you don't know what I'm talking about. It's this:</p>\n<pre><code>class Example {\n  void foo() {\n    class MethodLocalClass extends AbstractList&lt;String&gt; {}\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>is legal java, actually. Yes, I stuck a class def in the middle of a method declaration. Outside of the method decl this class is utterly invisible. You can't write <code>Example.MethodLocalClass</code> anywhere, except <strong>inside</strong> <code>foo()</code>. Because of this, this class <strong>does not exist</strong> at annotation processing time, effectively. You can't ask for it. It has no accessible fully qualified name. Nevertheless, it could be a subclass. Point is, <code>getSubtypes()</code> cannot return it, ever. If that is a problem, then you can't do this at all. Hopefully, you're okay with this.</p>\n<h2>Incremental compilation</h2>\n<p>That problem of 'search the universe is impossible' takes on an acute role in making what you want completely impossible, at least as far as the AP tools are concerned, when you factor in that most compilation is done incrementally: <strong>Only</strong> the source files that need recompilation (because they were modified) are recompiled. That means if you have <code>AbstractFoo</code>, <code>FooImpl1</code> and <code>FooImpl2</code> all in the same package, and you edit AbstractFoo and FooImpl1, but don't touch FooImpl2, and then save and recompile, your compiler infra (be it an IDE, or maven, or gradle, or some other build tool) is rather likely to compile <strong>only <code>AbstractFoo</code> and <code>FooImpl2</code></strong> which means it is <strong>not possible</strong> for the infra to give you FooImpl1.</p>\n<p>Even though <code>FooImpl1</code> is in the same project (in the same package, even!). And there is no way to ask: It's simply not in the 'source set' of the compiler, and the classpath does not support a 'list' directive (where <code>FooImpl2.class</code> lives - after all, that's <em>why</em> it's not part of the source set, it already exists and does not need to be recreated).</p>\n<h2>Solutions</h2>\n<p>The main solution is to do a lot of bookkeeping yourself:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>First, understand that you cannot <em>ever</em> get a list of stuff that lives outside your project. Only files that, on a complete clean recompilation run, would be touched, can be found. If it's in a different project built by the same team, you can find it, but stuff others write, or stuff that will be written in the future, you can <strong>never</strong> find that. Ensure you don't need these, or we're done.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Bookkeep every class you touch. Make a text file and write this (using the Filer, you can write non-java files too) into the output directory, listing all types you 'touched'. Then, on init, read this file, and for each class in it, ask the type tools for this type. This 'solves' the &quot;classpaths cannot list&quot; problem: Now you're not 'list all types and find me every type that extends X', now you are simply asking: &quot;Please give me a TypeMirror representing class X, get it from the source path or the class path, and tell me what types that type extends&quot;. Crucially, that second thing is something the AP infra <strong>can</strong> do. You then do a quick 'cache clear' - whatever classes do not exist anywhere, you now know - I guess someone deleted that file. For everything that does exist, then that is one of the subtypes, though they might not be part of this compilation 'source set'.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You read the file during init, then you go through the rounds, extending this <code>Set&lt;String&gt;</code> (representing fully qualified types that are subtypes, automatically getting rid of duplicate names), and then on the last round (when <code>roundEnv.isLastRound()</code> is true), you check each type if it still exists and is a subtype of what you intended to be. And <strong>now</strong> you have your list of subtypes. Write this pruned list back for future runs, and do whatever you want to do with 'you now have a list of type names that extend the type you are interested in'.</p>\n<p>I'm not aware of any libraries that can help you with this. It's not too hard to write it yourself.</p>\n<p>This principle of 'write a file that contains, per line, the fully qualified type of some relevant type' smacks a lot of the SPI system, but crucially this one runs during compilation whereas SPI is designed as a runtime discovery system.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":24287116,"reputation":408,"user_id":18232723,"display_name":"kylie.zoltan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":144,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":75269593,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1674927514,"creation_date":1674925159,"question_id":75269315,"body_markdown":"While processing an annotation, I want to get all the subclass/subtypes of an element.\r\n\r\nThe element will be a `Movie` so I would like to get Elements or TypeMirrors of `TerrorMovie ` and `ComedyMovie`.\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface Movie {}\r\n\r\nclass TerrorMovie implements Movie {}\r\n\r\nclass ComedyMovie implements Movie {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGetting the superType is easy as I can use the `Types.directSupertypes()` but how can I get the subtypes?\r\n\r\nThanks","title":"Annotation Processing get element subclass/subtypes","body":"<p>While processing an annotation, I want to get all the subclass/subtypes of an element.</p>\n<p>The element will be a <code>Movie</code> so I would like to get Elements or TypeMirrors of <code>TerrorMovie </code> and <code>ComedyMovie</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>interface Movie {}\n\nclass TerrorMovie implements Movie {}\n\nclass ComedyMovie implements Movie {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Getting the superType is easy as I can use the <code>Types.directSupertypes()</code> but how can I get the subtypes?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","deployment","web-deployment"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":11627789,"reputation":379,"user_id":8517040,"display_name":"Andres Rincon"},"score":0,"creation_date":1675374703,"post_id":75269587,"comment_id":132921467,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m having an issue when reading files from resource folders, I&#39;m reading the files with ClassPathResource but it fails","body":"I&#39;m having an issue when reading files from resource folders, I&#39;m reading the files with ClassPathResource but it fails"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":6350057,"reputation":157,"user_id":4929408,"display_name":"Mirza Suljić"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1674927469,"creation_date":1674927469,"answer_id":75269587,"question_id":75013825,"body_markdown":"I was having the same issue.

Your two suggested alternatives are good questions and I think allow us to see why the current approach is used.\r\n\r\n1. Can not the handler run on the top of the stack?\r\n\r\nIt could, of course. The main drawback to that would be that the stack would grow by a lot each time that an exception is handled.\r\n\r\nTake the following example code:\r\n\r\n    public Foo computeFoo() {\r\n      try {\r\n        // 1\r\n        return firstVersion();\r\n      } catch (Exception e) {\r\n        // 2\r\n        return secondVersion();\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSay that we arrived at point &quot;1&quot; via some method calls `a`, `b`, `c`. The stack of stack frames might then look like:\r\n\r\n    [ a, b, c, computeFoo ]\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say that `firstVersion` invokes methods x, y, z, and an exception is thrown inside &quot;z&quot;. At the moment the exception is thrown, the stack might look like:\r\n\r\n    [ a, b, c, computeFoo, firstVersion, x, y, z ]\r\n\r\nWhen we move to point 2, a traditional JVM would be able to discard all the data from x, y, z instantly and simply by truncating the stack before moving into `secondVersion`\r\n\r\n    [ a, b, c, computeFoo, secondVersion ]\r\n\r\nUnder your proposal, the JVM would need to retain the stack frame data from x, y and z on the stack, in case any code near &quot;2&quot; wanted to access the parameters:\r\n\r\n    [ a, b, c, computeFoo, firstVersion, x, y, z, secondVersion ]\r\n\r\nIt should be clear that, in general, this may result in a lot more data being stored on the stack in programs that use exceptions than needs to be at present. There would also be some extra book-keeping needed in the JVM to handle the &quot;mixed&quot; stack of in-use and preserved stack frames, which will complicate maintenance and slow things down.\r\n\r\nGiven that a) all parameter data is not usually needed by exceptions and b) there are easy workarounds for capturing specific parameter data when it is needed, the current standard tradeoff here seems better.\r\n\r\n2. Can not the handler run in a second stack with viewing rights to the first? \r\n\r\nIt could, of course, but that would be a great deal more work for the JVM to implement, which would slow everything down for a benefit that is not particularly compelling. Hence the current tradeoff.\r\n\r\nIt is always worth bearing in mind that these systems are not &quot;handed down from the gods&quot;, but have been designed by people and are the result of years of evolution, consensus-building and tradeoff. One of the most important reasons that the JVM works like this is because C++ used to work like this and that is what most people involved expect and understand.","title":"Get arguments from a scala exception","body":"<p>You cannot, at least not in normal program execution.</p>\n\n<p>When an exception is thrown, the stack is \"unwound\" and execution resumes at the nearest applicable \"catch\" block.

inputDoc);\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(result);\r\n\r\nThat `XdmItem` is an `XdmArray` (of a `XdmMap`s), so to convert that into a Java `List&lt;Map&lt;String,String&gt;&gt;` we can use the stream API:\r\n\r\n        List&lt;Map&lt;String,String&gt;&gt; javaMapList =\r\n                ((XdmArray)result).asList().stream()\r\n                        .map(\r\n                             m

).collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(javaMapList);\r\n\r\nor a bit more compact:\r\n\r\n        List&lt;Map&lt;String,String&gt;&gt; javaMapList =\r\n                ((XdmArray)result).asList().stream()\r\n                        .map(\r\n                             m -&gt; m.itemAt(0).asMap().entrySet()\r\n                             .stream()\r\n

serialize as JSON from Java, add\r\n\r\n        StringWriter sw = new StringWriter();\r\n        Serializer serializer = processor.newSerializer(sw);\r\n        serializer.setOutputProperty(Serializer.Property.METHOD, &quot;json&quot;);\r\n\r\n        processor.writeXdmValue(result, serializer);\r\n\r\n        String resultString = sw.toString();\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(resultString);\r\n\r\nIt might even be possible to get a single string result using the JAXP API and XPath 3.1 (or of course using s9api) by calling the `serialize` XPath function evaluating e.g.\r\n\r\n    serialize(array {\r\n        for $node in outermost(//Node_1/Node_1_1)\r\n        return \r\n          let $leaves := $node//*[not(*)]\r\n        return\r\n          $node!map:merge(\r\n            $leaves!map:entry(string-join((ancestor-or-self::* except $node/ancestor-or-self::*)/local-name(), &#39;.&#39;), string())\r\n          )\r\n    }, map { &#39;method&#39;:&#39;json&#39;})\r\n\r\nJava code:\r\n\r\n        XPathFactory saxonXPathFactory = new net.sf.saxon.xpath.XPathFactoryImpl();\r\n\r\n        String xpath31Expresssion = &quot;serialize(array {\\n&quot; +\r\n                &quot;    for $node in outermost(//Node_1/Node_1_1)\\n&quot; +\r\n                &quot;    return \\n&quot; +\r\n                &quot;      let

Thus your result.&lt;br /&gt;( 1_674_512_251L - 1_674_501_451L ) = 3 hours.\r\n - &#128073; You are making inappropriate use of [`LocalDateTime`][1] class.\r\n\r\n# Moment versus not-a-moment \r\n\r\n&gt;I am trying to use LocalDateTime to manipulate dates\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t.\r\n\r\nIf you are representing a moment, a specific point on the timeline, &#128073; do *not* use `LocalDateTime`. That class holds a date with a time-of-day but lacks the context of a time zone or offset-from-UTC. To represent a moment use:\r\n\r\n - [`Instant`][2] — A moment as seen in UTC (an offset from UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds).\r\n - [`OffsetDateTime`][3] - A moment as seen with a particular offset.\r\n - [`ZonedDateTime`][4] - A moment as seen through a particular time zone.\r\n\r\nI cannot imagine any scenario where calling `LocalDateTime.now` is the right thing to do. \r\n\r\nExample code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nInstant instant = Instant.now() ;\r\n\r\nZoneOffset offset = ZoneId.of( &quot;Africa/Dar_es_Salaam&quot; ).getRules().getOffset( instant ) ;\r\nOffsetDateTime odt = OffsetDateTime.now( offset ) ;\r\n\r\nZoneId zone = ZoneId.of( &quot;Africa/Dar_es_Salaam&quot; ) ;\r\nZonedDateTime zonedDateTime = ZonedDateTime.now( zone ) \r\n```\r\nDump to console. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nSystem.out.println( instant + &quot; | &quot; + instant.getEpochSecond() ) ;\r\nSystem.out.println( odt + &quot; | &quot; + odt.toEpochSecond() ) ;\r\nSystem.out.println( zonedDateTime + &quot; | &quot; + zonedDateTime.toEpochSecond() ) ;  \r\n```\r\n\r\nSee this [code run at Ideone.com][5]. Note that all three are within the same second, give or take a second as the clock may rollover to the next second by the second or third call to `now`. \r\n\r\n&gt; 2023-01-24T14:27:06.416597Z | 1674570426\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;2023-01-24T17:27:06.478680+03:00 | 1674570426\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;2023-01-24T17:27:06.487289+03:00[Africa/Dar_es_Salaam] | 1674570426\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# `LocalDateTime#toEpochSecond` \r\n\r\nCalling the `toEpochSecond` method on `LocalDateTime` is tricky conceptually. As a concept, `LocalDateTime` has no [epoch reference][6] point. It is just a date with a time. For example, “noon on January 23 of 2023” by itself has no specific meaning, cannot be nailed down to a point on the timeline. So it is meaningless to compare “noon on January 23 of 2023” to a reference point such as the first moment of 1970 as seen in UTC, 1970-01-01T00:00Z. \r\n\r\nPractically, the `LocalDateTime` class is implemented as if it were in UTC. So internally, the class counts a number of whole seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00Z plus a count of nanoseconds for a fractional second. But you **should not be thinking of this implementation detail when writing code for business logic**. For business logic, calling `LocalDateTime#toEpochSecond`  makes no sense. \r\n\r\n## Technically speaking\r\n\r\nSo the technical answer to your Question is that your delta of 3 hours (1_674_501_451L - 1_674_512_251L) came from the fact that your JVM’s current default time zone at that moment used an offset of +03:00, three hours ahead of UTC. So **your call to `LocalDateTime.now` captured a date and time three hours ahead** of UTC. But then you asked for **`toEpochSecond` which treats that very same date and time as if it were in UTC**. \r\n\r\n## Logically speaking\r\n\r\nOf course that date and time were *not* meant to represent a moment in UTC. So logically speaking, your code is nonsensical. You should not be comparing a count from epoch for a `LocalDateTime` (which is a non-moment) to other classes such as `Instant` (which *is* a moment). \r\n\r\nIn other words, you are [comparing apples and oranges][7]. \r\n\r\n### Serializing date-time data\r\n\r\nSo, if `LocalDateTime#toEpochSecond` is inappropriate for business logic, why does that class offer such a method? \r\n\r\nThat method is useful for serializing a `LocalDateTime` value for storage or data-exchange. Some other systems may present date-with-time values in this manner. \r\n\r\n#### ISO 8601\r\n\r\nHowever, using a count-from-reference is a poor way to communicate date-time values. The values are ambiguous, as their granularity is implicit, and their particular epoch reference point is also implicit. And, such values make validation and debugging difficult for human readers. \r\n\r\nI strongly recommend **using standard [ISO 8601][8] text rather than a count** when storing or exchanging date-time values outside Java. Regarding your example standard textual format would be:\r\n\r\n&gt;2023-01-23T22:17:31\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nGeneral advice: **Avoid `LocalDateTime` class** unless you are *very* clear on its appropriate use.\r\n\r\nFor business apps, we are generally tracking moments. For example, &quot;when does this contract come into effect&quot;, &quot;when was this employee hired&quot;, &quot;when does the purchase of this house close&quot;. So `LocalDateTime` is not called for.\r\n\r\nThe two business scenarios for `LocalDateTime` are (a) making appointments where we want the moment to float if time zone rules change, such as clinic, salon, and studio bookings, and (b) where we mean several moments, each with the same wall-clock time but occurring at different points on the timeline, such as &quot;Announce this corporate message at noon in each of our company factories in Delhi, D&#252;sseldorf, and Detroit.&quot;.

This is a massive improvement, especially when it comes to larger applications, since there are now proxy and reflection object needed that blow up your heap.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":5201756,"reputation":1971,"user_id":4160889,"accept_rate":74,"display_name":"ForeverLearner"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":177,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1674897642,"creation_date":1674896382,"question_id":75266493,"body_markdown":"I am coming from a Spring background.

As others said, if you create one list and assign it to two reference variables (pointers), you still have only one list. Both point to the same list. If you use either pointer to modify the list, both pointers will later see the changes, as there is only one list in memory.\n\nSo you need to make a copy of the list. If you want that copy to be unmodifiable, use the `List.copyOf` method as discussed in this Answer. In this approach, you end up with two separate lists, each with elements that hold a reference to the same content objects. For example, in our example above using `String` objects to represent colors, the color objects are floating around in memory somewhere. The two lists hold pointers to the same color objects. Here is a diagram.\n\n[![enter image description here][6]][6]\n\nThe first list `colors` is modifiable. This means that some elements could be removed as seen in code above, where we removed the original 3rd element `Chartreuse` (index of 2 = ordinal 3). And elements can be added. And the elements can be changed to point to some other `String` such as `OliveDrab` or `CornflowerBlue`. \n\nIn contrast, the four elements of `masterColors` are fixed.

external service from my microservice without zuul][1]][1]\r\n\r\nand this is the image which I receive:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nevery thing is fine until I start Zuul. after starting Zuul, now when I call that external service, I receive response like this (the colored boxes are those ones which are new in the response): \r\n\r\n[![the response which received when zuul is up][3]][3]\r\n\r\nand the received file cannot be displayed and actually it is crashed and corrupted file:\r\n[![corrupt file][4]][4]\r\n\r\nafter using Zuul, two things have been added to the response. `Content-Type` became `image/jpeg;charset=UTF-8` AND there is no `Content-Length` in response anymore and instead, we have `Transfer-Encoding` with `chunked` value. \r\n\r\nI removed the `charset=UTF-8` with this code:\r\n\r\n    spring:\r\n      http:\r\n        encoding:\r\n          charset: utf-8\r\n          force: false\r\n\r\nbut the problem hasn&#39;t solved. so I guess that it might be related to `Transfer-Encoding` with `chunked` value. \r\n\r\nwhat&#39;s wrong with this code? what should I do? why with using Zuul, the received image is damaged?\r\n\r\nThank you (sorry for my bad English)\r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\nI added this line to my application.yml file:\r\n\r\n    zuul.set-content-length=true\r\n\r\nand this is the response:\r\n[![enter image description here][5]][5]\r\n\r\n`Transfer-Encoding` with `chunked` value has been deleted and `Content-Length` has been added to headers BUT the file is still damaged and it took about 10 seconds (the timeout

Studio.\r\n\r\nAnd Jetbrains, please, stop renaming the java location every other year...\r\n\r\n### UPDATE 1\r\nIn the flutter sdk, there&#39;s a file called: `android_studio.dart`. (well there are various android related files, none &quot;java&quot; related, since it seems like Flutter treats Java as an &quot;android thing&quot; (judging by the fact that all java references and validations or checks are performed in `android_` files).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis file is located in `path/to/flutter/packages/flutter_tools/lib/src/android/android_studio.dart`.\r\n\r\nInside it contains this to calculate the path to java:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    final String javaPath = globals.platform.isMacOS ?\r\n        version != null &amp;&amp; version.major &lt; 2020 ?\r\n        globals.fs.path.join(directory, &#39;jre&#39;, &#39;jdk&#39;, &#39;Contents&#39;, &#39;Home&#39;) :\r\n        globals.fs.path.join(directory, &#39;jre&#39;, &#39;Contents&#39;, &#39;Home&#39;) :\r\n        globals.fs.path.join(directory, &#39;jre&#39;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn essence, if you add another entry like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        globals.fs.path.join(directory, &#39;jbr&#39;, &#39;Contents&#39;, &#39;Home&#39;) :\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it ends up looking like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    final String javaPath = globals.platform.isMacOS ?\r\n        version != null &amp;&amp; version.major &lt; 2020 ?\r\n        globals.fs.path.join(directory, &#39;jre&#39;, &#39;jdk&#39;, &#39;Contents&#39;, &#39;Home&#39;) :\r\n        globals.fs.path.join(directory, &#39;jre&#39;, &#39;Contents&#39;, &#39;Home&#39;) :\r\n        globals.fs.path.join(directory, &#39;jbr&#39;, &#39;Contents&#39;, &#39;Home&#39;) :\r\n        globals.fs.path.join(directory, &#39;jre&#39;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can run `flutter doctor` and it may work. \r\n\r\nI also removed the `&amp;&amp; version.major &lt; 2020` part, just to ensure it was always run.
