It is implicitly saying that dependencies on non-abstract class will work.  So from a purely technical perspective, you do not **need** to write / use interfaces or abstract classes to use Spring DI.

The authors of the Spring documentation *think* it is *better* to use interfaces or abstract classes for dependencies that you intend to inject using Spring DI.\r\n\r\nThe stated rationale for the authors opinion is that using interface / abstract classes makes it easier to create tests.  Specifically, you can much more easily use stub or mock implementations of the beans if you are stubbing / mocking an interface or (to a lesser extent) an abstract class.  By contrast, stubbing or mocking `final` classes or classes with `final` methods can be a problem.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s another source that says the same thing:\r\n\r\n  - [Why interfaces are recommended by Spring?](https://techsach.com/why-interfaces-are-recommend-by-spring-framework/)\r\n\r\nNow these are clearly opinions, but they are based on the respective authors&#39; experience.\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nA second rationale for using interfaces is that you may (now or in the future) need to add an alternative bean implementation, and select between the alternatives using DI.

I&#39;ll answer both.\r\n\r\n## The intent is that other projects can extend this system\r\n\r\nThink about `java.util.List`. Yes, this project (The `java.util` package as a project) ships with its own implementations of this interface, including `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`. However, that interface isn&#39;t designed to be limited: If you want to write your own list implementation in your own project you are free to do so, and `List` is _designed_ to allow you to do this. Loads of projects use this: guava has `ImmutableList`, the java core libs itself has plenty of list implementations for example in the `java.util.concurrent` package, and so on.\r\n\r\n__if__ this describes your situation, then the answer is:\r\n\r\nNo, do not make that factory. Just make your implementations public. Yes, this means someone could write:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFooImplA foo = new FooImplA();\r\n```\r\n\r\nand you don&#39;t want them to, but I will free you from such concerns by providing you with this pithy but highly effective zen koan: &quot;You can&#39;t stop an idiotfrom writing idiotic code; the universe is vastly smarter than you and will create a better idiot than you can write defenses to stop them&quot;.\r\n\r\nSo, it is a pointless exercise, and this is freeing: There is no need to try. Make clear from the API, documentation, and examples how you&#39;re meant to do it. If someone is going to ignore all that and &#39;do it wrong&#39;, then let them.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll then be setting the system up precisely the same way `j.u.List` is: You can write this today:\r\n\r\n```\r\nArrayList&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt compiles just fine. One could say you should &#39;program to the interface&#39; but as far as style problems go, this rates _very_ lowly indeed. Mostly this doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s the final nit one would pick in a code review if truly nothing of any substance whatsoever is left to be said.\r\n\r\n## The intent is that you created all the implementations; the system isn&#39;t designed to be extended and you don&#39;t want anybody to try it.\r\n\r\nIn that case, you need to add a bunch of new language features to do this right:\r\n\r\n#### Sealed\r\n\r\nJava20 adds the notion of &#39;sealed interfaces&#39;. A sealed interface (or class) lists every type that is allowed to implement/extend it, and no other types can do it. The aim is for you to list your own implementations and leave it at that. This means you can now __enforce__ that nobody makes custom implementations.\r\n\r\n#### static methods in interfaces\r\n\r\nThe problem with a &#39;factory&#39; the way you have it, is that it hurts discoverability. I know about your interface type and I have a need to create an instance of it. Where do I look? Naturally, first I look __in that interface__, but I find no methods that can make anything. Next, I ask my IDE to show me a list of all types that implement it. My IDE gives me a bunch of private classes hidden deep inside your project that clearly I&#39;m not meant to directly `new Impl()`, so now I&#39;m stuck. I need to read docs (the horror. I kid, but only a little - if the average user of your library just intuits what to do based on nothing more than the names of your types and methods, that&#39;s far better than a system that confuses the heck out of me until I read the docs). Then maybe I see how to do it.\r\n\r\nIn modern java you can shove static methods in interfaces. So, do that:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Foo.java:\r\npublic sealed interface Foo permits FooImplA, FooImplB {\r\n  void doSomething();\r\n\r\n  public static Foo newImplA() {\r\n    return new FooImplA();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public static Foo newImplB() {\r\n    return new FooImplB();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// FooImplA.java:\r\nclass FooImplA implements Foo {\r\n // note how this is a package private class!\r\n ...\r\n\r\n  FooImplA() { ... } // with a package private constructor!\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis solves all problems:\r\n\r\n* Nobody can make implementations of this other than you. You know exactly which subtypes exist, because you enumerated them and that&#39;s unchangable short of recompiling your project or hacking a JVM. (and then, of course, all bets are off. But, remember the universe making better idiots? Universe will do this, too. Nothing you can do to stop it, so don&#39;t bother trying).\r\n* Discoverability is easy, obvious, and complete: Type `Foo.`, hit CTRL+SPACE or whatever the shortcut is, and voila there they are. The java community is used to static &#39;constructors&#39; and knows to look for these when confused about how to make instances of some type.

Records just &#39;get all that stuff&#39;, for free, but at a cost: They are inherently defined by their &#39;parts&#39;. This has all sorts of effects - they cannot extend anything (Because that would mean they are defined by a combination of their parts and the parts their supertype declares, that&#39;s more complex than is intended), and the parts are treated as final, and you can&#39;t make it act like somehow it isn&#39;t actually just a thing that groups together its parts, which is the problem with your code.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s make that &#39;if you try to do it, future language features will ruin your day&#39; aspect of it and focus on deconstruction and the `with` concept.\r\n\r\nYes, this mostly isn&#39;t part of java __yet__, but the record feature is specifically designed to be expanded to encompass deconstruction and all the features that it brings, and work is far along. Specifically, Brian Goetz, who is in charge of this feature and various features that expand on a more holistic idea (records is merely a small part of that idea), really loves this stuff and has repeatedly written about it. Including quite complete feature proposals.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, for records, you are soon going to be able to write this (note, as is usual with OpenJDK feature proposals, don&#39;t focus on the syntax or about concerns such as &#39;.. but, does that mean &#39;with&#39; is now a keyword?&#39; - actual syntax is the very last thing that is fleshed out.\r\n\r\n```\r\nDatePair dp = ....;\r\n\r\nDatePair newDp = dp with {\r\n  days = 20;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe concept of a &#39;deconstruction&#39; is the same as a constructor, but in reverse: Take an object and break it apart into its constituent parts. For records, this is obvious, and in fact (and this is the key, why you can&#39;t do what you want in this way), __baked in__ - records deconstruct by way of the elements you listed for the record (so, here, `start`, `end`, and `days`) and you probably won&#39;t be able to change this.\r\n\r\nThe `obj with {block;}` operation is syntax sugar for:\r\n\r\n* Deconstruct `obj`.\r\n* For each item that the deconstruction has produced, declare a local variable.\r\n* Run `block`. The local vars are available, and aren&#39;t final - change whatever you want.\r\n* Construct a new object of the same type as `obj`, using those local vars to pass to its constructor.\r\n\r\nYour idea can only work if the deconstructor deconstructs solely into `LocalDate start` and `LocalDate end`, leaving `long days` out of it entirely. It would require records to be able to state: Actually, _this_ is my constructor, with different arguments from the record&#39;s component list, and once you open the door to writing your own constructor, you therefore then also __have to__ write your own deconstructor.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, there is no syntax for deconstructors right now. Thus, if records did allow you to write your own constructor (with a different list of params than the record components), that means that if in the future a language feature is released such as `with`, that requires a deconstructor, that some records can&#39;t support it. That&#39;s annoying to the java lang team: They&#39;d love to say: &quot;We introduced `with`, which works with all records already! In the future once we release the deconstructor feature it should also be usable for classes that have a deconstructor&quot;.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, while I can&#39;t say I 100% know exactly what Brian and the OpenJDK team is thinking, I&#39;d be _incredibly_ surprised if they aren&#39;t thinking like the above.\r\n\r\nThe point of the above dive into OpenJDK&#39;s plans for near-future java is to explain that [A] why you can&#39;t make your own constructor in records, and [B] why there won&#39;t be a language feature coming along that will, unless it is part of a set of very significant updates (including deconstructor syntax, and that won&#39;t happen unless there are features that use it).\r\n\r\n## Good news!\r\n\r\nFortunately, there are very simple alternate strategies you can use here.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the best fit for your needs, usable in today&#39;s java:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic record DatePair(LocalDate start, LocalDate end) {\r\n  public long days() {\r\n    return ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(start, end);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis removes `days` from being treated as a component part of DatePair, but then, _that is the point_ - components in records fundamentally can be changed independently of the other parts of it (possibly you can add code that then says the new state is invalid, but now you force folks to set `start` and `days` both simultaneously, you can&#39;t &#39;calculate it out&#39;, which seems like API so bad you wouldn&#39;t want such a thing).\r\n\r\nIt also suffers from the notion that days is now calculated every time instead of being &#39;cached&#39;. You can solve that by writing your own cache e.g. with guava cachebuilder but that&#39;s quite a big bazooka to kill a mosquito. If this truly is the calculation you need, it&#39;s relatively cheap, I&#39;d just write it like this and not worry about performance unless you are holding a profiler report that says this days calculation is the key culprit.\r\n\r\nIf this still isn&#39;t acceptable, then the thing you want just isn&#39;t what `record` represents. You might as well ask how you represent arbitrary strings with an `enum`. You just cannot do that - that is not what enums are about. Hence, you end up at:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport lombok.*;\r\n\r\n@Value\r\n@lombok.experimental.Accessors(fluent = true)\r\npublic class DatePair {\r\n  @With private final LocalDate start, end;\r\n  @With private final long days;\r\n\r\n  public DatePair(LocalDate start, LocalDate end) {\r\n    this.start = start;\r\n    this.end = end;\r\n    this.days = ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(start, end);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI _strongly_ recommend you don&#39;t add the accessors line (this turns `getStart()` into just `start()`. Records notwithstanding, `get` is just better (it plays far better with auto-complete which is ubiquitous in java editor environments, and is more common. In fact, the java core libs themselves do it &#39;right&#39; and use `get`, see e.g. `java.time.LocalDate`). But, if you really really want it - that&#39;s how you do it. Or add a `lombok.config` file and say there that you want fluent style accessor names.\r\n\r\nOr let your IDE generate it all, which will be a ton of code you&#39;ll have to maintain.
