The main panel will return to it&#39;s original color when the mouse is moved out of the selection area.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the GUI when my mouse is in the blue selection area.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n# Explanation\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re not familiar with Java Swing, Oracle has a helpful tutorial, [Creating a GUI With Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/index.html).  Skip the Learning Swing with the NetBeans IDE section.  Pay close attention to the [Concurrency in Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html) and the [Laying Out Components Within a Container](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/index.html) sections.\r\n\r\nWhen I create a Swing GUI, I use the [model/view/controller][3] (MVC) pattern.  This pattern allows me to separate my concerns and focus on one part of the application at a time.\r\n\r\nThe MVC pattern implies that you create the model first, then the view, then the controller.  This is more of an iterative process than a waterfall.\r\n\r\nIn Java Swing, the MVC pattern means:\r\n\r\n1.  The view reads information from the model.\r\n2.  The view may not update the model.\r\n3.  The controller updates the model and repaints / revalidates the view.\r\n\r\nThe model consists of one or more plain Java getter/setter classes.\r\n\r\nThe view consists of a `JFrame` and however many `JPanels` it takes to create the GUI.\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s usually not one controller &quot;to rule them all&quot;.  Each listener acts as an independent controller to manage its part of the model and view.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple application, so it consists of two model classes, one view class, and one controller class.  The model is not updated at all in this example.\r\n\r\nI did not code this entire application at one time.  I wrote a few lines of code and ran tests.  I made lots of changes to the code before I was satisfied with how it worked.\r\n\r\n## Model\r\n\r\nThe `ColorSelection` class is a plain Java getter/setter class that holds the color name, background color, and foreground color.\r\n\r\nThe `MouseMovementModel` class is a plain Java getter/setter class that holds the `ColorSelection` instances.  The GUI builds the selection `JPanel` based on this information.  If you want to add another selection color, you would add it here.\r\n\r\n## View\r\n\r\nThe view consists of a `JFrame`, a selection `JPanel`, and the main `JPanel`.\r\n\r\nThe `JFrame` has a default `BorderLayout`.  The selection `JPanel` goes into the NORTH section and the main `JPanel` goes into the CENTER section.  Only one component can be placed in a section.  That component is usually a `JPanel`.\r\n\r\nThe selection `JPanel` uses a `FlowLayout` to hold the color selection `JPanels`.  The color selection `JPanels` are created based on the number of `ColorSelection` instances in the application model.\r\n\r\nA color selection `JPanel` is a simple `JPanel` created to use the information from a `ColorSelection` instance.\r\n\r\nThe main `JPanel` is a simple `JPanel` that will show a background color.  The controller will be responsible for changing the background color.\r\n\r\n## Controller\r\n\r\nThe `ColorListener` class extends a `MouseAdapter`.  The `MouseAdapter` class implements the `MouseListener`, `MouseMotionListener`, and `MouseWheelListener` interfaces. Using the `MouseAdapter` class allows me to implement just the mouse listener methods I&#39;m writing code for. \r\n\r\nThe `mouseEntered` method sets the main `JPanel` to the `ColorSelection` color.  The code is really simple.

Skip the Learning Swing with the NetBeans IDE section.  Pay close attention to the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Concurrency in Swing</a> and the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Laying Out Components Within a Container</a> sections.</p>\n<p>When I create a Swing GUI, I use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">model/view/controller</a> (MVC) pattern.  This pattern allows me to separate my concerns and focus on one part of the application at a time.</p>\n<p>The MVC pattern implies that you create the model first, then the view, then the controller.  This is more of an iterative process than a waterfall.</p>\n<p>In Java Swing, the MVC pattern means:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The view reads information from the model.</li>\n<li>The view may not update the model.</li>\n<li>The controller updates the model and repaints / revalidates the view.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The model consists of one or more plain Java getter/setter classes.</p>\n<p>The view consists of a <code>JFrame</code> and however many <code>JPanels</code> it takes to create the GUI.</p>\n<p>There's usually not one controller &quot;to rule them all&quot;.  Each listener acts as an independent controller to manage its part of the model and view.</p>\n<p>This is a simple application, so it consists of two model classes, one view class, and one controller class.  The model is not updated at all in this example.</p>\n<p>I did not code this entire application at one time.  I wrote a few lines of code and ran tests.  I made lots of changes to the code before I was satisfied with how it worked.</p>\n<h2>Model</h2>\n<p>The <code>ColorSelection</code> class is a plain Java getter/setter class that holds the color name, background color, and foreground color.</p>\n<p>The <code>MouseMovementModel</code> class is a plain Java getter/setter class that holds the <code>ColorSelection</code> instances.  The GUI builds the selection <code>JPanel</code> based on this information.  If you want to add another selection color, you would add it here.</p>\n<h2>View</h2>\n<p>The view consists of a <code>JFrame</code>, a selection <code>JPanel</code>, and the main <code>JPanel</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>JFrame</code> has a default <code>BorderLayout</code>.  The selection <code>JPanel</code> goes into the NORTH section and the main <code>JPanel</code> goes into the CENTER section.  Only one component can be placed in a section.  That component is usually a <code>JPanel</code>.</p>\n<p>The selection <code>JPanel</code> uses a <code>FlowLayout</code> to hold the color selection <code>JPanels</code>.  The color selection <code>JPanels</code> are created based on the number of <code>ColorSelection</code> instances in the application model.</p>\n<p>A color selection <code>JPanel</code> is a simple <code>JPanel</code> created to use the information from a <code>ColorSelection</code> instance.</p>\n<p>The main <code>JPanel</code> is a simple <code>JPanel</code> that will show a background color.  The controller will be responsible for changing the background color.</p>\n<h2>Controller</h2>\n<p>The <code>ColorListener</code> class extends a <code>MouseAdapter</code>.  The <code>MouseAdapter</code> class implements the <code>MouseListener</code>, <code>MouseMotionListener</code>, and <code>MouseWheelListener</code> interfaces. Using the <code>MouseAdapter</code> class allows me to implement just the mouse listener methods I'm writing code for.</p>\n<p>The <code>mouseEntered</code> method sets the main <code>JPanel</code> to the <code>ColorSelection</code> color.  The code is really simple.  It updates the view with the <code>ColorSelection</code> background color.</p>\n<p>The <code>mouseExited</code> method sets the main <code>JPanel</code> back to its original color.</p>\n<h1>Code</h1>\n<p>Here's the complete runnable code.

If you are calculating the FFT over a large duration you might find that it does take a while depending on how many frequency points you are wanting. However, in most cases for audio it is considered non-stationary (that is the signals mean and variance changes to much over time), so taking one large FFT ([Periodogram PSD][1] estimate) is not an accurate representation. Alternatively you could use Short-time Fourier transform, whereby you break the signal up into smaller frames and calculate the FFT. The frame size varies depending on how quickly the statistics change, for speech it is usually 20-40ms, for music I assume it is slightly higher.\r\n\r\nThis method is good if you are sampling from the microphone, because it allows you to buffer each frame at a time, calculate the fft and give what the user feels is &quot;real time&quot; interaction. Because 20ms is quick, because we can&#39;t really perceive a time difference that small.\r\n\r\nI developed a small bench mark to test the difference between FFTW and KissFFT c-libraries on a speech signal. Yes FFTW is highly optimised, but when you are taking only short-frames, updating the data for the user, and using only a small fft size, they are both very similar.

The frame size varies depending on how quickly the statistics change, for speech it is usually 20-40ms, for music I assume it is slightly higher.</p>\n\n<p>This method is good if you are sampling from the microphone, because it allows you to buffer each frame at a time, calculate the fft and give what the user feels is \"real time\" interaction. Because 20ms is quick, because we can't really perceive a time difference that small.</p>\n\n<p>I developed a small bench mark to test the difference between FFTW and KissFFT c-libraries on a speech signal. Yes FFTW is highly optimised, but when you are taking only short-frames, updating the data for the user, and using only a small fft size, they are both very similar. Here is an example on how to implement the <a href=\"http://www.digiphd.com/android-java-simple-fft-libgdx/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">KissFFT libraries in Android</a> using LibGdx by badlogic games. I implemented this library using overlapping frames in an Android App I developed a few months ago called <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enhancement\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Speech Enhancement for Android</a>.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":133437,"reputation":3626,"user_id":334807,"accept_rate":91,"display_name":"InsertNickHere"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":115267,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":57,"closed_date":1386306064,"accepted_answer_id":3287544,"answer_count":5,"score":56,"last_activity_date":1695936483,"creation_date":1279607101,"question_id":3287518,"body_markdown":"since I don&#39;t want to do it on my own, I am searching for a good FFT implementation for java.

My final code looks like this (Kotlin, in production code I have strings in constants of course ;) ):</p>\n\n<pre><code>val domain = myPageUri.host\nCookieManager.getInstance().apply {\n   getCookie(domain)\n      .split(\"; \")\n      .filter { it.isNotNullOrBlank() }\n      .forEach {\n         val newCookieValue = it.substringBefore(\"=\") + \"=; Max-Age=-1\"\n         setCookie(domain, newCookieValue)\n      }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>substringBefore(character: String)</code> is just our extension function on <code>String</code> to return substring from start to first occurrence of <code>character</code>.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2162613,"reputation":9277,"user_id":1916449,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"arekolek"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1680608282,"creation_date":1680608282,"answer_id":75928902,"question_id":35390590,"body_markdown":"Other answers didn&#39;t work for me, because they didn&#39;t set the correct path for the cookie.\r\n\r\nWhat seems to work for me:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nimport android.webkit.CookieManager\r\nimport okhttp3.HttpUrl.Companion.toHttpUrl\r\n\r\nfun CookieManager.removeCookies(url: String) {\r\n    val cookies = getCookie(url) ?: return\r\n\r\n    // Android SDK will not tell us what path was used to set the cookie, so we remove the cookie for all possible paths\r\n    val paths = url.toHttpUrl().encodedPathSegments.scan(&quot;/&quot;) { prefix, segment -&gt; &quot;$prefix$segment/&quot; }\r\n\r\n    val keys = cookies.split(&quot;;&quot;)\r\n            .map { it.substringBefore(&quot;=&quot;, missingDelimiterValue = &quot;&quot;).trim() }\r\n            .filter { it.isNotEmpty() }\r\n            .distinct()\r\n\r\n    keys.forEach { key -&gt;\r\n        paths.forEach {\r\n            // Max-Age effectively removes the cookie\r\n            setCookie(url, &quot;$key=; Path=$it; Max-Age=-1&quot;)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","title":"Remove all cookies from specific domain in web view","body":"<p>Other answers didn't work for me, because they didn't set the correct path for the cookie.</p>\n<p>What seems to work for me:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-kotlin prettyprint-override\"><code>import android.webkit.CookieManager\nimport okhttp3.HttpUrl.Companion.toHttpUrl\n\nfun CookieManager.removeCookies(url: String) {\n    val cookies = getCookie(url) ?: return\n\n    // Android SDK will not tell us what path was used to set the cookie, so we remove the cookie for all possible paths\n    val paths = url.toHttpUrl().encodedPathSegments.scan(&quot;/&quot;) { prefix, segment -&gt; &quot;$prefix$segment/&quot; }\n\n    val keys = cookies.split(&quot;;&quot;)\n            .map { it.substringBefore(&quot;=&quot;, missingDelimiterValue = &quot;&quot;).trim() }\n            .filter { it.isNotEmpty() }\n            .distinct()\n\n    keys.forEach { key -&gt;\n        paths.forEach {\n            // Max-Age effectively removes the cookie\n            setCookie(url, &quot;$key=; Path=$it; Max-Age=-1&quot;)\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":6908419,"reputation":343,"user_id":5305285,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"nahum"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":11139,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":9,"accepted_answer_id":35402092,"answer_count":5,"score":8,"last_activity_date":1695928282,"creation_date":1455444700,"question_id":35390590,"body_markdown":"I am trying to remove all the cookies from some domain, is there a way to do this?\r\n\r\nThe only method i saw is removeAllCookies.\r\n\r\nThank you.

But eventually we're going to expand the team and I want things to be smooth and intuitive (as much as possible given the circumstances) when they get here.</p>\n<p>Note: I've looked through similar questions and I don't think any of them are asking the same thing that I am. I know how to exclude nodes from the <strong>results</strong> of an XPath search, but I'm trying to remove those nodes from the search entirely. Thank you so much if you're able to offer any suggestions!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","selenium","xpath","webdriver","element"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":701757,"reputation":121151,"user_id":592139,"display_name":"Ian Roberts"},"score":0,"creation_date":1397474968,"post_id":23058789,"comment_id":35234983,"body_markdown":"You&#39;ve got a typo - there&#39;s an extra trailing `]` after `text()` that shouldn&#39;t be there.

Right-click on the Queue Manager, and select properties/SSL. Check `SSL Key repository` and `Certificate label`.  \r\n\r\n- Backup and delete the old files related to the SSL configured for the Queue Manager. For example, if the value of `SSL Key repository` is `C:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\MQ\\qmgrs\\mq-manager-name\\ssl\\mykeystore`, then back up and delete the following files:\r\n```\r\nmykeystore.jks\r\nmykeystore.kdb\r\nmykeystore.rdb\r\nmykeystore.sth   (the password stash file)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Copy the keystore file created above from the client machine to the above-mentioned folder on MQ Server.\r\n\r\n- Create the new .kdb and .rdb files using the runmqckm.exe command from IBM MQ (usually found in `C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\MQ\\bin`):\r\n```\r\nC:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\MQ\\qmgrs\\mq-manager-name\\ssl&gt; runmqckm -keydb -convert -db mykeystore.jks -new_format kdb\r\n5724-H72 (C) Copyright IBM Corp. 1994, 2017.\r\nA password is required to access the source key database.\r\nPlease enter a password: &lt;keystore-password&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Create the new stash .sth password file\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\ProgramData\\IBM\\MQ\\qmgrs\\mq-manager-name\\ssl&gt; runmqckm -keydb -stashpw -db mykeystore.kdb\r\n5724-H72 (C) Copyright IBM Corp. 1994, 2017.\r\nA password is required to access the source key database.\r\nPlease enter a password: &lt;keystore-password&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n- From MQ Explorer, right-click on the Queue Manager, and select Properties/SSL.

The code converts the input string &quot;1970-01-01&quot; to localizedTimeStamp (via  from_utc_timestamp)  and verifies that  the &#39;valueOf&#39; of that time stamp is the same as &quot;1970-01-01 00:00:00&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\n    object TimeTravails {\r\n      def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\r\n\r\n        import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\r\n        import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\n\r\n        val spark: SparkSession = SparkSession.builder()\r\n          .master(&quot;local[3]&quot;)\r\n          .appName(&quot;SparkByExample&quot;)\r\n          .getOrCreate()\r\n\r\n        spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel(&quot;ERROR&quot;)\r\n\r\n        import spark.implicits._\r\n        import java.sql.Timestamp\r\n\r\n        def timeTricks(timezone: String): Unit =  {\r\n          val df2 = List(&quot;1970-01-01&quot;).toDF(&quot;timestr&quot;). // can use to_timestamp even without time parts !\r\n            withColumn(&quot;timestamp&quot;, to_timestamp(&#39;timestr, &quot;yyyy-MM-dd&quot;)).\r\n            withColumn(&quot;localizedTimestamp&quot;, from_utc_timestamp(&#39;timestamp, timezone)).\r\n            withColumn(&quot;weekday&quot;, date_format($&quot;localizedTimestamp&quot;, &quot;EEEE&quot;))\r\n          val row = df2.first()\r\n          println(&quot;with timezone: &quot; + timezone)\r\n          df2.show()\r\n          val (timestamp, weekday) = (row.getAs[Timestamp](&quot;localizedTimestamp&quot;), row.getAs[String](&quot;weekday&quot;))\r\n\r\n          timezone match {\r\n            case &quot;UTC&quot; =&gt;\r\n              assert(timestamp ==  Timestamp.valueOf(&quot;1970-01-01 00:00:00&quot;)  &amp;&amp; weekday == &quot;Thursday&quot;)\r\n            case &quot;PST&quot; | &quot;GMT-8&quot; | &quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;  =&gt;\r\n              assert(timestamp ==  Timestamp.valueOf(&quot;1969-12-31 16:00:00&quot;)  &amp;&amp; weekday == &quot;Wednesday&quot;)\r\n            case  &quot;Asia/Tokyo&quot; =&gt;\r\n              assert(timestamp ==  Timestamp.valueOf(&quot;1970-01-01 09:00:00&quot;)  &amp;&amp; weekday == &quot;Thursday&quot;)\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        timeTricks(&quot;UTC&quot;)\r\n        timeTricks(&quot;PST&quot;)\r\n        timeTricks(&quot;GMT-8&quot;)\r\n        timeTricks(&quot;Asia/Tokyo&quot;)\r\n        timeTricks(&quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot;)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n**Solution to problem of Structured Streaming Interpreting incoming date[/time] strings as UTC (not local time)**\r\n\r\nThe code below illustrates how to apply the above tricks (with a slight modification) so as to correct  the problem of timestamps being shifted by the offset  between local time and GMT.  \r\n\r\n    object Struct {\r\n      import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\r\n      import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\n\r\n      def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\r\n\r\n        val timezone = &quot;PST&quot;\r\n\r\n        val spark: SparkSession = SparkSession.builder()\r\n          .master(&quot;local[3]&quot;)\r\n          .appName(&quot;SparkByExample&quot;)\r\n          .getOrCreate()\r\n\r\n        spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel(&quot;ERROR&quot;)\r\n\r\n        val df = spark.readStream\r\n          .format(&quot;socket&quot;)\r\n          .option(&quot;host&quot;, &quot;localhost&quot;)\r\n          .option(&quot;port&quot;, &quot;9999&quot;)\r\n          .load()\r\n\r\n        import spark.implicits._\r\n\r\n\r\n        val splitDf = df.select(split(df(&quot;value&quot;), &quot; &quot;).as(&quot;arr&quot;)).\r\n          select($&quot;arr&quot; (0).as(&quot;tsString&quot;), $&quot;arr&quot; (1).as(&quot;count&quot;)).\r\n          withColumn(&quot;timestamp&quot;, to_timestamp($&quot;tsString&quot;, &quot;yyyy-MM-dd&quot;))\r\n        val grouped = splitDf.groupBy(window($&quot;timestamp&quot;, &quot;1 day&quot;, &quot;1 day&quot;).as(&quot;date_window&quot;)).count()\r\n\r\n        val tunedForDisplay =\r\n          grouped.\r\n            withColumn(&quot;windowStart&quot;, to_utc_timestamp($&quot;date_window.start&quot;, timezone)).\r\n            withColumn(&quot;windowEnd&quot;, to_utc_timestamp($&quot;date_window.end&quot;, timezone))\r\n\r\n        tunedForDisplay.writeStream\r\n          .format(&quot;console&quot;)\r\n          .outputMode(&quot;update&quot;)\r\n          .option(&quot;truncate&quot;, false)\r\n          .start()\r\n          .awaitTermination()\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code requires input be fed via socket...

You are left with directories which do not exist and IDE never updated the caches to reflect the same in following builds. Thus, even if after cleaning and rebuilding, error persist. Hope this helps. </p>\n\n<p>In Android Studio, goto FILE -> Invalidate Cache and Restart.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":10694367,"reputation":1404,"user_id":7872110,"display_name":"Islam Assem"},"score":12,"creation_date":1576738048,"post_id":57473137,"comment_id":104997349,"body_markdown":"deletin .gradle folder and invalidating solved it as no one can disable databinding","body":"deletin .gradle folder and invalidating solved it as no one can disable databinding"},{"owner":{"account_id":5110862,"reputation":407,"user_id":6004674,"display_name":"Zakir Shikhli"},"score":6,"creation_date":1598081975,"post_id":57473137,"comment_id":112346726,"body_markdown":"Even just deleting &quot;.gradle&quot; folder was enough for me.","body":"Even just deleting &quot;.gradle&quot; folder was enough for me."}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4596871,"reputation":87,"user_id":3728638,"display_name":"Pedram"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":9,"is_accepted":false,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1565689783,"creation_date":1565681702,"answer_id":57473137,"question_id":32733565,"body_markdown":"The following worked for me:\r\n\r\n1.

Using a custom HostnameVerifier seems to get totally ignored. Is this a Java bug?\r\n\r\nUpdate 11.05.2019\r\n\r\nA bug report has been opened: https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=JDK-8223677\r\n\r\nEdit 12.05.2019\r\n\r\nAs dave_thompson_085 correctly points out, the behaviour is the same in Java 8 and Java 11: the exception is alwas thrown.\r\n\r\nThe only way to get around this issue up to Java 8 was using org.apache.http, but this does not work on newer Java versions like Java 11:\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage test;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.IOException;\r\nimport java.security.cert.CertificateException;\r\nimport java.security.cert.X509Certificate;\r\n\r\nimport javax.net.ssl.SSLContext;\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.http.HttpEntity;\r\nimport org.apache.http.client.ClientProtocolException;\r\nimport org.apache.http.client.methods.CloseableHttpResponse;\r\nimport org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpGet;\r\nimport org.apache.http.client.protocol.HttpClientContext;\r\nimport org.apache.http.config.Registry;\r\nimport org.apache.http.config.RegistryBuilder;\r\nimport org.apache.http.conn.HttpConnectionFactory;\r\nimport org.apache.http.conn.ManagedHttpClientConnection;\r\nimport org.apache.http.conn.routing.HttpRoute;\r\nimport org.apache.http.conn.socket.ConnectionSocketFactory;\r\nimport org.apache.http.conn.socket.PlainConnectionSocketFactory;\r\nimport org.apache.http.conn.ssl.NoopHostnameVerifier;\r\nimport org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLConnectionSocketFactory;\r\nimport org.apache.http.impl.client.BasicCookieStore;\r\nimport org.apache.http.impl.client.CloseableHttpClient;\r\nimport org.apache.http.impl.client.HttpClients;\r\nimport org.apache.http.impl.conn.DefaultHttpResponseParserFactory;\r\nimport org.apache.http.impl.conn.ManagedHttpClientConnectionFactory;\r\nimport org.apache.http.impl.conn.PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager;\r\nimport org.apache.http.impl.io.DefaultHttpRequestWriterFactory;\r\nimport org.apache.http.ssl.SSLContextBuilder;\r\nimport org.apache.http.ssl.TrustStrategy;\r\nimport org.apache.http.util.EntityUtils;\r\n\r\nimport util.NoSNISSLSocketFactory;\r\n\r\npublic class TestSNI {\r\n\r\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t HttpEntity entity = null;\r\n\r\n\t        try {\r\n\r\n\t            final BasicCookieStore cookieStore = new BasicCookieStore();\r\n\t            final HttpClientContext localContext = HttpClientContext.create();\r\n\t            localContext.setCookieStore(cookieStore);\r\n\t            \r\n                // accept all certificates\r\n                final SSLContext sslContext = new SSLContextBuilder().loadTrustMaterial(null, new TrustStrategy() {\r\n                    public boolean isTrusted(final X509Certificate[] arg0, final String arg1)\r\n                            throws CertificateException {\r\n                        return true;\r\n                    }\r\n                }).build();\r\n                \r\n                // set NoopHostnameVerifier()\r\n                final Registry&lt;ConnectionSocketFactory&gt;

8?\r\n\r\nEdit 12.05.2019\r\n\r\nFurther debugging reveals that NoopHostnameVerifier, which overrides the method verify from javax.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier to return alwas true, is NOT called on Java 11. The exception already occurs in NoSNISSLSocketFactory, which extends SSLSocketFactory with an empty host:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Override\r\n    public Socket createSocket(final Socket socket, final String host, final int port, final boolean autoClose)\r\n            throws IOException {\r\n        return sslSocketFactory.createSocket(socket, &quot;&quot;, port, autoClose);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nSo it appears that on Java 8 creating a Socket with an empty host did disable SNI, while on Java 11 this seems not to be the case?","title":"received handshake warning: unrecognized_name","body":"<p>Is there a way to deal in Java 11 with a \"javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: received handshake warning: unrecognized_name\" without disabling SNI system wide by using</p>\n\n<p><code>System.setProperty(\"jsse.enableSNIExtension\", \"false\")</code></p>\n\n<p>Using this system property would cause any following request to a host depending on SNI to fail.

The exception already occurs in NoSNISSLSocketFactory, which extends SSLSocketFactory with an empty host:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    @Override\n    public Socket createSocket(final Socket socket, final String host, final int port, final boolean autoClose)\n            throws IOException {\n        return sslSocketFactory.createSocket(socket, \"\", port, autoClose);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So it appears that on Java 8 creating a Socket with an empty host did disable SNI, while on Java 11 this seems not to be the case?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","junit","quartz-scheduler"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"display_name":"user1615691"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1368022883,"creation_date":1368022883,"answer_id":16443158,"question_id":5321044,"body_markdown":"You can add a code section :`while (true) {}` to avoid JUnit thread ends.
