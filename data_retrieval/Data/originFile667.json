The case is that I have 2 application instances (primary and secondary) and I would like to try to send messages from primary to secondary as long as some condition is not met. In this way I want to implement resiliency - when there is no internet on primary's network - try sending the same message over and over. Let's say it is some boolean flag. I would like to achieve something like that (in pseudocode):</p>\n<pre><code>while(condition not met)\nboolean messageSendingSuccess = tryToSendMessage(secondaryAddress);\nif(messageSendingSuccess) return;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In reality I would like to create the whole queue of messages and implement the solution for the whole queue of messages (until the first message is sent - wait. when first message is sent - start trying to send new message etc.), but this is the scenario for one message.</p>\n<p>How can I achieve that? I know that CircuitBreaker will not help me here <a href=\"https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-circuit-breaker/java/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-circuit-breaker/java/</a> because it is trying to reconnect given number of times. I do not want to stop trying after given number of times or after some time - I would like to stop trying when some condition is met.\nThe solution from this webpage looks interesting:\n<a href=\"https://blog.axway.com/product-insights/amplify-platform/application-integration/vert-x-how-to-handle-retry-with-the-eventbus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://blog.axway.com/product-insights/amplify-platform/application-integration/vert-x-how-to-handle-retry-with-the-eventbus</a> but I think this solution is only for communicating inside the application (not to communicate through the network) - I do not see where could I point out the network address where I should send the message in this code?</p>\n<pre><code>public class RetryWithHandlerVerticle extends AbstractVerticle {\n      @Override\n      public void start() throws Exception {\n         vertx.eventBus() // (1)\n              .send(&quot;hello.handler.failure.retry&quot;, // (2) \n                    &quot;Hello&quot;, // (3) \n                     new Handler&lt;AsyncResult&lt;Message&lt;String&gt;&gt;&gt;() { // (4)\n                        private int count = 1;\n                        @Override\n                        public void handle(final AsyncResult&lt;Message&lt;String&gt;&gt; aResult) {\n                           if (aResult.succeeded()) { // (5)\n                              System.out.printf(&quot;received: \\&quot;%s\\&quot;\\n&quot;, aResult.result().body()); \n                           } else if (count &lt; 3) { // (6)\n                              System.out.printf(&quot;retry count %d, received error \\&quot;%s\\&quot;\\n&quot;, \n                                                count, aResult.cause().getMessage());\n                              vertx.eventBus().send(&quot;hello.handler.failure.retry&quot;, &quot;Hello&quot;, this); // (7)\n                              count = count + 1;\n                           } else {\n                              aResult.cause().printStackTrace(); // (8)\n                           }\n                        }\n              });\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","android-studio","android-scrollview"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":18365379,"reputation":117,"user_id":13376540,"display_name":"OneKe"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1675785128,"creation_date":1675785128,"answer_id":75375860,"question_id":75375782,"body_markdown":"The issue with the ScrollView not scrolling might be due to the height of the ScrollView and the LinearLayout inside it.

The new way as per the <a href=\"http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-data-access.html#howto-configure-jpa-properties\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Spring Boot documentation</a> is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.implicit-strategy=org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.ImplicitNamingStrategyComponentPathImpl\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also, you must not use <code>@Id</code> within an <code>@Embeddable</code>. I thus created a seperate <code>@MappedSuperclass</code> for embeddables:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@MappedSuperclass\npublic abstract class A {\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue\n    long id;\n}\n\n@MappedSuperclass\npublic abstract class E {\n    @GeneratedValue\n    long id;\n}\n\n@Embeddable\npublic class B extends E {\n\n}\n\n@Entity\npublic class C extends A {\n    B b;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This way, the table <code>C</code> has two columns <code>id</code> and <code>b_id</code>. The downside is of course that <code>A</code> and <code>E</code> introduce some redundency.

The whole <code>TypeToken</code> hack works because <code>Class#getGenericSuperclass()</code> does the following</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Returns the Type representing the direct superclass of the entity\n(class, interface, primitive type or void) represented by this Class.</p>\n<p>If the superclass is a parameterized type, the Type object returned\nmust accurately reflect the actual type parameters used in the source\ncode.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, if it sees <code>ArrayList&lt;T&gt;</code>, that's the <code>ParameterizedType</code> it will return and you won't be able to extract the compile time value that the type variable <code>T</code> would have had.</p>\n<p><code>Type</code> and <code>ParameterizedType</code> are both interfaces. You can provide an instance of your own implementation (define a class that implements either interface and overrides its methods) or use one of the <a href=\"https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">helpful factory methods that <code>TypeToken</code> provides in its latest versions</a>.
