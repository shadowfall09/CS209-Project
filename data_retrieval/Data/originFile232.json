is in a state where it deploys but the JUnit tests fail and some features of it also fail, so far I&#39;ve narrowed it down to a problem of parsing `LocalDateTime` from `Json`.\r\n\r\nSo basically, I got this problem repeated several times, I am expecting as request body an object with LocalDateTime fields i.e:\r\n\r\n\r\n    @Schema(\r\n            name = &quot;shopOrderDate&quot;,\r\n

JsonFormat.Shape.STRING, pattern = &quot;yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss&quot;)\r\n    private LocalDateTime shopOrderDate;\r\n\r\nThe problem is that both tests and calls I do on my own fail and throw the following error:\r\n\r\n    &quot;Cannot deserialize value of type `java.time.LocalDateTime` from String \\&quot;2021-02-05 10:11:22\\&quot;: Failed to deserialize java.time.LocalDateTime:

to see if there are wierd characters there but there aren&#39;t, and that part was unchanged in the migration process so I don&#39;t really think that&#39;s the problem.\r\n\r\nCan anyone see what the

Java 11, and the application is in a state where it deploys but the JUnit tests fail and some features of it also fail, so far I've narrowed it down to a problem of parsing <code>LocalDateTime</code> from <code>Json</code>.</p>\n<p>So basically, I got this problem repeated several times, I am expecting as request body an object with LocalDateTime fields i.e:</p>\n<pre><code>@Schema(\n        name = &quot;shopOrderDate&quot;,\n        example = &quot;2018-10-04 12:24:06&quot;,\n        title = &quot;The timestamp when this order was created.&quot;,\n        required = true)\n@NotNull\n@JsonFormat(shape = JsonFormat.Shape.STRING, pattern = &quot;yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss&quot;)\nprivate LocalDateTime shopOrderDate;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The problem is that both tests and calls I do on my own fail and throw the following error:</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;Cannot deserialize value of type `java.time.LocalDateTime` from String \\&quot;2021-02-05 10:11:22\\&quot;: Failed to

the date and the time and I've looked to see if there are wierd characters there but there aren't, and that part was unchanged in the migration process so I don't really think that's the problem.</p>\n<p>Can anyone see what the problem is?</p>\n<p>EDIT: This is the Stacktrace</p>\n<pre><code>com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidFormatException: Cannot deserialize value of type

Any ideas?"},{"owner":{"account_id":398094,"reputation":636,"user_id":762588,"display_name":"Viktor Seifert"},"score":0,"creation_date":1388102629,"post_id":20637445,"comment_id":31170641,"body_markdown":"@Ray.R.Chua Can you check that you have correctly set the edge length and recompiled?

It was fixed in Version 4.0.0. But Apache POI will not fix bugs in prevoius version&#39;s code.

Like this</p>\n \n<pre><code> &lt;resources&gt;\n &lt;style name=&quot;Theme.TrackMyBaby&quot; parent=&quot;Theme.AppCompat.Light&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;!-- ... theme attributes ... --&gt;\n &lt;/style&gt;\n</code></pre>\n \n</li>\n<li><p>Just in case you can define a theme in <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> for your <code>KickTrend</code> activity.</p>\n<pre><code> &lt;!-- AndroidManifest.xml --&gt;\n &lt;activity\n     android:name=&quot;.KickTrend&quot;\n     android:theme=&quot;@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light&quot;&gt;\n &lt;/activity&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":5696321,"reputation":165,"user_id":4502721,"accept_rate":33,"display_name":"Amrita Deb"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":76959601,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1692779232,"creation_date":1692777370,"question_id":76959395,"body_markdown":"This should be simple but I am not sure what I am doing wrong. \r\nI want my code to go from one activity to another when a button is clicked.\r\n\r\nThe current activity is called MainActivity and the activity it redirects to is called &#39;KickTrend&#39;\r\n\r\n\r\n    class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {\r\n        override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\r\n            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\r\n            setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)\r\n            val trend_btn : Button = findViewById(R.id.viewTrend)\r\n            trend_btn.setOnClickListener {\r\n                val intent = Intent(this,KickTrend::class.java)\r\n                Toast.makeText(this, &quot;moving to new Activity&quot;, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()\r\n                startActivity(intent)\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe toast is showing up but the then the app crashes at `startActivity(intent)` line\r\nThe Kick Trend activity kotlin file looks like this:\r\n\r\n    class KickTrend : AppCompatActivity() {\r\n        override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\r\n            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\r\n            setContentView(R.layout.activity_kick_trend)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nCan anyone tell me what i am doing wrong.

The latter __is a lie__ - it does not represent dates at all. It represents time since the epoch without a timezone, and in that sense, the direct equivalent in the `java.time` package is in fact `java.time.Instant`, and it&#39;s best to think of them that way.\r\n\r\nGiven that the `java.util` time types (and therefore, all the `java.sql` time types too, given that they all extend `j.u.Date`!) are essentially broken due to being confused about their nature (such as `Date` being named, well, `Date`), you shouldn&#39;t use these types. Anywhere. Ever.\r\n\r\n## Do it right\r\n\r\nFortunately, you don&#39;t have to use the broken types. There is no need to mess with `java.sql.Timestamp`. __Ever__. The JDBC5 spec __requires__ that JDBC drivers support the `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, and `OffsetDateTime` modern `java.time` types for, respectively, SQL types `DATE`, `TIME WITHOUT TIMEZONE`, `TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIMEZONE` and `TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE`. Thus, let&#39;s say you have a table named `person` with a column named `birthdate` of type `DATE`, you might currently have this kind of code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ntry (\r\n  var preparedStatement = con.prepareStatement(&quot;SELECT birthdate FROM person&quot;;\r\n  var query = preparedStatement.executeQuery()) {\r\n\r\n  while (query.next()) {\r\n    java.sql.Date d = query.getDate(1);  \r\n    doStuffWith(d);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat code is obsolete and dangerous. Instead, replace the offending line (that calls `.getDate`) with:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.time.LocalDate d = query.getObject(1, LocalDate.class):\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe javadoc of `getObject` states that whether the type you pass &#39;works&#39; depends on the JDBC driver, but as mentioned, a JDBC5 compatible driver is __required__ to support it.\r\n\r\nYou can use `.setObject()` (when filling values for PreparedStatements, or INSERTing data) too, passing a `LocalDate` instance.\r\n\r\nThis avoids all issues.\r\n\r\n## A direct answer to your question\r\n\r\nYou really should skip this section and just do it right. Find all calls to `getTimestamp`, `getDate`, `setTimestamp`, `setDate`, etc - and fix them properly.\r\n\r\nBecause the __correct__ answer to your question is: Nevermind, you need to go one level deeper and stop using this stuff.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the interests of satisfying curiosity:\r\n\r\n&gt; ```java\r\n&gt; Timestamp stamp = new Timestamp(123, 7, 1, 10, 0, 0, 0); //this &gt; represents 2023-08-01 10:00:00 (UTC)\r\n&gt;stamp.toInstant() //returns 2023-08-01 08:00:00\r\n&gt; ```\r\n\r\nNo, this is all very incorrect. Your understanding of dates and times is wrong.\r\n\r\nA Timestamp  __cannot__ represent human-reckoning (which is years, months, days, and so on). It represents millis-since-epoch and the notion of referring to some millis-since-epoch values in terms of days, hours, minutes (and a UTC timezone) is a human invention that is subtly incorrect. That&#39;s not how it works under the hood. And when you lose sight of that, you get confused.\r\n\r\nInstant is the same thing: It represents millis-since-epoch __and not days, months, hours, etc__. Hence, _any interaction with these types in terms of human reckoning, be it that constructor you are invoking where you pass human-reckoning, or that `toString()` output of `Instant`, is merely for human convenience, is likely to confuse, and is the result of an internal conversion at point of contact - internally nothing is stored as human reckoning with these types!_\r\n\r\nKnowing that we can figure out why you are getting &#39;weird&#39; results: The human reckoning constructor of `java.sql.Timestamp` &#39;helpfully&#39; assumes you are writing your human reckoning in the platform default timezone (which, evidently, for your system, currently has +02:00 offset relative to UTC, i.e. most of mainland europe in summer for example).\r\n\r\nHence, it dutifully converts your human reckoning to that millis-since-epoch value that represents that exact moment in time when asking someone in Brussels &#39;hey, can you give me the date and time?&#39; would result in the answer: &quot;Sure mate! It&#39;s 2023, august 1st, and it&#39;s 10:00 in the morning exactly!&quot; and stores that. It doesn&#39;t store timezones, and it doesn&#39;t store the notion of &#39;10 o clock&#39;. It just stores that big number: Your object has one field with value `1690876800000` _and that is all it has_ (oversimplifying a bit, there are more fields, but they don&#39;t meaningfully affect this conclusion). It doesn&#39;t store the timezone and it doesn&#39;t store the human reckoning version (2023/08/01/10/00/00).\r\n\r\nYou then ask it to print itself, which causes it to convert 1690876800000 right back to human reckoning form. As you didn&#39;t provide a timezone when asking it to print itself, and it doesn&#39;t store one, the behaviour depends on what you&#39;re doing:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntheInstanceOfJavaSqlTimestamp.toString()\r\n```\r\n\r\nproduces the string value &quot;2023-08-01 10:00:00.0&quot;, and it does this because its toString _also_ &#39;helpfully&#39; uses your platform default timezone which is still `Europe/Amsterdam`. This might make you think it dutifully stored &#39;10 o clock&#39; - it didn&#39;t.\r\n\r\nInstead, Instant is &#39;better&#39; in that it tries to avoid the confusion and avoids creating the impression it is storing timestamp info:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntheInstanceOfJavaSqlTimestamp.toInstant().toString()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `toInstant()` call just gives you an instant whose one field with epoch-millis still has the same 1690876800000 value stored inside. However, _its_ `toString()` impl chooses to render this value to your eyeballs by converting it on-the-fly to human reckoning just like `java.sql.Timestamp`&#39;s toString(), but it uses UTC instead of &#39;platform local timezone&#39;.\r\n\r\n__That doesn&#39;t change this simple fact: These 2 objects represent the exact same instant in time__. It&#39;s just different takes on &#39;how should the `toString()` method show useful information to a human debugger&#39;.\r\n\r\n&gt; What I want is: 2023-08-01 12:00:00 I was able to get the result with:\r\n\r\n__This is fundamentally wrong__ - Instant and Timestamp simply do not work that way. This question is non-sensical. Your Timestamp represents 1690876800000. That&#39;s all it represents. Given that we&#39;re talking epoch millis, the only way it is sensible to say: I want it to represent [human reckoning values here], is if you include a full timezone (`Europe/Amsterdam` style, not `CEST` style, which aren&#39;t sufficient to uniquely determine times and dates).\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t have a timezone or that isn&#39;t what you&#39;re trying to represent, then `Timestamp` simply cannot be used AT ALL, and instead you need to use `LocalDateTime`, which is the only type that can properly represent human reckoning without a timezone!\r\n\r\nIf you want a nice programmatic interface to construction `java.sql.Timestamp` instances that represent what you want, use `java.time` and convert to the broken (`java.sql.Timestamp`, `java.util.Date`, etc) types _as late in the process as possible_:\r\n\r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt; Instant nowUtc = Instant.now();\r\n&gt; ZoneId europeZone = ZoneId.of(&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;);\r\n&gt; ZonedDateTime berlinTime = ZonedDateTime.ofInstant(nowUtc, europeZone);\r\n&gt; ```\r\n\r\nThis code can be written a lot more simply:\r\n\r\n```\r\nZoneId europeZone = ZoneId.of(&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;);\r\nZonedDateTime berlinTime = ZonedDateTime.now(europeZone);\r\n```\r\n\r\nConverting this to a `Timestamp` __does not make sense__ because j.s.Timestamp doesn&#39;t contain timezone info. If your database column __does__, then the only proper way to do it is to use `.setObject(colIdxOrName, instanceOfOffsetDateTime)`. Having to use OffsetDateTime is painful, but it&#39;s a consequence of SQL also being confused and broken in regards to timezones (it thinks offsets are timezones. They aren&#39;t, and calling them timezones is very confusing, but, here we are). You can try calling `.setObject()` with an instance of ZDT, but if that doesn&#39;t work, you&#39;d have to call:\r\n\r\n```\r\nZoneId europeZone = ZoneId.of(&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;);\r\nZonedDateTime berlinTime = ZonedDateTime.now(europeZone);\r\npreparedStatement.setObject(berlinTime.toOffsetDateTime());\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you must have it in Timestamp form, note that timezones are right out and this code __will__ subtly break on you later. Closest you can get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInstant now = Instant.now();\r\n// FORCIBLY SET YOUR SYSTEM TO BERLIN TIME!\r\n// STUFF WILL BREAK IF SYSTEM TZ IS EVER CHANGED!\r\njava.sql.Timestamp ts = java.sql.Timestamp.from(now);\r\n```\r\n\r\nj.s.Timestamp applies the platform local timezone whether you want it to or not.\r\n","title":"Timestamp#toInstant TimeZone behaviour","body":"<h2>Context</h2>\n<p><code>java.sql.Timestamp</code> extends <code>java.util.Date</code>.

As soon as I call `#toInstant()` on the `Timestamp` I&#39;m getting a datetime with 2 hours less. I think this is because Instant represents a point in time on UTC time scale.

Check out the official <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/text-blocks/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Programmer's Guide to Text Blocks</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>Now, prior to Java 13, this is how you'd write a query:</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;Tuple&gt;

I usually do not use autowiring in the java configuration classes. \r\n\r\n`@Configuration` annotated classes are beans by themselves so spring creates a bean that represents &#39;Test1&#39;... \r\n\r\nSo, following your example:\r\n~~~\r\n@Configuration\r\npublic class Test1 {\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    private Test3 test3;\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Configuration\r\npublic class Test2 {\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    private Test3 test3;\r\n\r\n    @Bean(name = &quot;test3 &quot;)\r\n    Test3 test3 () {\r\n        return new Test3(); \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll start with `Test2` bean. So you create a bean for `Test3`, fine, but then why do you autowire it as a data field on class `Test2`? I see only one possible reason for it: you have other beans that want to use this `Test3` bean. In this case you can do the following:\r\n\r\n**Option 1**\r\n~~~\r\n@Configuration\r\npublic class Test2 {\r\n\r\n  \r\n    @Bean(name = &quot;test3 &quot;)\r\n    Test3 test3 () {\r\n        return new Test3(); \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public SomeOtherBean someOtherBean() {\r\n       return new SomeOtherBean(test3()); \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public YetAnotherBean yetAnotherBean() {\r\n       return new YetAnotherBean(test3()); \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\nNote that `test3()` is called twice here, yet the same instance of `Test3` will be returned (because `Test3` is a singleton). This is one of those &#39;magical&#39; places in spring (technically it wraps the `@Configuration` annotated classes into smart proxies, but its beyond the scope of the question).\r\n\r\n**Option 2**\r\n~~~\r\n@Configuration\r\npublic class Test2 {\r\n\r\n  \r\n    @Bean(name = &quot;test3 &quot;)\r\n    Test3 test3 () {\r\n        return new Test3(); \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public SomeOtherBean someOtherBean(Test3 test3) {\r\n       return new SomeOtherBean(test3); \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public YetAnotherBean yetAnotherBean(Test3 test3) {\r\n       return new YetAnotherBean(test3); \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\nHere, note the dependency on these beans.\r\n\r\nNow, to continue with `Test1`: if you have another configuration file (`Test`) - again I assume you would like to inject this `Test3` bean somewhere into the beans defined in this `Test1` configuration class. Obviously the first aforementioned option is not available to you because it just won&#39;t compile, however you can easily use the second option. \r\n\r\nSo bottom line, in my personal opinion, you should not consider classes annotated with `@Configuration` as real classes, but rather a very restricted DSL (that happened to obey java syntax) that will allow bean definitions. So currently in my projects when I work with `@Configuration` classes I use @Autowired probably only in Tests. \r\n\r\n","title":"BeanCurrentlyInCreationException when @Autowired and @Bean are present in same class","body":"<p>I'm not sure what is the use case for such a configuration.

In this case you can do the following:</p>\n<p><strong>Option 1</strong></p>\n<pre><code>@Configuration\npublic class Test2 {\n\n  \n    @Bean(name = &quot;test3 &quot;)\n    Test3 test3 () {\n        return new Test3(); \n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    public SomeOtherBean someOtherBean() {\n       return new SomeOtherBean(test3()); \n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    public YetAnotherBean yetAnotherBean() {\n       return new YetAnotherBean(test3()); \n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that <code>test3()</code> is called twice here, yet the same instance of <code>Test3</code> will be returned (because <code>Test3</code> is a singleton). This is one of those 'magical' places in spring (technically it wraps the <code>@Configuration</code> annotated classes into smart proxies, but its beyond the scope of the question).</p>\n<p><strong>Option 2</strong></p>\n<pre><code>@Configuration\npublic class Test2 {\n\n  \n    @Bean(name = &quot;test3 &quot;)\n    Test3 test3 () {\n        return new Test3(); \n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    public SomeOtherBean someOtherBean(Test3 test3) {\n       return new SomeOtherBean(test3); \n    }\n\n    @Bean\n    public YetAnotherBean yetAnotherBean(Test3 test3) {\n       return new YetAnotherBean(test3); \n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, note the dependency on these beans.</p>\n<p>Now, to continue with <code>Test1</code>: if you have another configuration file (<code>Test</code>) - again I assume you would like to inject this <code>Test3</code> bean somewhere into the beans defined in this <code>Test1</code> configuration class. Obviously the first aforementioned option is not available to you because it just won't compile, however you can easily use the second option.</p>\n<p>So bottom line, in my personal opinion, you should not consider classes annotated with <code>@Configuration</code> as real classes, but rather a very restricted DSL (that happened to obey java syntax) that will allow bean definitions. So currently in my projects when I work with <code>@Configuration</code> classes I use @Autowired probably only in Tests.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":5795564,"reputation":698,"user_id":4571486,"accept_rate":31,"display_name":"chepaiytrath"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13185,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":7,"answer_count":2,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1692770675,"creation_date":1520415423,"question_id":49148529,"body_markdown":"    @Configuration\r\n    public class Test1 {\r\n    \r\n    \t@Autowired\r\n    \tprivate Test3 test3;\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    @Configuration\r\n    public class Test2 {\r\n    \r\n    \t@Autowired\r\n    \tprivate Test3 test3;\r\n    \r\n    \t@Bean(name = &quot;test3 &quot;)\r\n    \tTest3 test3 () {\r\n    \t\treturn new Test3();\t\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above code gives the following error.\r\n\r\n&gt;Caused by: \r\norg.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name &#39;test1&#39;: Injection of autowired dependencies failed; \r\nnested exception is \r\norg.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Could not autowire field: private Test3 com.package.name.Test1.test3;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n&gt;nested exception is \r\norg.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name &#39;test2&#39;: Injection of autowired dependencies failed; \r\nnested exception is \r\norg.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Could not autowire field: private Test3 com.package.name.Test2.test3;\r\n\r\n&gt;nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.**BeanCurrentlyInCreationException**: Error creating bean with name &#39;test3&#39;: Requested bean is currently in creation: Is there an unresolvable circular reference?\r\n\r\n\r\nHow is this an example of circular dependency?

didn&#39;t encounter any issues, but I do require information about it.\r\nWhile executing multiple test cases, it asks for an OTP. However, if I use a single session ID, it doesn&#39;t prompt for an OTP.Despite my lack of encountered issues, I find myself in need of further information on the subject. When engaged in the execution of multiple test cases, a notable phenomenon emerges: the system consistently prompts for the input of a One-Time Password (OTP), adding an additional layer of security to the process. However, intriguingly, a deviation from this pattern becomes apparent when a solitary session ID is employed.

However, if I use a single session ID, it doesn't prompt for an OTP.Despite my lack of encountered issues, I find myself in need of further information on the subject. When engaged in the execution of multiple test cases, a notable phenomenon emerges: the system consistently prompts for the input of a One-Time Password (OTP), adding an additional layer of security to the process. However, intriguingly, a deviation from this pattern becomes apparent when a solitary session ID is employed.

In Java when an Object is created and it is accessible via. reference. A reference refer to an Object. \r\n2. At a time one reference can refer to only one object\r\n3. A reference of type X can refer to an object of type X or any sub types (extending in case X is a class or implementing if X is an interface).\r\n\r\n\r\nNow Suppose there are two classes `Super` and `Sub` such that `Sub extends Super`. \r\n\r\n     SuperClass reference = new SubClass();  \r\n\r\nThis is allowed as SubClass inherits from SuperClass. \r\nAbove we have an object of type SubClass created in the heap and it is accessible via. reference named `reference`\r\n\r\nNote that a reference of type `SubClass` can not refer to object of `SuperClass`. Lets see in brief why so ?. If the reference of type `SubClass` was allowed to refer an Object of type `SuperClass` then it would have been allowed to invoke additional methods (functions) defined by `SubClass` (`SubClass` would have inherited all methods of `SuperClass` and would also have defined few additional methods). Now this would have made the application to crash as the Object of `SuperClass` only has methods defined in `SuperClass` but does not have any additional methods defined by `SubClass`. Hence compiler prevents it during compile time. Its a compile time error to have a reference of type `SubClass` referring to an object of type `SuperClass`\r\n\r\n Now lets look at the code as mentioned in the question\r\n\r\n     SuperClass a = new SuperClass();\r\n     SubClass b = new SubClass();\r\n     a = b; \r\n\r\nLine 1 : We have an object of SuperClass being referred by a variable of type SuperClass named `a`\r\n\r\nLine 2 : We have an object of SubClass being referred by a variable of type SubClass named `b`\r\n\r\nLine 3 : We have an assignment where `a` is assigned to refer the same object as referred by `b`. So now we have both references referring to the object of type `SubClass` created at line 2. Object of typer `SuperClass` created at line 1 (with the current available code mentioned in the question) is not having any references so it is eligible for garbage collection.\r\n","title":"What happens when a subclass object is assigned as a superclass object","body":"<p>It's simple assignment. <code>=</code> is an assignment operator. </p>\n\n<p>Lets be clear of below points.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>In Java when an Object is created and it is accessible via. reference. A reference refer to an Object. </li>\n<li>At a time one reference can refer to only one object</li>\n<li>A reference of type X can refer to an object of type X or any sub types (extending in case X is a class or implementing if X is an interface).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now Suppose there are two classes <code>Super</code> and <code>Sub</code> such that <code>Sub extends Super</code>. </p>\n\n<pre><code> SuperClass reference = new SubClass();  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is allowed as SubClass inherits from SuperClass. \nAbove we have an object of type SubClass created in the heap and it is accessible via. reference named <code>reference</code></p>\n\n<p>Note that a reference of type <code>SubClass</code> can not refer to object of <code>SuperClass</code>. Lets see in brief why so ?. If the reference of type <code>SubClass</code> was allowed to refer an Object of type <code>SuperClass</code> then it would have been allowed to invoke additional methods (functions) defined by <code>SubClass</code> (<code>SubClass</code> would have inherited all methods of <code>SuperClass</code> and would also have defined few additional methods). Now this would have made the application to crash as the Object of <code>SuperClass</code> only has methods defined in <code>SuperClass</code> but does not have any additional methods defined by <code>SubClass</code>. Hence compiler prevents it during compile time. Its a compile time error to have a reference of type <code>SubClass</code> referring to an object of type <code>SuperClass</code></p>\n\n<p>Now lets look at the code as mentioned in the question</p>\n\n<pre><code> SuperClass a = new SuperClass();\n SubClass b = new SubClass();\n a = b; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Line 1 : We have an object of SuperClass being referred by a variable of type SuperClass named <code>a</code></p>\n\n<p>Line 2 : We have an object of SubClass being referred by a variable of type SubClass named <code>b</code></p>\n\n<p>Line 3 : We have an assignment where <code>a</code> is assigned to refer the same object as referred by <code>b</code>. So now we have both references referring to the object of type <code>SubClass</code> created at line 2. Object of typer <code>SuperClass</code> created at line 1 (with the current available code mentioned in the question) is not having any references so it is eligible for garbage collection.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":20697151,"reputation":99,"user_id":15197127,"display_name":"Manav Sarkar"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1692762029,"creation_date":1692762029,"answer_id":76958106,"question_id":55436718,"body_markdown":"Lets play with inheritance, we have a class A and a class B. \r\n    \r\n    class A{\r\n        private int a;\r\n        A(int a){\r\n            this.a = a;\r\n        }\r\n        public int valA(){\r\n            return this.a;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    class B extends A{\r\n        B(int b) {\r\n            super(b);\r\n        }\r\n        public void printA(){\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;The Val of A: &quot;+valA());\r\n        }\r\n        public int valA(){return super.valA()*5;}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s special here that we have a method in B that is not defined in class A.
