I would also suggest to upgrade to Spring Boot 2.6 or even 2.7 instead of using an old unsupported version (both 1.2 and 2.2. aren&#39;t supported anymore). \r\n\r\n**NOTE:** your logging is a bit weird as you have both Log4j2 and Logback on your classpath, so I&#39;m not sure which you want to use. Spring Boot will default to Logback if found. \r\n","title":"SpringBoot Error java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: WebMvcAutoConfiguration$EnableWebMvcConfiguration.addDefaultHandlerExceptionResolvers(Ljava/util/List;)V","body":"<p>The problem is the list of dependencies and the incompatible versions you are using.</p>\n<p>You are using Spring Boot 1.2.3.RELEASE which requires Spring Framework 4.1.x (you included 5.2.x which is the source of your problems).

I would also suggest to upgrade to Spring Boot 2.6 or even 2.7 instead of using an old unsupported version (both 1.2 and 2.2. aren't supported anymore).</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> your logging is a bit weird as you have both Log4j2 and Logback on your classpath, so I'm not sure which you want to use. Spring Boot will default to Logback if found.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":25489463,"reputation":1,"user_id":19284522,"display_name":"couscous"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":534,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1654580742,"creation_date":1654556684,"question_id":72524290,"body_markdown":"I

Are there any pointers as to suggest what might be the potential cause for this?\r\n\r\nI observed that the CPU and memory utilisation of machines in prod is quite high.\r\n\r\nIf high CPU/Memory util is the cause for degradation, can you suggest ways to confirm that? Since this is prod environment, it would not be possible to attach a profiler to the application.\r\n\r\nI am very new to this, so any help would be appreciated!","title":"Degraded Java application performance in production","body":"<p>We have a Java application running in production.

Players[] is an array of boolean players. My logic is that its checked to see if they have went but it doesn't work really.\npIcon[] is an array of player characters (X,O,A,B,C...). I am not really sure how to fix this.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SINYS.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SINYS.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","android-layout","imageview"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":4129207,"reputation":75209,"user_id":3395198,"accept_rate":54,"display_name":"IntelliJ Amiya"},"score":0,"creation_date":1458295967,"post_id":36081603,"comment_id":59807603,"body_markdown":"`setVisibility(View.GONE);` working or same case ?","body":"<code>setVisibility(View.GONE);</code> working or same case ?"},{"owner":{"account_id":260152,"reputation":39795,"user_id":543539,"accept_rate":82,"display_name":"Egor"},"score":0,"creation_date":1458296003,"post_id":36081603,"comment_id":59807624,"body_markdown":"Is there any other code that makes this view visible?","body":"Is there any other code that makes this view visible?"},{"owner":{"account_id":5594584,"reputation":456,"user_id":4432725,"display_name":"Pratik"},"score":0,"creation_date":1458296074,"post_id":36081603,"comment_id":59807668,"body_markdown":"try this  findViewById(R.id.ivCompass).setVisibility(View.GONE);","body":"try this  findViewById(R.id.ivCompass).setVisibility(View.GONE);"},{"owner":{"account_id":7967476,"reputation":1326,"user_id":6013291,"accept_rate":81,"display_name":"Dennis van Opstal"},"score":0,"creation_date":1458296228,"post_id":36081603,"comment_id":59807775,"body_markdown":"setVisibility(View.GONE) doesn&#39;t work either","body":"setVisibility(View.GONE) doesn&#39;t work either"},{"owner":{"account_id":2713997,"reputation":1686,"user_id":2341757,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"LightYearsBehind"},"score":0,"creation_date":1458296276,"post_id":36081603,"comment_id":59807809,"body_markdown":"Please explain first why you think your ImageView is still visible?","body":"Please explain first why you think your ImageView is still visible?"},{"owner":{"account_id":7967476,"reputation":1326,"user_id":6013291,"accept_rate":81,"display_name":"Dennis van Opstal"},"score":0,"creation_date":1458296281,"post_id":36081603,"comment_id":59807812,"body_markdown":"@Egor as far as I know there isn&#39;t, if you want I can post the entire Activity though","body":"@Egor as far as I know there isn&#39;t, if you want I can post the entire Activity though"},{"owner":{"account_id":1672875,"reputation":9840,"user_id":1538986,"accept_rate":64,"display_name":"Opiatefuchs"},"score":0,"creation_date":1458296293,"post_id":36081603,"comment_id":59807824,"body_markdown":"GONE just kills the left space, while INVISIBLE let&#180;s  the space of the invisible view inside the layout.

The `fx:id` name is `calendar` but `@FXML` name is `datepicker`, they should be the same. \r\n     * I suggest `datePicker` to follow standard camel case naming\r\n    conventions.\r\n 3. You add a new event handler for the date picker action every time the action is triggered. Instead you should either:\r\n     * Add the action handler in the `initialize` method and NOT in FXML\r\n        OR\r\n     * Add the action handler in FXML and, in the code for `getHolidays`, only provide the code which implements the action handler (don’t call `setOnAction`, the FXML loader will do that for you).\r\n 4. You define the cell factory in the action handler.  You should not do that there, you should do that in the `initialize` method.\r\n\r\nThat is what I saw from quick review of what you provided.

\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>.</p>\n<pre><code>public class Main {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n     for (int i = -2; i &lt; 2; i++) { \n        try { \n           System.out.println(i+&quot; -&gt; &quot;+compute(i)); \n        \n        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {\n             System.out.println(i+&quot; -&gt; undefined&quot;)\n        }\n     }\n  }\n\n   \n private static int compute(int i) { \n      return 1/i;

You are creating two different objects here.\r\nYou will never get the `withdraw` value of `Account` in `Sav_acct` since both are different objects. Plus you are missing the basics of `Inheritence` in OOPS\r\n\r\nSince `Sav_acct` is extending the `Account` class it is inheriting all the properties of `Account`, so there is no need of creating an object of the `Account` class.\r\nInstead, create an object of `Sav_acct` and use this obj to perform your operations;\r\n```\r\nAccount wi = new Account();\r\nwi.withdrawl();\t\t\t\t\r\nSav_acct in = new Sav_acct();\r\nin.interest();\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\nSav_acct wi = new Sav_acct();\r\nwi.withdrawl();\r\nwi.interest();\r\n```\r\nYou need to know about how Inheritance works in OOPS. [Refer here][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n## The main problem ## \r\nYou are declaring objects multiple times whenever you needed.Eg:- \r\n```\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Enter your account type: Savings Account or Current Account&quot;);\r\nString t = sc.nextLine();\r\nif (&quot;Savings Account&quot;.equals(t)) {\r\n\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Do you want to deposit or withdraw amount?&quot;);\r\n\tString d = sc.nextLine();\r\n\tif (&quot;deposit&quot;.equals(d)) {\r\n\t\tAccount de = new Account();        // creating Account object  \r\n\t\tde.deposit();\r\n\t}\r\n\telse if (&quot;withdraw&quot;.equals(d)) {\r\n\t\tAccount wi = new Account();   // creating Account object  again\r\n\t\twi.withdrawl();\r\n\t\tSav_acct in = new Sav_acct();\r\n\t\tin.interest();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn the above why create `Account de = new Account();` separately for both `deposit` and `withdraw` just declare one object after getting the account type name and use it to perform respective jobs.\r\n```\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Enter your account type: Savings Account or Current Account&quot;);\r\nString t = sc.nextLine();\r\nif (&quot;Savings Account&quot;.equals(t)) {\r\n\r\n\tSav_acct acc = new Sav_acct(); //creating sav_acct object here and use \r\n\t\r\n\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Do you want to deposit or withdraw amount?&quot;);\r\n\tString d = sc.nextLine();\r\n\tif (&quot;deposit&quot;.equals(d)) {\r\n\t\t// Account de = new Account(); no need\r\n\t\tacc.deposit();\r\n\t}\r\n\telse if (&quot;withdraw&quot;.equals(d)) {\r\n\t\t//Account wi = new Account(); no need\r\n\t\tacc.withdrawl();\r\n\t\t//Sav_acct in = new Sav_acct(); no need again\r\n\t\tacc.interest();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nRedesign your code inside main method otherwise, most of the thing is fine\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.javatpoint.com/inheritance-in-java#:~:text=Inheritance%20in%20Java%20is%20a,are%20built%20upon%20existing%20classes.","title":"How Can I Use The Value Of A Variable In One Class To Another?","body":"<p>Don't use <code>public static</code> in a variable just to access it .
