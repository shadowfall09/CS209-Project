Nothing crazy, i attempted simple implementation which checks if Bearer token provided is not null.</p>\n<p>This is my SecurityConfig class:</p>\n<pre><code>@Configuration\n@EnableWebSecurity\n@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)\npublic class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint jwtAuthenticationEntryPoint;\n\n    @Autowired\n    private JwtRequestFilter jwtRequestFilter;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void configure(HttpSecurity httpSecurity) throws Exception {\n        httpSecurity.csrf().disable()\n            .authorizeRequests().antMatchers(&quot;/home&quot;).permitAll()\n            .anyRequest().authenticated().and()\n            .exceptionHandling()\n            .authenticationEntryPoint(jwtAuthenticationEntryPoint).and()\n            .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS);\n\n       httpSecurity.addFilterBefore(jwtRequestFilter, BasicAuthenticationFilter.class);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>This is my JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint class:</p>\n<pre><code>@Component\npublic class JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint implements AuthenticationEntryPoint, \nSerializable {\n\n    @Override\n    public void commence(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response,\n                     AuthenticationException authException) throws IOException {\n        String token = request.getHeader(&quot;Authorization&quot;);\n        if (token == null) {\n          response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED, &quot;Unauthorized&quot;);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And below is my Filter class:</p>\n<pre><code>@Component\npublic class JwtRequestFilter extends OncePerRequestFilter {\n\n    @Override\n    protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse \n                   response, FilterChain chain) throws ServletException, IOException {\n        chain.doFilter(request, response);\n    }\n}\n  \n</code></pre>\n<p>When i access the Rest API(through postman) providing a null token, it returns 401 UnAuthorized as expected. But when i access it by providing a valid Bearer token(not providing it here for security reasons), it returns 200 ok http status, but the response is null in the postman body(expected response is list of strings). What i am thinking is that the control is not going back to the Rest Controller API after the filter(httpSecurity.addFilterBefore) is processed in SecurityConfig. Is there a way to fix this? I changed POST to GET and i still see the problem.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","regex","regex-negation"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":195854,"reputation":159194,"user_id":438992,"accept_rate":90,"display_name":"Dave Newton"},"score":4,"creation_date":1324595693,"post_id":8610743,"comment_id":10686861,"body_markdown":"Couldn&#39;t you just match and negate whether or not it matched?

Could you please tell me why that&#39;s so and how I can fix it?**\r\n\r\nThe controller looks like this. As you see, there are no other attributes there that have the same name (&quot;user&quot;)\r\n```java\r\n    @GetMapping(&quot;/admin&quot;)\r\n    public String admin(Model model, Authentication authentication) {\r\n        model.addAttribute(&quot;users&quot;, service.getAllExceptLoggedUser(authentication))\r\n                .addAttribute(&quot;loggedUser&quot;, service.getLoggedUser(authentication))\r\n                .addAttribute(&quot;newUser&quot;, new User())\r\n                .addAttribute(&quot;adminRoleSet&quot;, service.getAdminRoleSet());\r\n        return &quot;admin&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAlso, the IDE doesn&#39;t underline &quot;user&quot; anywhere in my view code so it apparently knows what user I&#39;m talking about\r\n\r\nI read these StackOverflow questions: [1][1], [2][2], [3][3], [4][4]. They don&#39;t seem to have much to do with my question although they refer to the same error message\r\n\r\n**UPD:** For some reason, changing, for example, this\r\n```html\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; th:field=&quot;${user.id}&quot;&gt;\r\n```\r\nto this\r\n```html\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;id&quot; th:value=&quot;${user.id}&quot;&gt;\r\n```\r\nhelped. It seems so anyway, I haven&#39;t properly tested it yet. At least, I am now able to see the view, the modals pop up. Feel free to share your ideas on what that &quot;some&quot; reason might be in the comments (or even write a full-fledged answer)\r\n\r\nThough there&#39;s one but. I hoped a user&#39;s current department will be selected in the drop-down list. Instead, it&#39;s simply the first one\r\n```html\r\n&lt;fieldset&gt;\r\n     &lt;label for=&quot;departments&quot;&gt;Department: &lt;/label&gt;\r\n     &lt;select id=&quot;departments&quot; name=&quot;department&quot; th:value=&quot;${user.department}&quot;&gt;\r\n                  &lt;option th:value=&quot;accounting&quot;&gt;Accounting&lt;/option&gt;\r\n                  &lt;option th:value=&quot;sales&quot;&gt;Sales&lt;/option&gt;\r\n                  &lt;option th:value=&quot;&#39;information technology&#39;&quot;&gt;IT&lt;/option&gt;\r\n                  &lt;option th:value=&quot;&#39;human resources&#39;&quot;&gt;HR&lt;/option&gt;\r\n     &lt;/select&gt;\r\n&lt;/fieldset&gt;\r\n```\r\nThe salary is displayed fine, on the other hand\r\n```html\r\n&lt;fieldset&gt;\r\n      &lt;label for=&quot;salary&quot;&gt;Salary: &lt;/label&gt;\r\n      &lt;input id=&quot;salary&quot; name=&quot;salary&quot; th:value=&quot;${user.salary}&quot;/&gt;\r\n&lt;/fieldset&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8781558/neither-bindingresult-nor-plain-target-object-for-bean-name-available-as-request\r\n  [2]: https://ru.stackoverflow.com/questions/1301884/neither-bindingresult-nor-plain-target-object-for-bean-name-addto-available-as\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36375891/spring-4-neither-bindingresult-nor-plain-target-object\r\n  [4]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50928637/neither-bindingresult-nor-plain-target-object-for-bean-name-phonebook-availabl","title":"Thymeleaf can&#39;t access a list item&#39;s fields in my Bootstrap 4 project within the scope (&quot;Neither BindingResult nor plain target object...&quot;).

This guarantees compatibility between the type of fruitExecutor and fruit, resolving the error.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>private Map&lt;Class&lt;? extends AbstractFruit&gt;, AbstractFruitExecutor&lt;? extends AbstractFruit&gt;&gt; fruitExecutorMap;\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternate solution is to use Visitor Design pattern</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public interface FruitVisitor {\n    void visit(Apple apple);\n    void visit(Pear pear);\n    void visit(Orange orange);\n    // Add visit methods for other concrete subclasses of AbstractFruit as needed\n}\n\npublic abstract class AbstractFruit {\n    // ...\n    public abstract void accept(FruitVisitor visitor);\n}\n\npublic class Apple extends AbstractFruit {\n    // ...\n    @Override\n    public void accept(FruitVisitor visitor) {\n        visitor.visit(this);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Pear extends AbstractFruit {\n    // ...\n    @Override\n    public void accept(FruitVisitor visitor) {\n        visitor.visit(this);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Orange extends AbstractFruit {\n    // ...\n    @Override\n    public void accept(FruitVisitor visitor) {\n        visitor.visit(this);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class FruitProcessingContext {\n    // Define any context information needed for fruit processing\n}\n\n@Service\npublic class FruitExecutionDispatch implements FruitVisitor {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private FruitProcessingContext fpc;\n\n    public void executeAll(List&lt;AbstractFruit&gt; fruits) {\n        fruits.forEach(fruit -&gt; fruit.accept(this));\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void visit(Apple apple) {\n        // Logic for processing an apple goes here\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void visit(Pear pear) {\n        // Logic for processing a pear goes here\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void visit(Orange orange) {\n        // Logic for processing an orange goes here\n    }\n\n    // Implement additional visit methods for other concrete subclasses of AbstractFruit as needed\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":6802882,"reputation":175,"user_id":5235665,"display_name":"hotmeatballsoup"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":75941592,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1680710696,"creation_date":1680709032,"question_id":75941410,"body_markdown":"Java 11 and Spring Boot here (if that makes a difference).
