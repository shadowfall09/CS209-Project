Since I&#39;m writing my own authorization server (based upon docs like [here][2]) using the [`spring-security-oauth2-authorization-server`][3] module, I am also implementing a user management / admin dashboard.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the endpoints for the user management are on the auth server. So the auth server acts as authorization server and *(somewhat like a)* resource server. To authorize a user to use the admin dashboard, they will need to log-in of course, so first they are redirected to the auth servers `/authorize` endpoint which then redirects them to the login menu. The authorization code grant flow is then followed normally. But every step is being done on the same server *(i.e. authentication and accessing of the protected admin endpoints)*! \r\n\r\nI am struggeling to configure our auth server to act as an auth server **AND** resource server because of the following issues:\r\n\r\nThe authorization server saves the `securityContext` to the session. The session ID ([`JSESSIONID`][4]) is then left in the users browser as a cookie. The problem is that when the user tries to access a secured endpoint on the auth server such as the `{...}/admin/users` endpoint, the cookie alone is enough to authorize them to make a request to that endpoint. This means that the entire authorization flow can be circumvented, when a bearer token should be requested first to access the protected endpoint. We would like the secured endpoints to be accessible **ONLY** with a bearer token and just a bearer token, not a session *(or a combination of both)*.\r\n\r\nHere is a shortened version of the current security config:\r\n```java\r\n@Bean\r\n@Order(1)\r\npublic CorsFilter corsFilter(CorsConfigurationSource corsConfigurationSource) {\r\n    logger.info(&quot;Creating corsFilter bean&quot;);\r\n    return new CorsFilter(corsConfigurationSource);\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Configures the authorization server endpoints.\r\n */\r\n@Bean\r\n@Order(2)\r\npublic SecurityFilterChain authorizationServerSecurityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http, RegisteredClientRepository clientRepository) throws Exception {\r\n\r\n    OAuth2AuthorizationServerConfiguration.applyDefaultSecurity(http);\r\n\r\n    http.getConfigurer(OAuth2AuthorizationServerConfigurer.class)\r\n            .registeredClientRepository(clientRepository) // autowired from ClientConfig.java\r\n            .oidc(Customizer.withDefaults());\r\n\r\n    http.exceptionHandling((exceptions) -&gt; exceptions\r\n            .defaultAuthenticationEntryPointFor(\r\n                    new LoginUrlAuthenticationEntryPoint(&quot;/login&quot;),\r\n                    new MediaTypeRequestMatcher(MediaType.TEXT_HTML)\r\n            )\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    http.oauth2ResourceServer((resourceServer) -&gt; resourceServer\r\n            .jwt(Customizer.withDefaults()));\r\n\r\n    http.csrf(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable);\r\n\r\n    return http.build();\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Bean\r\n@Order(3)\r\npublic SecurityFilterChain defaultSecurityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\r\n    http.securityMatcher(new NegatedRequestMatcher(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/admin/**&quot;)));\r\n\r\n    http.authorizeHttpRequests((authorize) -&gt;\r\n            authorize\r\n                    .requestMatchers(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/register&quot;)).permitAll()\r\n                    .requestMatchers(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/recover&quot;)).permitAll()\r\n                    .requestMatchers(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/error/**&quot;)).permitAll()\r\n                    .requestMatchers(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/css/**&quot;)).permitAll()\r\n                    .requestMatchers(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/js/**&quot;)).permitAll()\r\n                    .requestMatchers(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/favicon.ico&quot;)).permitAll()\r\n                    .anyRequest().authenticated());\r\n\r\n    http.oauth2ResourceServer((resourceServer) -&gt; resourceServer\r\n            .jwt(Customizer.withDefaults()));\r\n\r\n    // set custom login form\r\n    http.formLogin(form -&gt; {\r\n        form.loginPage(&quot;/login&quot;);\r\n        form.permitAll();\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    http.logout(conf -&gt; {\r\n        // default logout url\r\n        conf.logoutSuccessHandler(logoutSuccessHandler());\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    http.csrf(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable);\r\n    http.cors(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable);\r\n\r\n    return http.build();\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Bean\r\n@Order(4)\r\npublic SecurityFilterChain adminResourceFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\r\n\r\n    // handle out custom endpoints in this filter chain\r\n    http.authorizeHttpRequests((authorize) -&gt;\r\n            authorize\r\n                    .requestMatchers(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/admin/**&quot;)).hasRole(&quot;ADMIN&quot;)\r\n                    .anyRequest().authenticated());\r\n\r\n    http.sessionManagement(conf -&gt; conf.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS));\r\n\r\n    http.oauth2ResourceServer((resourceServer) -&gt; resourceServer\r\n            .jwt(Customizer.withDefaults()));\r\n\r\n    http.csrf(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable);\r\n    http.cors(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable);\r\n\r\n    return http.build();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**How to configure the authorization server so the admin endpoints are secured independently from the security context from the session?**\r\n\r\nFor disclosure purposes, I was debugging *a lot* and tried basically the whole [basics][2]! I also tried a few other things: \r\n\r\nAccording to [Spring Security Documentation][5], it&#39;s possible to set the `.sessionManagement` to STATELESS in the security config. I had hoped that this would fix the issue, but setting this in the resource server filter chain showed to cause another issue: With the session management flag set to STATELESS, the  login isn’t processed properly. After the POST request from the login form, instead of redirecting to the “redirect_url” from the `/authorize` request, the auth server redirects to “/”…? *I think this is because the auth server module relies on the security context saved to the session for some of its filters.*\r\n\r\nI also had some issues with CORS and thought this might cause this.Considering that the [docs][6] say:\r\n\r\n&gt; CORS must be processed before Spring Security because the pre-flight request will not contain any cookies (i.e. the JSESSIONID). If the request does not contain any cookies and Spring Security is first, the request will determine the user is not authenticated (since there are no cookies in the request) and reject it.\r\n\r\nThis would explain that thefront-end Vue.js application doesn&#39;t work properly, but not the debugging calls via Postman. Now I deactivated CORS to not deal with those issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://spring.io/projects/spring-security\r\n  [2]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-authorization-server/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started.html\r\n  [3]: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.security/spring-security-oauth2-authorization-server/1.1.2\r\n  [4]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-session/docs/2.2.0.RELEASE/reference/html5/guides/java-custom-cookie.html\r\n  [5]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authentication/session-management.html\r\n  [6]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/reactive/integrations/cors.html","title":"How can I configure a Spring OAuth2 Auth Server to act both as an Auth and Resource Server, securing endpoints independently of session context?","body":"<p>I am currently working on an OAuth 2.0 login / user management system using <a href=\"https://spring.io/projects/spring-security\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Spring Security</a>.

To authorize a user to use the admin dashboard, they will need to log-in of course, so first they are redirected to the auth servers <code>/authorize</code> endpoint which then redirects them to the login menu. The authorization code grant flow is then followed normally. But every step is being done on the same server <em>(i.e. authentication and accessing of the protected admin endpoints)</em>!</p>\n<p>I am struggeling to configure our auth server to act as an auth server <strong>AND</strong> resource server because of the following issues:</p>\n<p>The authorization server saves the <code>securityContext</code> to the session. The session ID (<a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-session/docs/2.2.0.RELEASE/reference/html5/guides/java-custom-cookie.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>JSESSIONID</code></a>) is then left in the users browser as a cookie. The problem is that when the user tries to access a secured endpoint on the auth server such as the <code>{...}/admin/users</code> endpoint, the cookie alone is enough to authorize them to make a request to that endpoint. This means that the entire authorization flow can be circumvented, when a bearer token should be requested first to access the protected endpoint. We would like the secured endpoints to be accessible <strong>ONLY</strong> with a bearer token and just a bearer token, not a session <em>(or a combination of both)</em>.</p>\n<p>Here is a shortened version of the current security config:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Bean\n@Order(1)\npublic CorsFilter corsFilter(CorsConfigurationSource corsConfigurationSource) {\n    logger.info(&quot;Creating corsFilter bean&quot;);\n    return new CorsFilter(corsConfigurationSource);\n}\n\n\n/**\n * Configures the authorization server endpoints.\n */\n@Bean\n@Order(2)\npublic SecurityFilterChain authorizationServerSecurityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http, RegisteredClientRepository clientRepository) throws Exception {\n\n    OAuth2AuthorizationServerConfiguration.applyDefaultSecurity(http);\n\n    http.getConfigurer(OAuth2AuthorizationServerConfigurer.class)\n            .registeredClientRepository(clientRepository) // autowired from ClientConfig.java\n            .oidc(Customizer.withDefaults());\n\n    http.exceptionHandling((exceptions) -&gt; exceptions\n            .defaultAuthenticationEntryPointFor(\n                    new LoginUrlAuthenticationEntryPoint(&quot;/login&quot;),\n                    new MediaTypeRequestMatcher(MediaType.TEXT_HTML)\n            )\n    );\n\n    http.oauth2ResourceServer((resourceServer) -&gt; resourceServer\n            .jwt(Customizer.withDefaults()));\n\n    http.csrf(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable);\n\n    return http.build();\n}\n\n@Bean\n@Order(3)\npublic SecurityFilterChain defaultSecurityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\n    http.securityMatcher(new NegatedRequestMatcher(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/admin/**&quot;)));\n\n    http.authorizeHttpRequests((authorize) -&gt;\n            authorize\n                    .requestMatchers(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/register&quot;)).permitAll()\n                    .requestMatchers(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/recover&quot;)).permitAll()\n                    .requestMatchers(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/error/**&quot;)).permitAll()\n                    .requestMatchers(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/css/**&quot;)).permitAll()\n                    .requestMatchers(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/js/**&quot;)).permitAll()\n                    .requestMatchers(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/favicon.ico&quot;)).permitAll()\n                    .anyRequest().authenticated());\n\n    http.oauth2ResourceServer((resourceServer) -&gt; resourceServer\n            .jwt(Customizer.withDefaults()));\n\n    // set custom login form\n    http.formLogin(form -&gt; {\n        form.loginPage(&quot;/login&quot;);\n        form.permitAll();\n    });\n\n    http.logout(conf -&gt; {\n        // default logout url\n        conf.logoutSuccessHandler(logoutSuccessHandler());\n    });\n\n    http.csrf(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable);\n    http.cors(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable);\n\n    return http.build();\n}\n\n@Bean\n@Order(4)\npublic SecurityFilterChain adminResourceFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\n\n    // handle out custom endpoints in this filter chain\n    http.authorizeHttpRequests((authorize) -&gt;\n            authorize\n                    .requestMatchers(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/admin/**&quot;)).hasRole(&quot;ADMIN&quot;)\n                    .anyRequest().authenticated());\n\n    http.sessionManagement(conf -&gt; conf.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS));\n\n    http.oauth2ResourceServer((resourceServer) -&gt; resourceServer\n            .jwt(Customizer.withDefaults()));\n\n    http.csrf(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable);\n    http.cors(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable);\n\n    return http.build();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>How to configure the authorization server so the admin endpoints are secured independently from the security context from the session?</strong></p>\n<p>For disclosure purposes, I was debugging <em>a lot</em> and tried basically the whole <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-authorization-server/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">basics</a>! I also tried a few other things:</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authentication/session-management.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Spring Security Documentation</a>, it's possible to set the <code>.sessionManagement</code> to STATELESS in the security config. I had hoped that this would fix the issue, but setting this in the resource server filter chain showed to cause another issue: With the session management flag set to STATELESS, the  login isn’t processed properly. After the POST request from the login form, instead of redirecting to the “redirect_url” from the <code>/authorize</code> request, the auth server redirects to “/”…? <em>I think this is because the auth server module relies on the security context saved to the session for some of its filters.</em></p>\n<p>I also had some issues with CORS and thought this might cause this.Considering that the <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/reactive/integrations/cors.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">docs</a> say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CORS must be processed before Spring Security because the pre-flight request will not contain any cookies (i.e. the JSESSIONID). If the request does not contain any cookies and Spring Security is first, the request will determine the user is not authenticated (since there are no cookies in the request) and reject it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This would explain that thefront-end Vue.js application doesn't work properly, but not the debugging calls via Postman. Now I deactivated CORS to not deal with those issues.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","maven","import","jar"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":9293440,"reputation":1727,"user_id":6901184,"display_name":"Mart&#237;n Zaragoza"},"score":0,"creation_date":1534169567,"post_id":51823522,"comment_id":90602803,"body_markdown":"From your image I can infer that either you&#39;re refering to the classes using the wrong package declaration... or the Jar file is wrongly packaged.

You&#39;ll also lose social control because you don&#39;t know anymore what the user has actually filled in. You&#39;d as being a site admin really like to know which users/IPs are trying to perform XSS, so that you can easily track them and take actions accordingly. Escaping during request processing should only and only be used as latest resort when you really need to fix a train wreck of a badly developed legacy web application in the shortest time as possible. Still, you should ultimately rewrite your JSP files to become XSS-safe.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;d like to redisplay user-controlled input as HTML wherein you would like to allow only a specific subset of HTML tags like `&lt;b&gt;`, `&lt;i&gt;`, `&lt;u&gt;`, etc, then you need to sanitize the input by a whitelist. You can use a HTML parser like [Jsoup][6] for this. But, much better is to introduce a human friendly markup language such as Markdown (also used here on Stack Overflow). Then you can use a Markdown parser like [CommonMark][5] for this. It has also builtin HTML sanitizing capabilities. See also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3354669/markdown-or-html.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the term &quot;sanitizing&quot; such as Jsoup/Markdown/Owasp does concerns a very different thing than the term &quot;escaping&quot; such as `&lt;c:out&gt;` does. HTML sanitizers basically clean up a string containing possibly malicious HTML so that it can be used as safe HTML *without* the need to escape. I.e. when you actually intend to interpret user-controlled input literally as HTML, including tags like `&lt;div&gt;`, `&lt;p&gt;`, `&lt;img&gt;`, etc. HTML escapers basically prevent them to be interpreted at all, so that they show as plain text. In other words, you don&#39;t at all need to beforehand sanitize any HTML which you already are going to escape nonetheless.\r\n\r\nThe only concern in the server side with regard to databases is [SQL injection][7] prevention. You need to make sure that you never string-concatenate user-controlled input straight in the SQL or JPQL query and that you&#39;re using parameterized queries all the way. In JDBC terms, this means that you should use [`PreparedStatement`][8] instead of `Statement`.

I'm quite close but I struggle with the settings for line wrapping. As there is the option <code>NoLineWrap</code> from checkstyle the lines got cut nevertheless. Also, a look in the settings proves that the statements were ignored. As you can see in the screenshot there is still 'wrap if long' for many options although I added the following to the XML file:</p>\n<pre><code> &lt;module name=&quot;NoLineWrap&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;property name=&quot;tokens&quot;\n                      value=&quot;PACKAGE_DEF, IMPORT, STATIC_IMPORT, ENUM_DEF, CLASS_DEF , METHOD_DEF , INTERFACE_DEF, COMPACT_CTOR_DEF&quot;/&gt;\n &lt;/module&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/B6Xj9.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/B6Xj9.png\" alt=\"Settings IntelliJ own style sheet\" /></a></p>\n<p>Can somebody help me with my problem?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Edit:</em> My complete checkstyle.xml:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE module PUBLIC\n    &quot;-//Checkstyle//DTD Checkstyle Configuration 1.3//EN&quot;\n    &quot;https://checkstyle.org/dtds/configuration_1_3.dtd&quot;&gt;\n&lt;module name=&quot;Checker&quot;&gt;\n&lt;module name=&quot;SuppressWarningsFilter&quot;/&gt;\n\n&lt;property name=&quot;charset&quot;

in my project separately and run them together as well using testng.xml file.\nPreviously I used JUnit4 but needed to swap to the newer JUnit version to use <code>@ParameterizedTest</code> with <code>@CsvSourse</code>. And now, the JUnit test class executed successfully, but when I ran TestNG test class - it tried to be executed using org.apache.maven.surefire.junitplatform.JUnitPlatformProvider.</p>\n<p>To run test class I used this command:</p>\n<pre><code>mvn clean test -Dtest='src/test/java/tests/FiltersTest'\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>How I can fix the problem and make both runners work as expected?</strong></p>\n<p>P.S. I know that it's not the best approach to use two different runners inside the same project, but I need to do this according to the task from the Automation course I am taking part

Since I am a software developer working with several different versions for different clients I need to use multiple JDKs in my PC (Windows 10 Pro). So I do not want to change the system variables (i.e. `JAVA_HOME`, `JRE_HOME` or `PATH`), instead I use command prompt to run java in user process whenever I wanted to use a different version.\r\n\r\nWhen installing JDK it registers the `.jar` file association with latest version we installed in the PC.
