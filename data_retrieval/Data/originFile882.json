The first question should be, if you want a very generic solution, that will be able to store any XML document or one that is specific to your domain (i.e. only allows XML documents of a certain structure). Depending on that, you will have a very flexible, universal representation which is however harder to query (the SQL needed will be quite complicated). If you have a more specific approach, the queries will be simpler, but you will need to create new tables or add new attributes to existing talbes every time you want to store another type of document or add a field to an existing document; so changing the schema will be harder (which is one major advantage of XML).

Along with <code>~unsigned</code> methods in some of the the APIs, such as the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Integer.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Integer</code> API</a>, this makes it easy to do unsigned arithmetic.</p>\n<p>Even so, it might be convenient to have unsigned <code>class</code>es. Here is part of one for a 32-bit integer:</p>\n<pre><code> public final class Unsigned32BitInt implements      \n         Comparable&lt;Unsigned32BitInt&gt; {\n    \n    public static final Unsigned32BitInt ZERO = new \n         Unsigned32BitInt (0);\n    public static final Unsigned32BitInt ONE = new \n         Unsigned32BitInt (1);\n    \n    private final int value; // [2]\n    \n    public Unsigned32BitInt () { value = 0; }\n    public Unsigned32BitInt (long v) {  \n        value = (int) v ;       \n    }\n    public Unsigned32BitInt (int v) {\n        value = v;        \n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public int compareTo (Unsigned32BitInt  other) {\n        return Integer.compareUnsigned (this.value, other.value);\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public boolean equals (Object other) {\n        if (this == other) return true;\n        if (other == null) return false;\n        if ( ! (other instanceof Unsigned32BitInt )) return false;\n        return Integer.compareUnsigned \n           (this.value, ((Unsigned32BitInt) other).value) == 0;\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public int hashCode () { return value; }\n\n    public Unsigned32BitInt add (Unsigned32BitInt i) {  // [3]\n        return  new Unsigned32BitInt (i.value + this.value);      \n    }               \n            \n    public Unsigned32BitInt multiply (Unsigned32BitInt i) {\n        long a = i.value;\n        long b = value;\n        return new Unsigned32BitInt (a * b);\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public String toString () { \n        return Integer.toUnsignedString(value);\n    }\n }\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can continue, adding methods, including overriden methods and overloaded methods, to fit your needs.</p>\n<p>In some cases, as shown in <code>toString</code> and <code>compareTo</code> here, methods will be wrappers for methods in the <code>Byte</code>, <code>Short</code>, <code>Integer</code>, or <code>Long</code> APIs.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES:</strong></p>\n<p>[1] If you need arithmetic that can throw an <code>ArithmeticException</code> on overflow, there are <code>~Exact</code> methods in the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Math</code> API</a></p>\n<p>[2] I made Objects of type <code>Unsigned32BitInt</code> immutable. I kept the values as 32 bit integers.</p>\n<p>[3] My preference would be to have the arithmetic operations be instance methods, e.g. <code>c = a.add(b);</code>, <code>sum = sum.add(a);</code>. From your example, you might prefer <code>static</code> methods.

For the order arrival process, I want to generate orders. The due date of an order has to be either 18:00:00 PM, 19:00:00 PM, 20:00:00 PM or 21:00:00 PM. When an order is generated, its due date should be set, and should be randomly chosen from the 4 mentioned times. Each time/due date has the same probability of getting chosen. Does anyone know how I can do this?</p>\n<p>I used the following at <em>Action</em> of an <em>Event</em> for setting the due date of an order to 18:00:00 PM</p>\n<pre><code>`Order order = new Order();\n// Set due date as fixed time\nCalendar cal1 = Calendar.getInstance();\ncal1.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY,18);\ncal1.set(Calendar.MINUTE,00);\ncal1.set(Calendar.SECOND,0);\ncal1.set(Calendar.MILLISECOND,0);\norder.atrDueDate1 = cal1.getTime();\norder.atrID= 10;\norder.markParametersAreSet();\nenter.take(order);`\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, I do not want to fix the due date for all generated orders to 18:00:00 PM, but in the way I described before (chosen from the 4 times)</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","unit-testing","retrofit2","integration-testing"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2486870,"reputation":685,"user_id":2165146,"display_name":"muhammed ozbilici"},"score":0,"creation_date":1668547713,"post_id":74450120,"comment_id":131431345,"body_markdown":"check this example please : https://www.baeldung.com/spring-mock-rest-template","body":"check this example please : <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/spring-mock-rest-template\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">baeldung.com/spring-mock-rest-template</a>"}],"owner":{"account_id":26941965,"reputation":21,"user_id":20512623,"display_name":"Amin alvandi"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":811,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1668534684,"creation_date":1668534684,"question_id":74450120,"body_markdown":"I have a project written with java and spring boot.\r\nwhich I have in the program api call.\r\nFor this project, I need to write a test and I want to mock the response of api call.\r\nI use retrofit for third party api call.\r\nMy question is, how can I do this? \r\nI should write unit test or integration test? which on is correct? which on is the best practice?\r\n\r\n[This is how I make the retrofit.](https://i.stack.imgur.com/c6GFZ.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI used wired mock library but it didn&#39;t do what I wanted.","title":"Mock third party api call in test","body":"<p>I have a project written with java and spring boot.\nwhich I have in the program api call.\nFor this project, I need to write a test and I want to mock the response of api call.\nI use retrofit for third party api call.\nMy question is, how can I do this?\nI should write unit test or integration test? which on is correct? which on is the best practice?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/c6GFZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This is how I make the retrofit.</a></p>\n<p>I used wired mock library but it didn't do what I wanted.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2698782,"reputation":38625,"user_id":2330053,"display_name":"Idle_Mind"},"score":0,"creation_date":1668529775,"post_id":74449006,"comment_id":131425374,"body_markdown":"Be more specific.
