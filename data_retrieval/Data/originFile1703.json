Here&#39;s how I would go about it on a test:\r\n \r\n    public E findMaxQueueElement(Queue&lt;e&gt; queue) { //my test would ask me to return the max value\r\n        E max = queue.remove();\r\n        queue.add(max); //add it back to the end\r\n        for(int i=0; i&lt;queue.size()-1; i++) {\r\n            E current = queue.remove();\r\n            if (current.compareTo(max) &gt; 0) {\r\n                max = current;\r\n            }\r\n            queue.add(current);\r\n        }\r\n        return max;\r\n    }\r\nWith the limitations I provided, this should work. I hope this helps.","title":"Get max element in a Queue | Java","body":"<p>I'm taking a computer science class, and we aren't allowed to use the for each loop. I'm not sure if it's the same with you.

The trade-off between these two choices is a compute-time versus memory consumption trade-off. If you store the path to the image, the image will need to be loaded each time a cell updates (e.g. during scrolling), which takes time. On the other hand, if you store the `Image`, then all images needed for the entire table will need to be stored in memory, whether or not they are displayed.\r\n\r\nI would recommend storing the `Image` in the model class if your table only needs a small number of images. This may happen if the table only has a few rows, or if there are a small number of images and multiple rows show the same image. Note that `Image`s *can* be shared by multiple `ImageView`s, so there is no need to load any single `Image` more than once.\r\n\r\nUsing `Image` in the model class would look like this:\r\n\r\n    public class Apple {\r\n    \r\n        private String name;\r\n        private Image image;\r\n    \r\n        public Apple(String name, Image image) {\r\n            this.name = name;\r\n            this.image = image;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public String getName() {\r\n            return name;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void setName(String name) {\r\n            this.name = name;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public Image getImage() {\r\n            return image;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void setImage(Image image) {\r\n            this.image = image;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou will need a cell implementation to display the image:\r\n\r\n    public class ImageCell extends TableCell&lt;Apple, Image&gt;

whenever I select an option on the menu(say settings), it displays the contents of the option along with the bottom navigation view \r\n\r\nThat is because the BottomNavView is a part of the activity, and you need to move it to a fragment; this requires to change the navigation design of your app; to do that change your app navigation like the below:\r\n\r\nMain navigation:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;navigation\r\n ..... &gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;fragment\r\n        android:name=&quot;......HomeFragment&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;fragment\r\n        android:name=&quot;......SettingFragment&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;fragment\r\n        android:name=&quot;......AdsUpgradeFragment&quot;/&gt;\r\n\t\t\r\n    &lt;fragment\r\n        android:name=&quot;......PrivacyPolicyFragment&quot;/&gt;\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n&lt;/navigation&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `HomeFragment` is the fragment that should hold the `BottomNaviagtionView` instead of the activity; and when you navigate to the SettingFragment, the navConroller will replace the entire fragment in the navHostFragment, and therefore the `BottomNaviagtionView` won&#39;t be shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; my Activity&#39;s Toolbar contents which comprises of the nav hamburger\r\n&gt; icon, the edittext and the search button(the activity hosting my 3\r\n&gt; fragments) which spoils the app and makes it look very ugly\r\n\r\nUnlike the `BottomNaviagtionView`, you can&#39;t do that with your toolBar that is used as the supportActionBar, because setting `supportActionBar` more than once in order to change its look; will duplicates it; so you have to accept a single toolbar; but instead you can hide/show the layout that holds the search button &amp; the EditText whenever the destination changes:\r\n\r\n\tnavController.addOnDestinationChangedListener((controller, destination, arguments) -&gt; {\r\n\t\tLinearLayout searchBar = findViewById(R.id.searchbar); // change searchbar according to the layout id that holds the search button and the EditText\r\n\t\tif (destination.getId() == R.id.nav_home) {\r\n\t\t\tsearchBar.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);\r\n\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\tsearchBar.setVisibility(View.GONE);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n&gt; and yes they currently exit the app when clicking back \r\n\r\nTo exit the app whenever, the bottom back button is pressed in any fragment use `OnBackPressedDispatcher()` within `onCreateView()` of those fragment (in your case SettingFragment, PrivacyPolicyFragment, &amp; AdsUpgradeFragment):\r\n\r\nAnd make sure that `appBarConfiguration` doesn&#39;t reference those fragments so, that the UP button can be shown instead of the burger.\r\n```\r\nrequireActivity().getOnBackPressedDispatcher().addCallback(getViewLifecycleOwner(), new OnBackPressedCallback(true) {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void handleOnBackPressed() {\r\n            // Exit the app when back is pressed\r\n            if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP)\r\n                requireActivity().finishAndRemoveTask();\r\n            else requireActivity().finish();\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, make sure that your setup the `DrawerLayout` &amp; its `navView` in the `navController` with:\r\n\r\n    NavigationView navView = findViewById(....);\r\n\r\n    appBarConfiguration = new AppBarConfiguration.Builder(\r\n            R.id.nav_home) // remove up button from all these fragments &gt;&gt; Keep the up/back button in R.id.settings_id, R.id.settings_id, ads_upgrade_id, privacy_policy_id\r\n            .setOpenableLayout(drawer)\r\n            .build();\r\n\r\n    NavigationUI.setupActionBarWithNavController(this, navController, appBarConfiguration);\r\n    NavigationUI.setupWithNavController(navView, navController);\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd to make the Home fragment hidden by default in the navDrawer:\r\n\r\n    navView.getMenu().findItem(R.id.nav_home).setVisible(false); // adjust R.id.nav_home to yours\r\n\r\n## UPDATE\r\n&gt; I currently have a single nav graph. The firstFragment represents the\r\n&gt; today, 2nd - hourly and 3rd\r\n&gt;  I&#39;m using is for my other weather tabs but the one you&#39;re suggesting\r\n&gt; is for the navbar menu, should I replace yours with mine or just\r\n&gt; create a new one for your suggestion?\r\n\r\nYou should use two navGraphs, the first is for the main navigation which I&#39;d suggested; and the second is for the `BottomNavigationView` navigation which you already use; that is because we transferred the `BottomNavigationView` from the activity layout to the main/home fragment layout; and [it&#39; recommended the `BottomNavigationView` should have a separate navGraph][1];

And with <code>numbers.map(Optional::of)</code>, <code>E</code> is <code>Optional&lt;Number&gt;</code>, not <code>Optional&lt;? extends Number&gt;</code>, and <code>filter</code> carries that.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1262646,"reputation":2597,"user_id":1220560,"display_name":"morgwai"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":356,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":8,"accepted_answer_id":70433906,"answer_count":1,"score":8,"last_activity_date":1641560322,"creation_date":1640080550,"question_id":70433519,"body_markdown":"the below method compiles without problems:\r\n```java\r\nstatic Stream&lt;Optional&lt;? extends Number&gt;&gt; getNumbers(Stream&lt;Number&gt; numbers) {\r\n\treturn numbers.map(Optional::of);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nyet if I add a simple filtering to it like this:\r\n```java\r\nstatic Stream&lt;Optional&lt;? extends Number&gt;&gt; getNumbers2(Stream&lt;Number&gt; numbers) {\r\n\treturn numbers.map(Optional::of).filter(number -&gt; true);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nit generates the following error:\r\n&gt; incompatible types:  \r\njava.util.stream.Stream&lt;java.util.Optional&lt;java.lang.Number&gt;&gt; cannot be converted to  \r\njava.util.stream.Stream&lt;java.util.Optional&lt;? extends java.lang.Number&gt;&gt;\r\n\r\ntested on openJdk-11 and openJdk-17.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d expect them both to do the same (either both compile ok or both generate the same compilation error), so I&#39;m really puzzled by this: what is the general rule here that explains why the 1st method compiles ok yet the 2nd does not?\r\nThanks!","title":"filtering a stream changes its wildcard bounds?","body":"<p>the below method compiles without problems:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>static Stream&lt;Optional&lt;? extends Number&gt;&gt; getNumbers(Stream&lt;Number&gt; numbers) {\n    return numbers.map(Optional::of);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>yet if I add a simple filtering to it like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>static Stream&lt;Optional&lt;? extends Number&gt;&gt; getNumbers2(Stream&lt;Number&gt; numbers) {\n    return numbers.map(Optional::of).filter(number -&gt; true);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>it generates the following error:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>incompatible types:<br />\njava.util.stream.Stream&lt;java.util.Optional&lt;java.lang.Number&gt;&gt; cannot be converted to<br />\njava.util.stream.Stream&lt;java.util.Optional&lt;? extends java.lang.Number&gt;&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>tested on openJdk-11 and openJdk-17.</p>\n<p>I'd expect them both to do the same (either both compile ok or both generate the same compilation error), so I'm really puzzled by this: what is the general rule here that explains why the 1st method compiles ok yet the 2nd does not?\nThanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","file-io","checkmarx"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":446457,"reputation":5228,"user_id":839513,"accept_rate":57,"display_name":"baruchiro"},"score":0,"creation_date":1589727897,"post_id":61849794,"comment_id":109402234,"body_markdown":"Does this answer your question?

Perhaps you should post what you&#39;ve done with framebuffers so far, and I can try to help you draw it to screen without overdrawing everything else."},{"owner":{"account_id":1419645,"reputation":11379,"user_id":1344545,"accept_rate":59,"display_name":"mcfly soft"},"score":0,"creation_date":1640801309,"post_id":66611884,"comment_id":124663589,"body_markdown":"Great.

Also, why is <code>signature3</code> 72 bytes when the signature is only 71 bytes (although this is probably not critical)?"},{"owner":{"account_id":17563859,"reputation":35,"user_id":12741187,"display_name":"Wolfiwolf"},"score":0,"creation_date":1641743035,"post_id":70620505,"comment_id":124880202,"body_markdown":"I have checked that the same private key generates the same public key in both java and c++.
