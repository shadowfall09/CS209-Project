So the `build.sbt` looks like this\r\n\r\n```\r\nname := &quot;FindRetiredPeople&quot;\r\nversion := &quot;1.0&quot;\r\nscalaVersion := &quot;2.12.17&quot;\r\nfork := true\r\nlibraryDependencies ++= Seq(\r\n  &quot;org.apache.spark&quot; %% &quot;spark-core&quot; % &quot;3.3.2&quot;,\r\n  &quot;org.apache.spark&quot; %% &quot;spark-sql&quot; % &quot;3.3.2&quot;,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote when I `sbt assembly`, I am still using this (no `fork := true` and add `&quot;provided&quot;`):\r\n\r\n```\r\nname := &quot;FindRetiredPeople&quot;\r\nversion := &quot;1.0&quot;\r\nscalaVersion := &quot;2.12.17&quot;\r\nlibraryDependencies ++= Seq(\r\n  &quot;org.apache.spark&quot; %% &quot;spark-core&quot; % &quot;3.3.2&quot; % &quot;provided&quot;,\r\n  &quot;org.apache.spark&quot; %% &quot;spark-sql&quot; % &quot;3.3.2&quot; % &quot;provided&quot;\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote even after adding `fork := true`, it sitll only works in Java 11 and Java 1.8.\r\n\r\nSo now the log for `sbt run` looks like. It removed the harmless error in the UPDATE 1, but introduced some new harmless errors.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n➜ sbt run\r\n[info] welcome to sbt 1.8.2 (Amazon.com Inc.

With your source files and the compiler plugin both using the same encoding you shouldn't have any more unmappable characters during compilation.</p>\n\n<p>Note, You can also set the file encoding globally in eclipse through Window->Preferences->General->Workspace->Text File Encoding. You can also set the encoding per file type through Window->Preferences->General->Content Types.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":7808693,"reputation":1438,"user_id":5905678,"accept_rate":78,"display_name":"Khan"},"score":0,"creation_date":1547748196,"post_id":12000439,"comment_id":95307920,"body_markdown":"does it mean the special character was originating from windows?","body":"does it mean the special character was originating from windows?"},{"owner":{"account_id":327215,"reputation":2001,"user_id":649451,"display_name":"Venugopal Madathil"},"score":0,"creation_date":1547832739,"post_id":12000439,"comment_id":95341762,"body_markdown":"Looks like, yes.","body":"Looks like, yes."},{"owner":{"account_id":4912982,"reputation":14853,"user_id":3957754,"accept_rate":50,"display_name":"JRichardsz"},"score":0,"creation_date":1572102426,"post_id":12000439,"comment_id":103460575,"body_markdown":"Worked for me ;) : ubuntu 18.

For one, it&#39;s TERRIBLE coding practice just as it is in every other area of life to not clean up after yourself.  For another, you can&#39;t predict whether the operating system is going to recognize that the java environment no longer needs the resources and you could end up having locks on files/etc that can&#39;t be released without a forced restart.\r\n\r\nAlways clean up whatever resources you open!\r\n\r\nUpdate regarding your update to the original question - it takes 5 seconds to add a try/catch block to close any open resources, and can prevent you having to spend 5 minutes restarting your computer.

All configuration permutations I&#39;ve tried produce a &quot;Failed to connect to remote VM: Operation timed out&quot; error in the Eclipse remote debugger.\r\n\r\n**What I&#39;m using:**\r\n\r\nServer: Windows Server 2019 Datacenter in an AWS EC2 m5a.large instance\r\n\r\nRunning: Apache Tomcat 9.0.75 Server, Daemon 1.3.3.0, Oracle Java 1.8.0_291-b10\r\n\r\nClient: MacOS 12.6.3, Eclipse 2023-06\r\n\r\n\r\n**What I&#39;ve Tried:**\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve confirmed with `nmap` that the port I&#39;m shooting for (8085, as well as previous attempts using 8000) is open in Windows Firewall and unblocked by AWS security groups. Packets for port 8085 show in Windows Firewall logs and are not being dropped. Hopefully we can set that aside and assume the problem is my Tomcat/Eclipse config.\r\n\r\nIn the Daemon/GUI I currently have\r\n```\r\n-Xdebug\r\n-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8085,server=y,suspend=n\r\n```\r\nset under the **Java** tab **at the top** of the Java options box **before -D options**. The latter details are often stressed in other posts. I have also tried \r\n```\r\n-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8085,server=y,suspend=n\r\n```\r\nsince that is sometimes suggested for Java versions above 5 –&#160;no avail. I tried `.bat`-based approaches although I&#39;m pretty sure this is incompatible with a Tomcat service-based config e.g.:\r\n```\r\nset JPDA_OPTS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8085,server=y,suspend=n\r\n```\r\nin `setenv.bat` or `catalina.bat`. I&#39;d think one would want it to read `address=*:8085`, but this prevents Tomcat from starting. Logs provide nothing useful in this regard –&#160;`stdout initializing` and `exit code 0` or something to that effect.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve seen many mentions of setting CATALINA_OPTS/JPDA_OPTS/JPDA_ADDRESS/etc. but again, I don&#39;t believe this pertains to service configs. Nevertheless, I&#39;ve tried setting these in Windows Environment Variables and `setenv.bat` to no effect.\r\n\r\nI tried adding `jpda` before `start` in the &quot;Arguments&quot; box of the &quot;Startup&quot; tab, but that was more of a crapshoot than anything. Predictably, it didn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nIn Eclipse, I&#39;ve confirmed 10x that I have the correct host and port in my Remote Java Application debug config. I&#39;m using Socket Attach connection type and &quot;Source&quot; seems to contain the correct files.

All configuration permutations I've tried produce a &quot;Failed to connect to remote VM: Operation timed out&quot; error in the Eclipse remote debugger.</p>\n<p><strong>What I'm using:</strong></p>\n<p>Server: Windows Server 2019 Datacenter in an AWS EC2 m5a.large instance</p>\n<p>Running: Apache Tomcat 9.0.75 Server, Daemon 1.3.3.0, Oracle Java 1.8.0_291-b10</p>\n<p>Client: MacOS 12.6.3, Eclipse 2023-06</p>\n<p><strong>What I've Tried:</strong></p>\n<p>I've confirmed with <code>nmap</code> that the port I'm shooting for (8085, as well as previous attempts using 8000) is open in Windows Firewall and unblocked by AWS security groups. Packets for port 8085 show in Windows Firewall logs and are not being dropped. Hopefully we can set that aside and assume the problem is my Tomcat/Eclipse config.</p>\n<p>In the Daemon/GUI I currently have</p>\n<pre><code>-Xdebug\n-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8085,server=y,suspend=n\n</code></pre>\n<p>set under the <strong>Java</strong> tab <strong>at the top</strong> of the Java options box <strong>before -D options</strong>. The latter details are often stressed in other posts. I have also tried</p>\n<pre><code>-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8085,server=y,suspend=n\n</code></pre>\n<p>since that is sometimes suggested for Java versions above 5 – no avail. I tried <code>.bat</code>-based approaches although I'm pretty sure this is incompatible with a Tomcat service-based config e.g.:</p>\n<pre><code>set JPDA_OPTS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=8085,server=y,suspend=n\n</code></pre>\n<p>in <code>setenv.bat</code> or <code>catalina.bat</code>. I'd think one would want it to read <code>address=*:8085</code>, but this prevents Tomcat from starting. Logs provide nothing useful in this regard – <code>stdout initializing</code> and <code>exit code 0</code> or something to that effect.</p>\n<p>I've seen many mentions of setting CATALINA_OPTS/JPDA_OPTS/JPDA_ADDRESS/etc. but again, I don't believe this pertains to service configs. Nevertheless, I've tried setting these in Windows Environment Variables and <code>setenv.bat</code> to no effect.</p>\n<p>I tried adding <code>jpda</code> before <code>start</code> in the &quot;Arguments&quot; box of the &quot;Startup&quot; tab, but that was more of a crapshoot than anything. Predictably, it didn't work.</p>\n<p>In Eclipse, I've confirmed 10x that I have the correct host and port in my Remote Java Application debug config. I'm using Socket Attach connection type and &quot;Source&quot; seems to contain the correct files. The internal browser within Eclipse is connected to the internet, so I assume everything's playing nice with my proxy. I've also increased the Preferences -&gt; Java -&gt; Debug -&gt; debug &amp; launch timeouts to 600000 and 1200000ms, respectively.</p>\n<p>Of course, I've restarted the server, Eclipse, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>What I feel:</strong></p>\n<p>I'm at a complete loss here.

Or what do you think that could be a good way to go?\r\n\r\nThere is no absolute answer here. Context matters. \r\n\r\nAs noted in the Comments, generally it is best to keep arbitrary presentation separate from content (&quot;model&quot;). But not if the desired presentation text is intrinsic to the entity represented by the data model.\r\n\r\n - If the presentation details could reasonably vary for various reasons, then your data model (the three classes you showed us) should *not* generate that particular value. Presentation text should be generated by some other class, not your data model classes (`Collection`, `Serie`, `Card`). For example, in the *java.time* classes, see the `DateTimeFormatter` class that generates arbitrary or complex text on behalf of the date-time classes such as `LocalDate`.\r\n - If that particular presentation text (collection id + serie name + card id) is canonical or standardized as a formal/official structure, then your data model classes (`Collection`, `Serie`, `Card`) *should* generate that text. For example, the *java.time* classes have a `toString` class that generates text in standard [ISO 8601][1] format, as well as a [`getDisplayName`][2] method to generate formatted text. \r\n\r\nSo we cannot really answer your particular question, because we do not have an understanding of the domain from which you get your collection, serie, and card entities. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nBy the way, we can simplify that code. \r\n\r\nIf your classes are meant primarily to be transparent carriers of shallowly-immutable data, then use [`record`][3] in Java 16+. The constructor, getters, `hashCode` &amp; `equals`, and `toString` are all implicitly created by the compiler. \r\n\r\nIn Java 21+, you can use the more general interface `SequencedCollection` interface rather than `List`.

Or what do you think that could be a good way to go?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is no absolute answer here. Context matters.</p>\n<p>As noted in the Comments, generally it is best to keep arbitrary presentation separate from content (&quot;model&quot;). But not if the desired presentation text is intrinsic to the entity represented by the data model.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the presentation details could reasonably vary for various reasons, then your data model (the three classes you showed us) should <em>not</em> generate that particular value. Presentation text should be generated by some other class, not your data model classes (<code>Collection</code>, <code>Serie</code>, <code>Card</code>). For example, in the <em>java.time</em> classes, see the <code>DateTimeFormatter</code> class that generates arbitrary or complex text on behalf of the date-time classes such as <code>LocalDate</code>.</li>\n<li>If that particular presentation text (collection id + serie name + card id) is canonical or standardized as a formal/official structure, then your data model classes (<code>Collection</code>, <code>Serie</code>, <code>Card</code>) <em>should</em> generate that text. For example, the <em>java.time</em> classes have a <code>toString</code> class that generates text in standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ISO 8601</a> format, as well as a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/time/DayOfWeek.html#getDisplayName(java.time.format.TextStyle,java.util.Locale)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>getDisplayName</code></a> method to generate formatted text.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So we cannot really answer your particular question, because we do not have an understanding of the domain from which you get your collection, serie, and card entities.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>By the way, we can simplify that code.</p>\n<p>If your classes are meant primarily to be transparent carriers of shallowly-immutable data, then use <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/395\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>record</code></a> in Java 16+. The constructor, getters, <code>hashCode</code> &amp; <code>equals</code>, and <code>toString</code> are all implicitly created by the compiler.</p>\n<p>In Java 21+, you can use the more general interface <code>SequencedCollection</code> interface rather than <code>List</code>. See <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/431\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>JEP 431: Sequenced Collections</em></a>.</p>\n<p>As mentioned it Comments, <code>Collection</code> is the super-interface of the classes found in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_collections_framework\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Java Collections Framework</a>.

If it isn&#39;t, you&#39;ll have to write a quick little &#39;find index&#39; method, or alternatively (if `chars` is very large, as in, over 500 or so characters, __and__ isn&#39;t sorted, then looking through it every time is slow, __only then__ go for this alternative): Instead of building characters in a StringBuilder, build up an array containing indices, not values. Now there is no need to look up where in the `chars` array the digit &#39;b&#39; shows up.

Building your own parser for this data is almost trivial, though, so there&#39;s no reason to go through another project&#39;s code and try to extract what you need unless you plan on using their project as a whole.\r\n\r\nIf you want to start from the lower level\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Parsing**\r\n\r\nBuilding your own TIGER parser (reasonably easy - just a DB of line segments), and building a simple render on top of that (lines, polygons, letters/names) is also going to be fairly easy.  You&#39;ll want to look at various [map projection types][2] for the render phase.  The most frequently used (and therefore most familiar to users) is the [Mercator projection][3] - it&#39;s fairly simple and fast.  You might want to play with supporting other projections.\r\n\r\nThis will provide a bit of &#39;fun&#39; in terms of seeing how to project a map, and how to reverse that projection (say a user clicks on the map, you want to see the lat/lon they clicked - requires reversing the current projection equation).\r\n\r\n**Rendering**\r\n\r\nWhen I developed my renderer I decided to base my window on a fixed size (embedded device), and a fixed magnification.  This meant that I could center the map at a lat/lon, and with the center pixel=center lat/lon at a given magnification, and given the mercator projection I could calculate which pixel represented each lat/lon, and vice-versa.\r\n\r\nSome programs instead allow the window to vary, and instead of using magnification and a fixed point, they use two fixed points (often the upper left and lower right corners of a rectangle defining the window).  In this case it becomes trivial to determine the pixel to lat/lon transfer - it&#39;s just a few interpolation calculations.  Rotating and scaling make this transfer function a little more complex, but shouldn&#39;t be considerably so - it&#39;s still a rectangular window with interpolation, but the window corners don&#39;t need to be in any particular orientation with respect to north.  This adds a few corner cases (you can turn the map inside out and view it as if from inside the earth, for instance) but these aren&#39;t onerous, and can be dealt with as you work on it.\r\n\r\nOnce you&#39;ve got the lat/lon to pixel transfer done, rendering lines and polygons is fairly simple except for normal graphics issues (such as edges of lines or polygons overlapping inappropriately, anti-aliasing, etc).  But rendering a basic ugly map such as it done by many open source renderers is fairly straightforward.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll also be able to play with distance and great circle calculations - for instance a nice rule of thumb is that every degree of lat or lon at the equator is approximately 111.1KM - but one changes as you get closer to either pole, while the other continues to remain at 111.1kM.\r\n\r\n**Storage and Structures**\r\n\r\nHow you store and refer to the data, however, depends greatly on what you plan on doing with it.  A lot of difficult problems arise if you want to use the same database structure for demographics vs routing - a given data base structure and indexing will be fast for one, and slow for the other.\r\n\r\nUsing zipcodes and loading only the nearby zipcodes works for small map rendering projects, but if you need a route across the country you need a different structure.  Some implementations have &#39;overlay&#39; databases which only contain major roads and snaps routes to the overlay (or through multiple overlays - local, metro, county, state, country).  This results in fast, but sometimes inefficient routing.\r\n\r\n**Tiling**\r\n\r\nTiling your map is actually not easy.  At lower magnifications you can render a whole map and cut it up.  At higher magnifications you can&#39;t render the whole thing at once (due to memory/space constraints), so you have to slice it up.\r\n\r\nCutting lines at boundaries of tiles so you can render individual tiles results in less than perfect results - often what is done is lines are rendered beyond the tile boundary (or, at least the data of the line end is kept, though rendering stops once it finds it&#39;s fallen off the edge) - this reduces error that occurs with lines looking like they don&#39;t quite match as they travel across tiles.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll see what I&#39;m talking about as you work on this problem.\r\n\r\nIt isn&#39;t trivial to find the data that goes into a given tile as well - a line may have both ends outside a given tile, but travel across the tile.  You&#39;ll need to consult graphics books about this ([Michael Abrash&#39;s book is the seminal reference][4], freely available now at the preceding link).  While it talks mostly about gaming, the windowing, clipping, polygon edges, collision, etc all apply here.\r\n\r\nHowever, you might want to play at a higher level.\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOnce you have the above done (either by adapting an existing project, or doing the above yourself) you may want to play with other scenarios and algorithms.\r\n\r\n**Reverse geocoding is reasonably easy.**  Input lat/lon (or click on map) and get the nearest address.  This teaches you how to interpret addresses along line segments in TIGER data.\r\n\r\n**Basic geocoding is a hard problem.**  Writing an address parser is a useful and interesting project, and then converting that into lat/lon using the TIGER data is non-trivial, but a lot of fun.  Start out simple and small by requiring exact name and format matching, and then start to look into &#39;like&#39; matching and phonetic matching.  There&#39;s a lot of research in this area - look at search engine projects for some help here.\r\n\r\n**Finding the shortest path between two points is a non-trivial problem.**  There are many, many algorithms for doing that, most of which are patented.  I recommend that if you try this go with an easy algorithm of your own design, and then do some research and compare your design to the state of the art.  It&#39;s a lot of fun if you&#39;re into graph theory.\r\n\r\n**Following a path and pre-emptively giving instructions** is not as easy as it looks on first blush.  Given a set of instructions with an associated array of lat/lon pairs, &#39;follow&#39; the route using external input (GPS, or simulated GPS) and develop an algorithm that gives the user instructions as they approach each real intersection.  Notice that there are more lat/lon pairs than instructions due to curving roads, etc, and you&#39;ll need to detect direction of travel and so forth.  Lots of corner cases you won&#39;t see until you try to implement it.\r\n\r\n**Point of interest search.**  This one is interesting - you need to find the current location, and all the points of interest (not part of TIGER, make your own or get another source) within a certain distance (as the crow flies, or harder - driving distance) of the origin.  This one is interesting in that you have to convert the POI database into a format that is easy to search in this circumstance.  You can&#39;t take the time to go through millions of entries, do the distance calculation (sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), and return the results.  You need to have some method or algorithm to cut the amount of data down first.\r\n\r\n**Traveling salesman.**  Routing with multiple destinations.  Just a harder version of regular routing.\r\n\r\nYou can find a number of links to many projects and sources of information on this subject [here][5].\r\n\r\nGood luck, and please publish whatever you do, no matter how rudimentary or ugly, so others can benefit!\r\n\r\n-Adam\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tgrshp2008/tgrshp2008.html\r\n  [2]: http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/mapproj/mapproj_f.html\r\n  [3]: http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/mapproj/mapproj_f.html\r\n  [4]: https://www.jagregory.com/abrash-black-book/\r\n  [5]: http://delicious.com/stienman/gis","title":"What is the best way to read, represent and render map data?","body":"<p>First, I recommend that you use the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tgrshp2008/tgrshp2008.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2008 TIGER files</a>.</p>\n<p>Second, as others point out there are a lot of projects out there now that already read in, interpret, convert, and use the data.

Here&#39;s how I do it.**\r\n\r\nI gather whatever geometry I need in whatever formats they come in. I&#39;ve been pulling data from USGS, so that amounts to a bunch of:\r\n\r\n* SHP Files ([ESRI Shapefile Technical Description](http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf))\r\n* DBF Files ([Xbase Data file (*.dbf)](http://www.clicketyclick.dk/databases/xbase/format/dbf.html#DBF_STRUCT))\r\n\r\nI then wrote a program that &quot;compiles&quot; those shape definitions into a form that is efficient to render. This means doing any projections and data format conversions that are necessary to efficiently display the data. Some details:\r\n\r\n* For a 2D application, you can use whatever projection you want: [Map Projections](http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/mapproj/mapproj_f.html).\r\n* For 3D, you want to convert those latitude/longitudes into 3D coordinates. Here is some math on how to do that: [transformation from\r\nspherical coordinates to normal rectangular coordinates](http://www.mathforum.com/library/drmath/view/51711.html).\r\n* Break up all the primitives into a quadtree/octree (2D/3D). Leaf nodes in this tree contain references to all geometry that intersects that leaf node&#39;s (axis-aligned) bounding-box. (This means that a piece of geometry can be referenced more than once.)\r\n* The geometry is then split into a table of vertices and a table of drawing commands. This is an ideal format for OpenGL. Commands can be issued via [glDrawArrays](http://www.opengl.org/documentation/specs/man_pages/hardcopy/GL/html/gl/drawarrays.html) using vertex buffers ([Vertex Buffer Objects](http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glGenBuffers.xml)).\r\n* A general visitor pattern is used to walk the quadtree/octree. Walking involves testing whether the visitor intersects the given nodes of the tree until a leaf node is encountered. Visitors include: drawing, collision detection, and selection. (Because the tree leaves can contain duplicate references to geometry, the walker marks nodes as being visited and ignores them thereafter. These marks have to be reset or otherwise updated before doing the next walk.)\r\n* Using a spatial partitioning system (one of the trees) and a drawing-efficient representation is crucial to achieving high framerates. I have found that in these types of applications, you want your frame rate as high as possible 20 fps at a minimum. Not to mention the fact that lots of performance will give you lots of opportunities to create a better looking map. (Mine&#39;s far from good looking, but will get there some day.)\r\n* The spatial partitioning helps rendering performance by reducing the number of draw commands sent to the processor. However, there could come  a time when the user actually wants to view the entire dataset (perhaps an arial view). In this case, you need a level of detail control system. Since my application deals with streets, I give priority to highways and larger roads. My drawing code knows about how many primitives I can draw before my framerate goes down. The primitives are also sorted by this priority. I draw only the first `x` items where `x` is the number of primitives I can draw at my desired framerate.\r\n\r\nThe rest is camera control and animation of whatever data you want to display.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of my existing implementation:\r\n\r\n![Picture](http://seabusmap.com/assets/Picture%205.png) ![Picture](http://seabusmap.com/assets/Picture%207.png)\r\n\r\n","title":"What is the best way to read, represent and render map data?","body":"<p><strong>Funny question.

How do I make Bufferstrategy in the first code to continue and `show()` the black filled rectangle without putting it in a loop?\r\n\r\nThanks!","title":"Why Bufferstrategy flushes / won&#39;t show() when outside of rendering loop?","body":"<p>The following code will flush/clear the current buffer of the canvas ( a black screen will be displayed for a split second maybe and after that nothing will be displayed - which is not what I expected because I haven't stated for the buffer to be flushed )</p>\n<pre><code>public class Main {\n    static int width = 200;\n    static int height = 200 ;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args){\n        JFrame jframe = new JFrame();\n        Canvas canvas = new Canvas();\n        BufferStrategy bs;\n        Dimension dim = new Dimension(width,height);\n\n        canvas.setPreferredSize(dim);\n        jframe.setResizable(false);\n        jframe.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n        jframe.add(canvas);\n        jframe.pack();\n        jframe.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\n        jframe.setVisible(true);\n        canvas.requestFocus();\n\n        bs = canvas.getBufferStrategy();\n        if(bs == null){\n            canvas.createBufferStrategy(3);\n            bs = canvas.getBufferStrategy();\n        }\n        Graphics g = bs.getDrawGraphics();\n        g.setColor(Color.black);\n        g.fillRect(0,0,canvas.getWidth(),canvas.getHeight());\n        g.dispose();\n        bs.show();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, if the line of code <code>bs.show()</code> is changed into the following:</p>\n<pre><code>while(true){\n    bs.show();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then the screen will be filled with black color as wanted.</p>\n<p>Or even if we write ( I didn't add try-catch around <code>Thread.sleep()</code> for simplicity):</p>\n<pre><code>while(true){\n    Thread.sleep(1000);\n    bs.show();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then the window is filled with black as wanted.</p>\n<p>My questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the first code, why the window is flushed and the black filling of the window is not seen? does <code>show()</code> clear the current buffer?
