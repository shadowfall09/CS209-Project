Between the interactions with generics, the encapsulation of the data, and parallel processing of input, I have been pretty lost.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the code for the <code>HomeDataPoint</code> <code>insert()</code> method, an enum which holds the type of possible incoming <code>DataPoint</code> class objects, and the declaration of it's member variables:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private enum DataType\n            {\n                WEATHER_CLASS(WeatherDataPoint.class), \nELECTRIC_CLASS(ElectricDataPoint.class), GAS_CLASS(GasDataPoint.class);\n\n            private final Class&lt;? extends DataPoint&gt; type;\n\n            DataType(Class&lt;? extends DataPoint&gt; type)\n            {\n                this.type = type;\n            }\n\n            public Class&lt;? extends DataPoint&gt; getType()\n            {\n                return type;\n            }\n        }\n\n        private DataArrayList&lt;WeatherDataPoint&gt; weatherLowPoints = null;\n        private DataArrayList&lt;WeatherDataPoint&gt; weatherHighPoints = null;\n        private DataArrayList&lt;ElectricDataPoint&gt; electricPoints = null;\n        private DataArrayList&lt;GasDataPoint&gt; gasPoints = null;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the <code>insert()</code> method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public boolean insert(DataPoint dataElement)\n        {\n            if (totalSize() &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; !getDate().substring(0, 10).equals(dataElement.getDate().substring(0, 10)))\n            {\n                return false;\n            }\n            else if (totalSize() == 0)\n            {\n                setDate(dataElement.getDate());\n            }\n\n            for (DataType type : DataType.values())\n            {\n                if (type.getType().equals(dataElement.getClass()))\n                {\n                    switch (type)\n                    {\n                        case WEATHER_CLASS:\n                            weatherLowPoints.add((WeatherDataPoint) dataElement);\n                            weatherHighPoints.add((WeatherDataPoint) dataElement);\n                            return true;\n                        case ELECTRIC_CLASS:\n                            electricPoints.add((ElectricDataPoint) dataElement);\n                            return true;\n                        case GAS_CLASS:\n                            gasPoints.add((GasDataPoint) dataElement);\n                            return true;\n                        default:\n                            return false;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            return false;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","algorithm","sub-array"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":22990129,"reputation":1,"user_id":17115748,"display_name":"Payton Ratzliff"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1633811232,"creation_date":1633811232,"answer_id":69510339,"question_id":69509630,"body_markdown":"The first thing that I&#39;m noticing is that both of the questions you&#39;ve referenced are about finding the **count** of the subarrays with K unique elements, not **printing** them as you&#39;re trying to do here.

For each new valid subarray that the algorithm finds, it increases the total count of valid subarrays by 1 (for the new K-lengthed subarray) plus the length of the prefix. This is because each subarray that can be constructed from the prefix, when combined with the current sliding window, is still a subarray of K unique elements. This is how [1, 2, 1, 2] is counted in the algorithm - when i = 5, the &quot;sliding window&quot; is [1, 2] (the second occurrence of each number in the input list), and the prefix size is 2 - representing the list of [1, 2] (the first occurrence of each number in the input list). So, the total number of valid subarrays at this point in the algorithm is 3 - [1, 2] (the sliding window), [2, 1, 2] (the sliding window prepended with the last element of the prefix), and [1, 2, 1, 2] (the sliding window prepended with the entirety of the prefix).\r\n\r\nIf the window has more than K elements simply because each element is unique, then the algorithm knows that it&#39;s hit the end of a valid subarray - both the current window and any of the subarrays that prepend part of the prefix to it will always have more than K unique elements.

Since it is both error prone and a pain to maintain about 10 copies of this code I would like to abstract this.\r\n\r\nHere is what the code looks like for setting one property:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nif ( userConfigMapPath != null ) {\r\n    final TypeReference&lt;UserConfig&gt; ref =\r\n            new TypeReference&lt;UserConfig&gt;() {\r\n            };\r\n    this.userConfig = Optional.of(\r\n            new GenericConfigMap&lt;&gt;( userConfigMapPath, (int) REFRESH_RATE.getSeconds(), objectMapper, ref ) );\r\n} else {\r\n    this.userConfig = Optional.empty();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is repeated for each property, except with differing property names (in this case `userConfig`), path (`userConfigMapPath`) and type (`userConfigMap`).\r\n\r\nSo I try abstracting it into a method.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    private &lt;T&gt; Optional&lt;GenericConfigMap&lt;T&gt;&gt; optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath( final ObjectMapper objectMapper, final String path ) {\r\n        Optional&lt;GenericConfigMap&lt;T&gt;&gt; result;\r\n        if ( path != null ) {\r\n            final TypeReference&lt;T&gt; ref =\r\n                    new TypeReference&lt;T&gt;( ) {\r\n                    };\r\n            result = Optional.of(\r\n                    new GenericConfigMap&lt;&gt;( path, (int) REFRESH_RATE.getSeconds( ), objectMapper, ref ) );\r\n        } else {\r\n            result = Optional.empty( );\r\n        }\r\n        return result;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that since the type of each property is different this function is generic.  I use this method to set each property:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nthis.userConfig = optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath(objectMapper, userConfigMapPath);\r\nthis.networkConfig = optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath(objectMapper, networkConfigMapPath);\r\nthis.dodadConfig = optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath(objectMapper, dodadConfigMapPath);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow this *compiles* however it has some serious runtime issues.  The crux of the issue is that the compiler seems unable to determine what `T` is in any of the above cases.  It seems to base its selection of `T` based on the default of the object mapper instead of the type of the property.  And since the object mapper is reading from json this makes for a `LinkedHashMap` instead of any type we want.\r\n\r\nNow this doesn&#39;t cause a compile error, something that baffles me, but instead produces an exception any time we try to use a method from one of these properties we get a runtime type error (could not cast `LinkedHashMap` to the actual type).\r\n\r\nWhat I want is for the compiler to actually know at compile time the type of `T` for each call to the function. In fact I would be perfectly happy to tell it the type of `T` if it would let me.  Using this syntax that @JeroenSteenbeeke helped me with\r\n\r\n```java\r\nthis.userConfig = this.&lt;UserConfig&gt; optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath(objectMapper, userConfigMapPath);\r\nthis.networkConfig = this.&lt;NetworkConfig&gt; optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath(objectMapper, networkConfigMapPath);\r\nthis.doodadConfig = this.&lt;DoodadConfig&gt; optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath(objectMapper, doodadConfigMapPath);\r\n``` \r\nThis type information seems to have just been ignored since when I run the debugger it still behaves exactly as it did. So I tried some janky dependent typing using `Class` as a proxy:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    private &lt;T&gt; Optional&lt;GenericConfigMap&lt;T&gt;&gt; optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath( final Class&lt;T&gt;, final ObjectMapper objectMapper, final String path ) {\r\n        Optional&lt;GenericConfigMap&lt;T&gt;&gt; result;\r\n        if ( path != null ) {\r\n            final TypeReference&lt;T&gt; ref =\r\n                    new TypeReference&lt;T&gt;( ) {\r\n                    };\r\n            result = Optional.of(\r\n                    new GenericConfigMap&lt;&gt;( path, (int) REFRESH_RATE.getSeconds( ), objectMapper, ref ) );\r\n        } else {\r\n            result = Optional.empty( );\r\n        }\r\n        return result;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\nthis.userConfig = optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath( UserConfig.class, objectMapper, userConfigMapPath);\r\nthis.networkConfig = optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath( NetworkConfig.class, objectMapper, networkConfigMapPath);\r\nthis.doodadConfig = optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath( DoodadConfig.class, objectMapper, doodadConfigMapPath);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is basically the dependent function type:\r\n\r\n[![Dependent type][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThe compiler also ignores the type information given in this example and continues to produce the same incorrectly typed programs as before.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m really at my wits end with this.  ***Is there any way to get the compiler to recognize this type information and create values of the correct types?***\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/wJOmv.png","title":"Can I give a generic function the correct type information?","body":"<p>I have a bunch of class properties that are initialized in a somewhat complicated but very uniform way.

The crux of the issue is that the compiler seems unable to determine what <code>T</code> is in any of the above cases.  It seems to base its selection of <code>T</code> based on the default of the object mapper instead of the type of the property.  And since the object mapper is reading from json this makes for a <code>LinkedHashMap</code> instead of any type we want.</p>\n<p>Now this doesn't cause a compile error, something that baffles me, but instead produces an exception any time we try to use a method from one of these properties we get a runtime type error (could not cast <code>LinkedHashMap</code> to the actual type).</p>\n<p>What I want is for the compiler to actually know at compile time the type of <code>T</code> for each call to the function. In fact I would be perfectly happy to tell it the type of <code>T</code> if it would let me.  Using this syntax that @JeroenSteenbeeke helped me with</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>this.userConfig = this.&lt;UserConfig&gt; optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath(objectMapper, userConfigMapPath);\nthis.networkConfig = this.&lt;NetworkConfig&gt; optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath(objectMapper, networkConfigMapPath);\nthis.doodadConfig = this.&lt;DoodadConfig&gt; optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath(objectMapper, doodadConfigMapPath);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This type information seems to have just been ignored since when I run the debugger it still behaves exactly as it did. So I tried some janky dependent typing using <code>Class</code> as a proxy:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>    private &lt;T&gt; Optional&lt;GenericConfigMap&lt;T&gt;&gt; optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath( final Class&lt;T&gt;, final ObjectMapper objectMapper, final String path ) {\n        Optional&lt;GenericConfigMap&lt;T&gt;&gt; result;\n        if ( path != null ) {\n            final TypeReference&lt;T&gt; ref =\n                    new TypeReference&lt;T&gt;( ) {\n                    };\n            result = Optional.of(\n                    new GenericConfigMap&lt;&gt;( path, (int) REFRESH_RATE.getSeconds( ), objectMapper, ref ) );\n        } else {\n            result = Optional.empty( );\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>this.userConfig = optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath( UserConfig.class, objectMapper, userConfigMapPath);\nthis.networkConfig = optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath( NetworkConfig.class, objectMapper, networkConfigMapPath);\nthis.doodadConfig = optionalGenericConfigMapFromPath( DoodadConfig.class, objectMapper, doodadConfigMapPath);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is basically the dependent function type:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wJOmv.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wJOmv.png\" alt=\"Dependent type\" /></a></p>\n<p>The compiler also ignores the type information given in this example and continues to produce the same incorrectly typed programs as before.</p>\n<p>I'm really at my wits end with this.  <em><strong>Is there any way to get the compiler to recognize this type information and create values of the correct types?</strong></em></p>\n"},{"tags":["java","python","jython"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":12173479,"reputation":90,"user_id":8887330,"display_name":"Ravindra Prajapati"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1633810834,"creation_date":1621337518,"answer_id":67585330,"question_id":67563505,"body_markdown":"Download requests-2.25.1.tar.gz from the [official repo](https://pypi.org/project/requests/#files), then go to that directory in terminal,\r\nand type the following command:\r\n```\r\njava -jar &lt;path-to-jython-standalone-2.7.2.jar&gt; setup.py install\r\n```\r\nThis will install requests in jython.

It wirked, but now I am facing runtime problem.</p>\n<p>This is the result shown by the autograder. <br>\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/j07jh.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/j07jh.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":22124137,"reputation":3297,"user_id":16376827,"display_name":"g00se"},"score":0,"creation_date":1633791122,"post_id":69507706,"comment_id":122857001,"body_markdown":"Have a look at `BreakIterator`","body":"Have a look at <code>BreakIterator</code>"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":22924636,"reputation":3,"user_id":17059932,"display_name":"Alya Vie"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1633794772,"creation_date":1633794772,"answer_id":69508348,"question_id":69507706,"body_markdown":"So, I&#39;m not exactly sure of what you want to do because the way you displayed the wanted output is not readable, and you did not give us the content of the file to display.\r\nBut if I understood well, if you have the following array : \r\n\r\n{&quot;Hello world&quot;}, {&quot;Have a good day&quot;} \r\n\r\nwhat you want to display should be :\r\n- Word : Hello, Line number : 0, Word number 0\r\n- Word : world,  Line number : 0, Word number 1\r\n- Word : Have, Line number : 1, Word number 0\r\n- Word : a, Line number : 1, Word number 1\r\n- Word : good, Line number : 1, Word number 2\r\n- Word : day, Line number : 1, Word number 3\r\n\r\nSo, to begin with there is an easy way to read all lines of a file into an Array List :\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n     * Read a file and put all its content into a String List\r\n     * @param fileName file path\r\n     * @return\r\n     */\r\n    public static ArrayList&lt;String&gt; readFileInList(String fileName){\r\n        List&lt;String&gt; lines = Collections.emptyList();\r\n        try {\r\n            lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(fileName), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\r\n        } catch (IOException e) {\r\n            // do something\r\n            e.printStackTrace();\r\n        }\r\n        return (ArrayList&lt;String&gt;) lines;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nNext is the way you do your loop...\r\n```\r\nfor (String item: list) {\r\n            //System.out.println(item);\r\n\r\n            while (lineNum &lt;= (list.size() - 1)) {\r\n\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Line Number: &quot; + lineNum + &quot; &quot; + &quot;line reads: &quot; + &quot; &quot; + list.get(lineNum));\r\n                //  System.out.println(list.size());\r\n                lineNum++;\r\n                charNum++;\r\n\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nWhat you do is essentially imbricating 2 loops that go through the same items.

The rest of the API is so over-engineered but there doesn't seem to be a handy method for retrieving the original source code.</p>\n\n<p>The real problem is that then the compiler gets spontaneously upset by the second source file in the output directory (\"error: duplicate class\") and now I'm stuck.</p>\n\n<p>I've already written the rest of this -- a macro lexer and parser and whatnot for calculating some data and inserting the field values and methods -- but it operates as a initial step outside the compiler. Except for the fact that the original files cannot have a .java extension (to prevent the compiler seeing them), this works nicely. Then I heard that annotations can do code generation, which I assume will be more proper and convenient, but I can't find much guidance on it.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","windows","spring-boot","intellij-idea","openjdk-17"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":8362430,"reputation":856,"user_id":6280255,"display_name":"Just another Java programmer"},"score":0,"creation_date":1633615713,"post_id":69482459,"comment_id":122811704,"body_markdown":"It&#39;s just a warning that these options will be removed in the future.","body":"It&#39;s just a warning that these options will be removed in the future."},{"owner":{"account_id":47283,"reputation":703817,"user_id":139985,"accept_rate":69,"display_name":"Stephen C"},"score":0,"creation_date":1633616198,"post_id":69482459,"comment_id":122811939,"body_markdown":"If you are seeing those messages, you are NOT running your application using OpenJDK 11 ... as the question tag implies.
