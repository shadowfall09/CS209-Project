As above but instead of providing the `File` object, provide its path to `fromFile(Path path)` after you&#39;ve written to it&#39;s `FileOutputStream`\r\n 5. Convert the `InputSteam` to a `Publisher&lt;ByteArray&gt;` using [`DataBufferUtils.readByteChannel`][11] from the Spring Framework, Akka [`StreamConverters`][12] etc. and then use `fromPublisher`\r\n 6.
