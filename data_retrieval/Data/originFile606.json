Since some calls to these routines are dynamically generated they are associated with the bootstrap loader.  This means the replacement classes must also be loaded by the bootstrap loader for class/name resolution to work."},{"owner":{"account_id":7323154,"reputation":101,"user_id":5578476,"display_name":"Mark Roberts"},"score":0,"creation_date":1558971837,"post_id":56300738,"comment_id":99265455,"body_markdown":"We want to verify that the replacement methods exist before the testing starts so we look down each component of the boot class path to see if a matching class exists.

A VerticleTask might look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass VerticleTask extends JavaExec {\r\n\r\n   @Input\r\n   String name\r\n\r\n   @Input\r\n   List&lt;String&gt; verticleArgs = []\r\n\r\n   @TaskAction\r\n   @Override\r\n   public void exec() {\r\n      mainClass = &quot;com.main.VerticleLauncher&quot;\r\n      classpath = project.sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath\r\n      args = [name, &quot;run&quot;, verticleArgs ].flatten()\r\n      super.exec()\r\n   }\r\n}","title":"Gradle task to run another task with multiple arguments","body":"<p>So it might look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>task launchVerticles {\n   List&lt;String&gt; verticles = [&quot;verticle1&quot;, &quot;verticle2&quot;, &quot;verticle3&quot;]\n   doLast {\n      verticles.parrallelStream().forEach( { verticle -&gt;\n         new JavaExec().with {\n            mainClass = &quot;com.main.VerticleLauncher&quot;\n            classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath\n            args = [verticle, &quot;run&quot;, verticleRunCommands.getOrDefault(cmdargs, &quot;&quot;) ]\n            exec()\n         }\n      } as Consumer&lt;String&gt;)\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So tasks aren't functions.

Mutation testing requires a green suite.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The 9 tests mentioned are the only tests that use static mocking with Mockito.</p>\n<p>The tests generally look like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Sample Static Mocking Test</strong></p>\n<pre><code>@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)\npublic class SampleTest {\n\n    @Test\n    public void sampleTestWithMocking() {\n        String param = &quot;test&quot;;\n        String expected = &quot;value&quot;;\n\n        MockedStatic&lt;MyClass&gt; mockStaticMyClass = Mockito.mockStatic(MyClass.class);\n        mockStaticMyClass.when(() -&gt; MyClass.myStaticMethod(param)).thenReturn(expected);\n\n        assertEquals(expected, MyClass.myStaticMethod(param));\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","image","swing","awt"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":969721,"reputation":344527,"user_id":992484,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"MadProgrammer"},"score":0,"creation_date":1677791378,"post_id":75620826,"comment_id":133412495,"body_markdown":"The `MouseEvent` will give you relative coordinates to the component that the listener is attached to, so, in your context, `0x0` will actally be the top/left position of the label","body":"The <code>MouseEvent</code> will give you relative coordinates to the component that the listener is attached to, so, in your context, <code>0x0</code> will actally be the top/left position of the label"},{"owner":{"account_id":27379464,"reputation":21,"user_id":20884266,"display_name":"Risk&#233;"},"score":0,"creation_date":1677791599,"post_id":75620826,"comment_id":133412560,"body_markdown":"@MadProgrammer the problem is that when I click on the top left of the image, I have as coordinates 0x~250","body":"@MadProgrammer the problem is that when I click on the top left of the image, I have as coordinates 0x~250"},{"owner":{"account_id":969721,"reputation":344527,"user_id":992484,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"MadProgrammer"},"score":0,"creation_date":1677791750,"post_id":75620826,"comment_id":133412598,"body_markdown":"Well, based on your code, it should be working and it works when I run your code, so you&#39;re probably adding the `MouseListener` to the wrong component","body":"Well, based on your code, it should be working and it works when I run your code, so you&#39;re probably adding the <code>MouseListener</code> to the wrong component"},{"owner":{"account_id":27379464,"reputation":21,"user_id":20884266,"display_name":"Risk&#233;"},"score":0,"creation_date":1677791824,"post_id":75620826,"comment_id":133412621,"body_markdown":"@MadProgrammer i want 0x0 not 0x250 when I point to the top left of the image","body":"@MadProgrammer i want 0x0 not 0x250 when I point to the top left of the image"},{"owner":{"account_id":27379464,"reputation":21,"user_id":20884266,"display_name":"Risk&#233;"},"score":0,"creation_date":1677791894,"post_id":75620826,"comment_id":133412635,"body_markdown":"@MadProgrammer maximize the window and try again","body":"@MadProgrammer maximize the window and try again"},{"owner":{"account_id":969721,"reputation":344527,"user_id":992484,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"MadProgrammer"},"score":1,"creation_date":1677791924,"post_id":75620826,"comment_id":133412643,"body_markdown":"I know what you want, and I&#39;m telling you, based on the code you&#39;ve provided, `0x0` WILL be the top left of label position - how ever, it may not be the top/left of the icon, as the icon may be draw in a different position within the context of the label - to be honest, this is not the approach I would take to solve this problem","body":"I know what you want, and I&#39;m telling you, based on the code you&#39;ve provided, <code>0x0</code> WILL be the top left of label position - how ever, it may not be the top/left of the icon, as the icon may be draw in a different position within the context of the label - to be honest, this is not the approach I would take to solve this problem"},{"owner":{"account_id":969721,"reputation":344527,"user_id":992484,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"MadProgrammer"},"score":1,"creation_date":1677791984,"post_id":75620826,"comment_id":133412664,"body_markdown":"*&quot;maximize the window and try again&quot;* - It won&#39;t make any difference, the `MouseListener` will ALWAYS report the mouse coordinates within the context of the component","body":"<i>&quot;maximize the window and try again&quot;</i> - It won&#39;t make any difference, the <code>MouseListener</code> will ALWAYS report the mouse coordinates within the context of the component"},{"owner":{"account_id":27379464,"reputation":21,"user_id":20884266,"display_name":"Risk&#233;"},"score":0,"creation_date":1677792043,"post_id":75620826,"comment_id":133412681,"body_markdown":"@MadProgrammer you&#39;re right !
