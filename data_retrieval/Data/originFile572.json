Alice wants to wait, but, instead of the &#39;condition for when you can cease waiting&#39; being: &quot;After X milliseconds have passed&quot;, the condition we want to wait for is &quot;When event Z happens, and Z is something another thread (Bob, in our case), will witness and will want to tell us about&quot;.\r\n\r\nTo get the job done, __first__, we need Alice and Bob to both have a reference to _the same object_. Generally, because threading and locking is quite tricky, this should be __non-global__ - i.e. something alice and bob have, but the rest of the wider code base doesn&#39;t. Failure to adhere to this rule makes it almost impossible to reason about code because you&#39;ll have no idea who is capable of messing with that &#39;lock&#39; object. For the same reason you should replace public fields with private ones and if needed access methods (setters and getters), __do not have public locks__. Unfortunately, `synchronized` defaults to `this` if you stick it on a method, so, never do that unless you really, really know what you are doing. Instead, make private lock objects.\r\n\r\nThen, here&#39;s the flow:\r\n\r\n1. Alice __LOCKS__ on the lock. (`synchronized (lock) { ... }).\r\n2. Whilst holding it (inside the braces that go with the block), alice runs into the situation where alice wants to wait until event Z happens. She calls `lock.wait()` on the lock. This will both freeze the Alice thread as well as release the lock.\r\n3. Bob locks on the exact same lock object. This will cause bob to wait (he didn&#39;t call `lock.wait`, he tried to entered a synchronized block which can also cause waiting to occur) until Alice either exits her synchronized block _or_ invokes `wait` on the lock.\r\n4. Bob does some stuff and eventually wants to wake Alice up, so bob calls `lock.notifyAll()` (I generally advise not calling notify - the difference is mostly esoteric and usually irrelevant, though). Bob can only do this when he holds the lock (inside a `synchronized (lock) {}` block).\r\n5. This __does not actually wake Alice up!__ - after all, for alice to wake up, alice has to re-acquire the lock (that `lock.wait()` call is inside `synchronized (lock) {}` after all, and bob holds that lock right now; has to be, because Bob can&#39;t call `lock.notifyAll()` unless bob holds that lock!). It merely sets alice up to wake when bob&#39;s done with their lock.\r\n\r\nAnd.. that&#39;s all there is to it.\r\n\r\nThis isn&#39;t necessarily the best way to do locking; often something from the `java.util.concurrent` package is a better idea.\r\n\r\nThe problem in your code is that you just call `wait()`, which therefore resolves to `this.wait()`, but you wanted `lock.wait()`.","title":"Why does thread wait(milis) halt scheduled executor?","body":"<p>You're not using <code>wait</code> correctly.</p>\n<p>Here's a very short manual to wait/notify (these 2 methods go hand in hand, there is zero point using one of them without also using the other!)</p>\n<p>We have 2 threads, we shall name them Alice and Bob.

This will cause bob to wait (he didn't call <code>lock.wait</code>, he tried to entered a synchronized block which can also cause waiting to occur) until Alice either exits her synchronized block <em>or</em> invokes <code>wait</code> on the lock.</li>\n<li>Bob does some stuff and eventually wants to wake Alice up, so bob calls <code>lock.notifyAll()</code> (I generally advise not calling notify - the difference is mostly esoteric and usually irrelevant, though). Bob can only do this when he holds the lock (inside a <code>synchronized (lock) {}</code> block).</li>\n<li>This <strong>does not actually wake Alice up!</strong> - after all, for alice to wake up, alice has to re-acquire the lock (that <code>lock.wait()</code> call is inside <code>synchronized (lock) {}</code> after all, and bob holds that lock right now; has to be, because Bob can't call <code>lock.notifyAll()</code> unless bob holds that lock!). It merely sets alice up to wake when bob's done with their lock.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And.. that's all there is to it.</p>\n<p>This isn't necessarily the best way to do locking; often something from the <code>java.util.concurrent</code> package is a better idea.</p>\n<p>The problem in your code is that you just call <code>wait()</code>, which therefore resolves to <code>this.wait()</code>, but you wanted <code>lock.wait()</code>.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":28030946,"reputation":41,"user_id":21410131,"display_name":"PleaseHlep123"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":115,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":75754750,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1678963373,"creation_date":1678959115,"question_id":75754287,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to wrap my head around threads and I&#39;ve thought of this particular case:\r\nA scheduled runnable which will poll data from somewhere and when there is no data to poll the thread should wait for a while and then start polling again.\r\n\r\nThis is an example code of what I was trying to accomplish\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class ThreadTest {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Object lock = new Object();\r\n        ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutorService = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(10);\r\n        ScheduledFuture&lt;?&gt; scheduledFuture = scheduledExecutorService.scheduleWithFixedDelay(new Worker(lock), 100, 1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\r\n\r\n        while(!scheduledFuture.isDone()) {\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Main finished&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static class Worker implements Runnable {\r\n\r\n        private final Object lock;\r\n        public Worker(Object lock) {\r\n            this.lock = lock;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void run() {\r\n            long startMilis = 0;\r\n            try {\r\n                synchronized (lock) {\r\n                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + &quot; Simulating work by sleeping for 3 seconds&quot;);\r\n                    Thread.sleep(3000);\r\n                    startMilis = System.currentTimeMillis();\r\n                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + &quot; Work done.

In my personal experience when you have to stub a private method for testing, then that method has nothing to do in that class. A common pattern, in that case, would be to *wrap* it within an interface, like `Callable` and then you pass in that interface also in the constructor (with that multiple constructor trick):\r\n\r\n    public ClassToTest() {\r\n        this(...);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public ClassToTest(final Callable&lt;T&gt; privateMethodLogic) {\r\n        this.privateMethodLogic = privateMethodLogic;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMostly all that I wrote looks like it&#39;s a [dependency injection][1] pattern. In my personal experience it&#39;s really useful while testing, and I think that this kind of code is cleaner and will be easier to maintain. I&#39;d say the same about nested classes. If a nested class contains heavy logic it would be better if you&#39;d moved it as a package private class and have injected it into a class needing it.\r\n\r\nThere are also several other design patterns which I have used while refactoring and maintaining legacy code, but it all depends on cases of your code to test. Using reflection mostly is not a problem, but when you have an enterprise application which is heavily tested and tests are run before every deployment everything gets really slow (it&#39;s just annoying and I don&#39;t like that kind of stuff).\r\n\r\nThere is also setter injection, but I wouldn&#39;t recommended using it. I&#39;d better stick with a constructor and initialize everything when it&#39;s really necessary, leaving the possibility for injecting necessary dependencies.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection\r\n","title":"How do I test a class that has private methods, fields or inner classes?","body":"<p>I would suggest you refactoring your code a little bit.

If a nested class contains heavy logic it would be better if you'd moved it as a package private class and have injected it into a class needing it.</p>\n<p>There are also several other design patterns which I have used while refactoring and maintaining legacy code, but it all depends on cases of your code to test. Using reflection mostly is not a problem, but when you have an enterprise application which is heavily tested and tests are run before every deployment everything gets really slow (it's just annoying and I don't like that kind of stuff).</p>\n<p>There is also setter injection, but I wouldn't recommended using it. I'd better stick with a constructor and initialize everything when it's really necessary, leaving the possibility for injecting necessary dependencies.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":10300420,"reputation":300,"user_id":7599315,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"Rahul"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1669386714,"creation_date":1504892218,"answer_id":46121866,"question_id":34571,"body_markdown":"You can use [PowerMockito][1] to set return values for private fields and private methods that are called/used in the private method you want to test:\r\n\r\nFor example, setting a return value for a private method:\r\n\r\n    MyClient classUnderTest = PowerMockito.spy(new MyClient());\r\n\r\n    // Set the expected return value\r\n    PowerMockito.doReturn(20).when(classUnderTest, &quot;myPrivateMethod&quot;, anyString(), anyInt());\r\n    // This is very important.

So if I am only trying to cover all the cases through the &quot;computeNextGeneration&quot; method and after refactoring, some tests are red, it is probably time consuming to identify the place where the bug is.</p>\n<p>If I am testing &quot;determineCellState&quot; and &quot;countNeighbors&quot; separately and after refactoring and optimization, tests of &quot;computeNextGeneration&quot; and &quot;determineCellState&quot; are red, I am pretty sure that the error will be in the &quot;determineCellState&quot; method.</p>\n<p>Also, if you write unit tests for those methods from the beginning, this tests will help you to develop the methods / the algorithms without a need to considering and wrapping other method calls and cases inside the public method. You can just write fast small tests covering your cases in the method ... for example if the test with the name &quot;countNeighbors_should_return_right_amount_of_neighbors_for_the_right_top_corner_cell()&quot; fails, then it is pretty clear where to look for the bug.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":167824,"reputation":21098,"user_id":1439305,"accept_rate":81,"display_name":"Audrius Meškauskas"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1678957086,"creation_date":1678957086,"answer_id":75753914,"question_id":34571,"body_markdown":"Define implementation class where the reason of public methods to be public is that they implement the clearly defined functionality, rather than if they are accessed from the outside of the class or not.

For example, my request payload looks like this,</p>\n<pre><code>{\n &quot;type&quot; : &quot;basic&quot;,\n &quot;method&quot; : &quot;someMethod&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I want to add a label within that metric as, <code>http_server_requests_seconds_bucket{exception=&quot;None&quot;,method=&quot;POST&quot;,outcome=&quot;SUCCESS&quot;,status=&quot;200&quot;,uri=&quot;/pos/authenticate&quot;,le=&quot;0.268435456&quot;,     challenge=&quot;basic&quot;}</code> which is based on the request payload &quot;type&quot; parameter. Can someone please help with this</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> We only allow limited number of values for &quot;type&quot;</p>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":4101523,"reputation":1355,"user_id":3366932,"accept_rate":57,"display_name":"Araymer"},"score":5,"creation_date":1478919326,"post_id":40559107,"comment_id":68355666,"body_markdown":"Put

For spans of time unattached to the timeline, the [standard format][2] is `PnYnMnDTnHnMnS`. The `P` marks the beginning, and the `T` separates the years-month-days from the hours-minutes-seconds. So an hour and a half is `PT1H30M`. \r\n\r\nThe java.time classes use ISO 8601 formats by default for parsing and generating strings. The [`Duration`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html) and [`Period`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Period.html) classes use this particular standard format.

If anyone has already built something similar please contact me!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI have a simple script `my-script.py` that does some calculations very fast using a specific library written in `Python`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport sys\r\nimport special-library\r\n\r\ndef fun(x):\r\n  do something\r\n\r\nfun(sys.argv[1])\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my `Java` code, I use/call this script a lot in different part of the code, using the `ProcessBuilder` approach, which means that I simply run the command `python my-script.py argument`.\r\nThis means that every time I call this script, I have to execute the `import` commands which is the most **time-consuming** thing in this (the calculation part is actually faster).\r\n\r\nIs there a solution **so that I call the import just once**? I looked a little bit about `Jython` - would be possible to write a class or something that would be initiated and do the import once and then calling a function of it every time I want to do the calculations part (`fun`)?

I created the [`BatchingOptimisticLockingTest`](https://github.com/vladmihalcea/high-performance-java-persistence/blob/515dae44a4b34891705074c94e51e8dfb9faa330/core/src/test/java/com/vladmihalcea/book/hpjp/hibernate/batch/BatchingOptimisticLockingTest.java) in my High-Performance Java Persistence GitHub repository to demonstrate how the new behavior works.\r\n\r\nFirst, we will define a `Post` entity that defines a `@Version` property, therefore enabling [the implicit optimistic locking mechanism](https://vladmihalcea.com/optimistic-locking-version-property-jpa-hibernate/):\r\n\r\n    @Entity(name = &quot;Post&quot;)\r\n    @Table(name = &quot;post&quot;)\r\n    public class Post {\r\n    \r\n    \t@Id\r\n    \t@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)\r\n    \tprivate Long id;\r\n    \r\n    \tprivate String title;\r\n    \r\n    \t@Version\r\n    \tprivate short version;\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic Long getId() {\r\n    \t\treturn id;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic Post setId(Long id) {\r\n    \t\tthis.id = id;\r\n    \t\treturn this;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic String getTitle() {\r\n    \t\treturn title;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic Post setTitle(String title) {\r\n    \t\tthis.title = title;\r\n    \t\treturn this;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic short getVersion() {\r\n    \t\treturn version;\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWe will enable the JDBC batching using the following 3 configuration properties:\r\n\r\n    properties.put(&quot;hibernate.jdbc.batch_size&quot;, &quot;5&quot;);\r\n    properties.put(&quot;hibernate.order_inserts&quot;, &quot;true&quot;);\r\n    properties.put(&quot;hibernate.order_updates&quot;, &quot;true&quot;);\r\n\r\nWe are going to create 3 `Post` entities:\r\n\r\n    doInJPA(entityManager -&gt; {\r\n    \tfor (int i = 1; i &lt;= 3; i++) {\r\n    \t\tentityManager.persist(\r\n    \t\t\tnew Post()\r\n    \t\t\t\t.setTitle(String.format(&quot;Post no. %d&quot;, i))\r\n    \t\t);\r\n    \t}\r\n    });\r\n\r\nAnd Hibernate will execute a JDBC batch insert:\r\n\r\n    SELECT nextval (&#39;hibernate_sequence&#39;)\r\n    SELECT nextval (&#39;hibernate_sequence&#39;)\r\n    SELECT nextval (&#39;hibernate_sequence&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    Query: [\r\n    \tINSERT INTO post (title, version, id) \r\n    \tVALUES (?, ?, ?)\r\n    ], \r\n    Params:[\r\n    \t(Post no. 1, 0, 1), \r\n    \t(Post no. 2, 0, 2), \r\n    \t(Post no. 3, 0, 3)\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nSo, we know that JDBC batching works just fine.\r\n\r\nNow, let&#39;s replicate the optimistic locking issue:\r\n\r\n    doInJPA(entityManager -&gt; {\r\n    \tList&lt;Post&gt; posts = entityManager.createQuery(&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    \t\tselect p \r\n    \t\tfrom Post p\r\n    \t\t&quot;&quot;&quot;, Post.class)\r\n    \t.getResultList();\r\n    \r\n    \tposts.forEach(\r\n    \t\tpost -&gt; post.setTitle(\r\n    \t\t\tpost.getTitle() + &quot; - 2nd edition&quot;\r\n    \t\t)\r\n    \t);\r\n    \r\n    \texecuteSync(\r\n    \t\t() -&gt; doInJPA(_entityManager -&gt; {\r\n    \t\t\tPost post = _entityManager.createQuery(&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    \t\t\t\tselect p \r\n    \t\t\t\tfrom Post p\r\n    \t\t\t\torder by p.id\r\n    \t\t\t\t&quot;&quot;&quot;, Post.class)\r\n    \t\t\t.setMaxResults(1)\r\n    \t\t\t.getSingleResult();\r\n    \r\n    \t\t\tpost.setTitle(post.getTitle() + &quot;
