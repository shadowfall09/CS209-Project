For Java 7 and later, you should switch to using *try-with-resources* ... as described in other answers.\r\n\r\nIf you are trying to catch and report all exceptions at source (in Java 6 or earlier), a better solution is this:\r\n\r\n    ObjectOutputStream oos = null;\r\n    try {\r\n       oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(file));\r\n       oos.writeObject(shapes);\r\n       oos.flush();\r\n    } catch (FileNotFoundException ex) {\r\n        // complain to user\r\n    } catch (IOException ex) {\r\n        // notify user\r\n    } finally {\r\n        if (oos != null) {\r\n            try {\r\n                oos.close();\r\n            } catch (IOException ex) {\r\n                // ignore ... any significant errors should already have been\r\n                // reported via an IOException from the final flush.\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n  - The standard Java wrapper streams, readers and writers all propagate `close` and `flush` to their wrapped streams, etc.  So you only need to close or flush the outermost wrapper.\r\n  - The purpose of flushing explicitly at the end of the try block is so that the (real) handler for `IOException` gets to see any write failures&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.\r\n  - When you do a close or flush on an output stream, there is a &quot;once in a blue moon&quot; chance that an exception will be thrown due to disc errors or file system full.  *You should not squash this exception!*.\r\n\r\nIf you often have to &quot;close a possibly null stream ignoring IOExceptions&quot;, then you could write yourself a helper method like this:\r\n\r\n    public void closeQuietly(Closeable closeable) {\r\n        if (closeable != null) {\r\n            try {\r\n                closeable.close();\r\n            } catch (IOException ex) {\r\n                // ignore\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nthen you can replace the previous finally block with:\r\n\r\n    } finally {\r\n        closeQuietly(oos);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnother answer points out that a `closeQuietly` method is already available in an Apache Commons library ... if you don&#39;t mind adding a dependency to your project for a 10 line method.  \r\n\r\nBut be careful that you only use `closeQuietly` on streams where IO exceptions *really* are irrelevant.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE** : `closeQuietly` is deprecated in version 2.6 of the Apache Commons API.  Java 7+ *try-with-resources* makes it redundant.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nOn the issue of `flush()` versus `close()` that people were asking about in comments:\r\n\r\n  - The standard &quot;filter&quot; and &quot;buffered&quot; output streams and writers have an API contract that states that `close()` causes all buffered output to be flushed.

Short described; it is about gathering different information from the phone, like light sensor, motion sensor, sound, location or even user behavior etc. and depending on your app requirement and the gathered information:\r\n\r\n - You could send these information over cloud data store for statically usage\r\n - You could make your phone doing (behavior) different things depending on location, motion or what ever.\r\n - etc.\r\n\r\nFor context awareness it is an open area for pervasive computing research. And it is not just few lines of code to write, it is typically a complete solution depending on requirement.

The ArcModel class is another plain Java object that holds a slice.\r\n\r\n\tpublic class ArcModel {\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate final int closureType;\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate final double startingAngle;\r\n\t\tprivate final double extent;\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate Color color;\r\n\t\tprivate final Color originalColor;\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate final Rectangle rectangle;\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic ArcModel(Color color, Rectangle rectangle, double startingAngle,\r\n\t\t\t\tdouble extent, int closureType) {\r\n\t\t\tthis.color = color;\r\n\t\t\tthis.originalColor = color;\r\n\t\t\tthis.rectangle = rectangle;\r\n\t\t\tthis.startingAngle = startingAngle;\r\n\t\t\tthis.extent = extent;\r\n\t\t\tthis.closureType = closureType;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic int getClosureType() {\r\n\t\t\treturn closureType;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic double getStartingAngle() {\r\n\t\t\treturn startingAngle;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic double getExtent() {\r\n\t\t\treturn extent;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic Rectangle getRectangle() {\r\n\t\t\treturn rectangle;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic Color getColor() {\r\n\t\t\treturn color;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic void brighterColor() {\r\n\t\t\tthis.color = Color.WHITE;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic void darkerColor() {\r\n\t\t\tthis.color = originalColor;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nIn addition to the getters and setters, we have a method to brighten the color and a method to darken the color.  I&#39;ve set the bright color to white to make it more easily visible.\r\n\r\nNow that we&#39;ve created the model classes, let&#39;s look at the view classes.  The first view class is the DrawingPanel class.\r\n\r\n\tpublic class DrawingPanel extends JPanel {\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate static final long serialVersionUID = 70146219705119575L;\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate List&lt;ArcModel&gt; segments;\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic DrawingPanel() {\r\n\t\t\tthis.segments = new ArrayList&lt;ArcModel&gt;();\r\n\r\n\t\t\tint margin = 50;\r\n\t\t\tint diameter = 300;\r\n\t\t\tRectangle r = new Rectangle(margin, margin, diameter, diameter);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tsegments.add(new ArcModel(Color.GREEN, r, 180, 90, Arc2D.PIE));\r\n\t\t\tsegments.add(new ArcModel(Color.BLUE, r, 270, 90, Arc2D.PIE));\r\n\t\t\tsegments.add(new ArcModel(Color.RED, r, 360, 90, Arc2D.PIE));\r\n\t\t\tsegments.add(new ArcModel(Color.YELLOW, r, 90, 90, Arc2D.PIE));\r\n\r\n\t\t\tint width = diameter + margin + margin;\r\n\t\t\tthis.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(width, width));\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic void brighterArcModelColor(int index) {\r\n\t\t\tsegments.get(index).brighterColor();\r\n\t\t\trepaint();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic void darkerArcModelColor(int index) {\r\n\t\t\tsegments.get(index).darkerColor();\r\n\t\t\trepaint();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tprotected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {\r\n\t\t\tsuper.paintComponent(g);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tGraphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) g;\r\n\r\n\t\t\tfor (ArcModel arcModel : segments) {\r\n\t\t\t\tg2d.setPaint(arcModel.getColor());\r\n\t\t\t\tRectangle r = arcModel.getRectangle();\r\n\t\t\t\tg2d.fill(new Arc2D.Double(r.getX(), r.getY(), r.getWidth(), r\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t.getHeight(), arcModel.getStartingAngle(), arcModel\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t.getExtent(), arcModel.getClosureType()));\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nHere, we create a List of ArcModel segments.  We set the size of the drawing panel based on the margin and diameter of the circle we want to create with the segments.\r\n\r\nWe have two methods, one for brightening a color of a segment, and another for darkening a color of a segment.\r\n\r\nWe do the drawing in the paintComponent method.  Since we created the ArcModel class, the actual drawing is straightforward.  The paintComponent method does nothing but draw the pie slices of the circle.\r\n\r\nNext, we look at the main SimonShape class.  This class creates the game model and creates the GUI.\r\n\r\n    public class SimonShape implements Runnable {\r\n    \r\n    \tprivate GameModel gameModel;\r\n    \r\n    \tprivate JFrame frame;\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    \t\tSwingUtilities.invokeLater(new SimonShape());\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic SimonShape() {\r\n    \t\tthis.gameModel = new GameModel();\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \t@Override\r\n    \tpublic void run() {\r\n    \t\tframe = new JFrame(&quot;Simon Says&quot;);\r\n    \t\tframe.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\r\n    \r\n    \t\tDrawingPanel drawingPanel = new DrawingPanel();\r\n    \t\tframe.add(drawingPanel);\r\n    \r\n    \t\tframe.pack();\r\n    \t\tframe.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\r\n    \t\tframe.setVisible(true);\r\n    \r\n    \t\tGameRunnable runnable = new GameRunnable(drawingPanel, gameModel);\r\n    \t\tnew Thread(runnable).start();\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe last two lines of the run method create the animation.\r\n\r\nThe controller class is the GameRunnable class.  I wrote enough code to have the computer pick 10 random segments, and display the sequence of the segments.  I&#39;m leaving the rest of the game code up to you.  It will go in the GameRunnable class.\r\n\r\n\tpublic class GameRunnable implements Runnable {\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate volatile boolean running;\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate DrawingPanel drawingPanel;\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate GameModel gameModel;\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic GameRunnable(DrawingPanel drawingPanel, GameModel gameModel) {\r\n\t\t\tthis.drawingPanel = drawingPanel;\r\n\t\t\tthis.gameModel = gameModel;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tpublic void run() {\r\n\t\t\trunning = true;\r\n\t\t\twhile (running &amp;&amp; gameModel.getComputerSequence().size() &lt; 10) {\r\n\t\t\t\tgenerateComputerSequence();\r\n\t\t\t\tsleep(1800L);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate void generateComputerSequence() {\r\n\r\n\t\t\tgameModel.addToComputerSequence();\r\n\t\t\tfor (Integer index : gameModel.getComputerSequence()) {\r\n\t\t\t\tdrawingPanel.brighterArcModelColor(index);\r\n\t\t\t\tsleep(1000L);\r\n\t\t\t\tdrawingPanel.darkerArcModelColor(index);\r\n\t\t\t\tsleep(200L);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate void sleep(long duration) {\r\n\t\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\t\tThread.sleep(duration);\r\n\t\t\t} catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic synchronized void setRunning(boolean running) {\r\n\t\t\tthis.running = running;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nRemember, divide and conquer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\r\n  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/y5qLJ.png","title":"Simon Says won&#39;t show sequence","body":"<p>When creating any Swing GUI, you should always use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">model / view / controller pattern</a>.

The ArcModel class is another plain Java object that holds a slice.</p>\n<pre><code>public class ArcModel {\n\n    private final int closureType;\n\n    private final double startingAngle;\n    private final double extent;\n\n    private Color color;\n    private final Color originalColor;\n\n    private final Rectangle rectangle;\n\n    public ArcModel(Color color, Rectangle rectangle, double startingAngle,\n            double extent, int closureType) {\n        this.color = color;\n        this.originalColor = color;\n        this.rectangle = rectangle;\n        this.startingAngle = startingAngle;\n        this.extent = extent;\n        this.closureType = closureType;\n    }\n\n    public int getClosureType() {\n        return closureType;\n    }\n\n    public double getStartingAngle() {\n        return startingAngle;\n    }\n\n    public double getExtent() {\n        return extent;\n    }\n\n    public Rectangle getRectangle() {\n        return rectangle;\n    }\n\n    public Color getColor() {\n        return color;\n    }\n\n    public void brighterColor() {\n        this.color = Color.WHITE;\n    }\n\n    public void darkerColor() {\n        this.color = originalColor;\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In addition to the getters and setters, we have a method to brighten the color and a method to darken the color.  I've set the bright color to white to make it more easily visible.</p>\n<p>Now that we've created the model classes, let's look at the view classes.  The first view class is the DrawingPanel class.</p>\n<pre><code>public class DrawingPanel extends JPanel {\n\n    private static final long serialVersionUID = 70146219705119575L;\n\n    private List&lt;ArcModel&gt; segments;\n\n    public DrawingPanel() {\n        this.segments = new ArrayList&lt;ArcModel&gt;();\n\n        int margin = 50;\n        int diameter = 300;\n        Rectangle r = new Rectangle(margin, margin, diameter, diameter);\n\n        segments.add(new ArcModel(Color.GREEN, r, 180, 90, Arc2D.PIE));\n        segments.add(new ArcModel(Color.BLUE, r, 270, 90, Arc2D.PIE));\n        segments.add(new ArcModel(Color.RED, r, 360, 90, Arc2D.PIE));\n        segments.add(new ArcModel(Color.YELLOW, r, 90, 90, Arc2D.PIE));\n\n        int width = diameter + margin + margin;\n        this.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(width, width));\n    }\n\n    public void brighterArcModelColor(int index) {\n        segments.get(index).brighterColor();\n        repaint();\n    }\n\n    public void darkerArcModelColor(int index) {\n        segments.get(index).darkerColor();\n        repaint();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {\n        super.paintComponent(g);\n\n        Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) g;\n\n        for (ArcModel arcModel : segments) {\n            g2d.setPaint(arcModel.getColor());\n            Rectangle r = arcModel.getRectangle();\n            g2d.fill(new Arc2D.Double(r.getX(), r.getY(), r.getWidth(), r\n                    .getHeight(), arcModel.getStartingAngle(), arcModel\n                    .getExtent(), arcModel.getClosureType()));\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, we create a List of ArcModel segments.  We set the size of the drawing panel based on the margin and diameter of the circle we want to create with the segments.</p>\n<p>We have two methods, one for brightening a color of a segment, and another for darkening a color of a segment.</p>\n<p>We do the drawing in the paintComponent method.  Since we created the ArcModel class, the actual drawing is straightforward.  The paintComponent method does nothing but draw the pie slices of the circle.</p>\n<p>Next, we look at the main SimonShape class.  This class creates the game model and creates the GUI.</p>\n<pre><code>public class SimonShape implements Runnable {\n\n    private GameModel gameModel;\n\n    private JFrame frame;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new SimonShape());\n    }\n\n    public SimonShape() {\n        this.gameModel = new GameModel();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        frame = new JFrame(&quot;Simon Says&quot;);\n        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n\n        DrawingPanel drawingPanel = new DrawingPanel();\n        frame.add(drawingPanel);\n\n        frame.pack();\n        frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\n        frame.setVisible(true);\n\n        GameRunnable runnable = new GameRunnable(drawingPanel, gameModel);\n        new Thread(runnable).start();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The last two lines of the run method create the animation.</p>\n<p>The controller class is the GameRunnable class.  I wrote enough code to have the computer pick 10 random segments, and display the sequence of the segments.  I'm leaving the rest of the game code up to you.  It will go in the GameRunnable class.</p>\n<pre><code>public class GameRunnable implements Runnable {\n\n    private volatile boolean running;\n\n    private DrawingPanel drawingPanel;\n\n    private GameModel gameModel;\n\n    public GameRunnable(DrawingPanel drawingPanel, GameModel gameModel) {\n        this.drawingPanel = drawingPanel;\n        this.gameModel = gameModel;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        running = true;\n        while (running &amp;&amp; gameModel.getComputerSequence().size() &lt; 10) {\n            generateComputerSequence();\n            sleep(1800L);\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void generateComputerSequence() {\n\n        gameModel.addToComputerSequence();\n        for (Integer index : gameModel.getComputerSequence()) {\n            drawingPanel.brighterArcModelColor(index);\n            sleep(1000L);\n            drawingPanel.darkerArcModelColor(index);\n            sleep(200L);\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    private void sleep(long duration) {\n        try {\n            Thread.sleep(duration);\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n\n        }\n    }\n\n    public synchronized void setRunning(boolean running) {\n        this.running = running;\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Remember, divide and conquer.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":6721213,"reputation":81,"user_id":5181166,"accept_rate":0,"display_name":"Ryan Hardin"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":258,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1636708448,"creation_date":1444324599,"question_id":33022133,"body_markdown":"Below is a Simon Says program I am working on.

Among its many problems are these pass-the-units-flag methods. Fortunately, you can now forget all about this class. \r\n\r\nThe *java.time* classes built into Java 8 and later now supplant the legacy date-time classes.\r\n\r\n## `LocalDate`\r\n\r\nThe [`LocalDate`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/time/LocalDate.html) class represents a date-only value without time-of-day and without time zone.\r\n\r\nA time zone is crucial in determining a date. For any given moment, the date varies around the globe by zone. For example, a few minutes after midnight in [Paris France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe/Paris) is a new day while still “yesterday” in [Montr&#233;al Qu&#233;bec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America/Montreal).\r\n\r\nIf no time zone is specified, the JVM implicitly applies its current default time zone. That default may change at any moment, so your results may vary. Better to specify your desired/expected time zone explicitly as an argument.\r\n\r\nSpecify a [proper time zone name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_zones_by_name) in the format of `continent/region`, such as [`America/Montreal`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America/Montreal), [`Africa/Casablanca`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa/Casablanca), or `Pacific/Auckland`. Never use the 3-4 letter abbreviation such as `EST` or `IST` as they are *not* true time zones, not standardized, and not even unique(!). \r\n\r\n    ZoneId z = ZoneId.of( &quot;America/Montreal&quot; ) ;  \r\n    LocalDate today = LocalDate.now( z ) ;\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the JVM’s current default time zone, ask for it and pass as an argument. If omitted, the JVM’s current default is applied implicitly. Better to be explicit, as the default may be changed at any moment *during runtime* by any code in any thread of any app within the JVM.\r\n\r\n    ZoneId z = ZoneId.systemDefault() ;  // Get JVM’s current default time zone.\r\n\r\n\r\nOr specify a date. You may set the month by a number, with sane numbering 1-12 for January-December. \r\n\r\n    LocalDate ld = LocalDate.of( 1986 , 2 , 23 ) ;  // Years use sane direct numbering (1986 means year 1986). Months use sane numbering, 1-12 for January-December.\r\n\r\nOr, better, use the [`Month`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/time/Month.html) enum objects pre-defined, one for each month of the year. Tip: Use these `Month` objects throughout your codebase rather than a mere integer number to make your code more self-documenting, ensure valid values, and provide [type-safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety).\r\n\r\n    LocalDate ld = LocalDate.of( 1986 , Month.FEBRUARY , 23 ) ;\r\n\r\n## Parts\r\n\r\nWith a `LocalDate` in hand, you may interrogate for its parts.\r\n\r\nTo get the day-of-month, that is, the &quot;date&quot; such as `23` from January 23, 2018:\r\n\r\n    int dayOfMonth = ld.getDayOfMonth() ; // 1-31, depending on length of month.\r\n\r\nTo get the nth day of the year, from 1-365, or in a leap year, 1-366:\r\n\r\n    int dayOfYear = ld.getDayOfYear() ;\r\n\r\n## Math\r\n\r\n**Adding or subtracting days is quite simple** and intuitive in java.time. Convenience methods and span-of-time objects make the code much more clear.\r\n\r\n    LocalDate dayLater = ld.plusDays( 1 ) ;\r\n\r\nSo getting tomorrow would be:\r\n\r\n    LocalDate tomorrow = LocalDate.now( ZoneId.of( &quot;Africa/Tunis&quot; ) ).plusDays( 1 ) ;\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can represent a span-of-time unattached to the timeline. For years-months-days, use `Period`. For hours-minutes-seconds, use `Duration`.\r\n\r\n    Period p = Period.ofDays( 1 ) ;\r\n    LocalDate dayLater = ld.plus( p ) ;\r\n\r\nNote that java.time uses **sane numbering**, unlike the legacy classes. The number `2018` is the year 2018. Months are numbered 1-12 for January-December. Days of the week are numbered 1-7 for Monday-Sunday, per the [ISO 8601][1] standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n# About *java.time*\r\n\r\nThe [*java.time*](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html) framework is built into Java 8 and later. These classes supplant the troublesome old [legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system) date-time classes such as [`java.util.Date`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Date.html), [`Calendar`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html), &amp; [`SimpleDateFormat`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html).\r\n\r\nThe [*Joda-Time*](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) project, now in [maintenance mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_mode), advises migration to the [java.time](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html) classes.\r\n\r\nTo learn more, see the [*Oracle Tutorial*](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/TOC.html). And search Stack Overflow for many examples and explanations. Specification is [JSR 310](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310).\r\n\r\nWhere to obtain the java.time classes? \r\n\r\n - [**Java SE 8**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_8), [**Java SE 9**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_9), and later\r\n  - Built-in. \r\n  - Part of the standard Java API with a bundled implementation.\r\n  - Java 9 adds some minor features and fixes.\r\n - [**Java SE 6**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_6) and [**Java SE 7**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_7)\r\n  - Much of the java.time functionality is back-ported to Java 6 &amp; 7 in [***ThreeTen-Backport***](http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/).\r\n - [**Android**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system))\r\n  - Later versions of Android bundle implementations of the java.time classes.\r\n  - For earlier Android, the [***ThreeTenABP***](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP) project adapts *ThreeTen-Backport* (mentioned above). See [*How to use ThreeTenABP…*](http://stackoverflow.com/q/38922754/642706).\r\n\r\nThe [**ThreeTen-Extra**](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/) project extends java.time with additional classes. This project is a proving ground for possible future additions to java.time. You may find some useful classes here such as [`Interval`](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/Interval.html), [`YearWeek`](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/YearWeek.html), [`YearQuarter`](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/YearQuarter.html), and [more](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/index.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601","title":"What&#39;s the difference between adding DAY_OF_MONTH or DAY_OF_YEAR to a Calendar object?","body":"<h1>tl;dr</h1>\n\n<pre><code>LocalDate.of( 2012 , Month.JANUARY , 31 )\n    .plusDays( 1 )\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2012-02-01</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>…or…</p>\n\n<pre><code>LocalDate.of( 2012 , 1 , 31 )  // Sane numbering: 1-12 for January-December, and `2012` means year 2012.\n    .plusDays( 1 )\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2012-02-01</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1>java.time</h1>\n\n<p>The <code>Calendar</code> class is confusing, awkward, and poorly designed.

You could also write:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Parent root = FXMLLoader.load(getClass().getResource(\"/sample.fxml\"));\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3654099,"reputation":1919,"user_id":3045568,"accept_rate":33,"display_name":"Techidiot"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1442409903,"creation_date":1442408979,"answer_id":32609555,"question_id":22000423,"body_markdown":"For me I had took care of following things - \r\n\r\n1.

But when I try to run the application I get the following error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Exception in Application start method\njava.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)\n        at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Unknown Source)\n        at com.javafx.main.Main.launchApp(Main.java:698)\n        at com.javafx.main.Main.main(Main.java:871)\nCaused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Exception in Application start method\n        at com.sun.javafx.application.LauncherImpl.launchApplication1(Unknown So\nurce)\n        at com.sun.javafx.application.LauncherImpl.access$000(Unknown Source)\n        at com.sun.javafx.application.LauncherImpl$1.run(Unknown Source)\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)\nCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: Location is required.\n        at javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader.load(Unknown Source)\n        at javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader.load(Unknown Source)\n        at javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader.load(Unknown Source)\n        at javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader.load(Unknown Source)\n        at javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader.load(Unknown Source)\n        at sample.Main.start(Main.java:15)\n        at com.sun.javafx.application.LauncherImpl$5.run(Unknown Source)\n        at com.sun.javafx.application.PlatformImpl$5.run(Unknown Source)\n        at com.sun.javafx.application.PlatformImpl$4$1.run(Unknown Source)\n        at com.sun.javafx.application.PlatformImpl$4$1.run(Unknown Source)\n        at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)\n        at com.sun.javafx.application.PlatformImpl$4.run(Unknown Source)\n        at com.sun.glass.ui.InvokeLaterDispatcher$Future.run(Unknown Source)\n        at com.sun.glass.ui.win.WinApplication._runLoop(Native Method)\n        at com.sun.glass.ui.win.WinApplication.access$100(Unknown Source)\n        at com.sun.glass.ui.win.WinApplication$3$1.run(Unknown Source)\n        ... 1 more\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After some rough debugging the trouble seems to be in the path I am loading my files from. After hardcoding the <code>sample.fxml</code> to a place on my hard drive, the application runs without any problems. Same goes for the current setup (seen above) when running the application from IntelliJ.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like I have exhausted every resource (including StackOverflow, some very similar errors) but I just can't figure out what exactly is wrong.</p>\n"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":8134,"page":1858,"page_size":100}
