So deleting this copy with some invalid options inside fixes the problem.</p>\n<p>If a VMOPTIONS file doesn't exist in the above path, Go to this location <strong>C:\\Program Files\\JetBrains\\IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition xxxx.x.x\\bin</strong> and run the <strong>idea.bat</strong> file. Not the exe file. This should fix any and all other problems and let you open the application with out getting that error.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":14388066,"reputation":301,"user_id":10393457,"display_name":"SztefanWons"},"score":1,"creation_date":1629977048,"post_id":66376353,"comment_id":121832778,"body_markdown":"Thanks a lot.

How can I make it smaller?\r\n##### Details\r\nOracle Java 1.8.0_201 (32 bit)\r\n\r\nI have a Dell laptop.  \r\nWindows 11 Pro (version 22H2)  \r\nProcessor: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1145G7 @ 2.60GHz   1.50 GHz  \r\nInstalled RAM: 16.0 GB (15.4 GB usable)\r\n\r\nI am using a virtual desktop via [Citrix][1]. Virtual desktop has Windows 10 (Enterprise, 64 bit). It also has 16 GB of memory.\r\n\r\nBelow is a screen capture of a [`JOptionPane`][2] on the virtual desktop.\r\n\r\n[![JOptionPane (good)][3]][3]\r\n\r\nThis is correct and how it should be.  \r\nHowever, on another computer, using the same configuration as described above, it looks different. Here is a screen capture of the other computer. Note that the other computer is the exact same laptop as mine.\r\n\r\n[![JOptionPane (bad)][4]][4]\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that the size of the font of the window title is bigger than it should be. How can I make it smaller?\r\n\r\nNote that the displays of both computers are the same, i.e. scaling is set to 100% and screen resolution is 1920&amp;times;1080  \r\nAre there other settings that I should check?\r\n\r\nAlso note that both computers use a dual monitor docking station as demonstrated in this [YouTube video][5].\r\n\r\n##### EDIT\r\nGranted, regarding the screen captures above, the differences don&#39;t impact the GUI, however they do impact the main application window, i.e. the application&#39;s top-level [`JFrame`][6] as shown in below screen capture.\r\n\r\n[![Application JFrame][7]][7]\r\n\r\nI have purposely removed the window title (for confidentiality purposes), however the font size is larger than it should be and as a result, the toolbar at the bottom of the window is only partially displayed and this is the problem. The `JFrame` dimensions are fixed (i.e. hard coded) and since the window title takes up more height (due to the larger font size), it comes at the expense of the toolbar height. Changing the window dimensions &amp;ndash; including removing them entirely in order to let _Swing_ determine the optimal window size &amp;ndash; is not an option. Hence I believe that the solution is to reduce the size of the font used in the window title bar.\r\n\r\nThe application was purchased from a third party. It runs on thousands of computers with the exact same configuration as mine (as described above, including the exact same Dell laptop and virtual desktop) but the problem occurs on only a very few (less than ten). Also, the application has been in use for several years, initially on PCs. The problem only began when we moved from each person having his own, dedicated [physical] PC to the environment described above, i.e. a virtual desktop on a laptop in a dual monitor docking station.\r\n##### EDIT 2 (15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May, 2023)\r\nTo clarify regarding the virtual desktop. Via *Citrix* desktop we are connecting to an actual, physical computer and not a virtual computer, hence the display settings are those of the physical computer.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.citrix.com/solutions/vdi-and-daas/what-is-a-virtual-desktop.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/JOptionPane.html\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/gYKpm.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/HD7I0.png\r\n  [5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wad99tLquX8\r\n  [6]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/toplevel.html\r\n  [7]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/22r9v.png","title":"Window title font too big","body":"<h5>TL;DR</h5>\n<p>Size of font in title bar of <em>Swing</em> windows is too big.

The <code>JFrame</code> dimensions are fixed (i.e. hard coded) and since the window title takes up more height (due to the larger font size), it comes at the expense of the toolbar height. Changing the window dimensions – including removing them entirely in order to let <em>Swing</em> determine the optimal window size – is not an option. Hence I believe that the solution is to reduce the size of the font used in the window title bar.</p>\n<p>The application was purchased from a third party. It runs on thousands of computers with the exact same configuration as mine (as described above, including the exact same Dell laptop and virtual desktop) but the problem occurs on only a very few (less than ten). Also, the application has been in use for several years, initially on PCs. The problem only began when we moved from each person having his own, dedicated [physical] PC to the environment described above, i.e. a virtual desktop on a laptop in a dual monitor docking station.</p>\n<h5>EDIT 2 (15<sup>th</sup> May, 2023)</h5>\n<p>To clarify regarding the virtual desktop. Via <em>Citrix</em> desktop we are connecting to an actual, physical computer and not a virtual computer, hence the display settings are those of the physical computer.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","performance"],"owner":{"account_id":1931992,"reputation":4921,"user_id":1741203,"accept_rate":57,"display_name":"Rajeev Kumar"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1685086287,"creation_date":1685086287,"question_id":76338575,"body_markdown":"In my android app, i am running `Animator Set` periodically from a thread using following code \r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n     mSetLeftIn = (AnimatorSet) AnimatorInflater.loadAnimator(this, R.animator.in_animator);\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n     private class OnlineStatusTimer implements Runnable {\r\n        // @Override\r\n        public void run() {\r\n            while (!(Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted() || objSharedPref.GetAppStringPrefByKey(R.string.session_key).equals(&quot;&quot;))) {\r\n                try {\r\n                    SetOnlineStatusTime();\r\n                    Thread.sleep(10000); // Pause of 10 Second\r\n                } catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\r\n                } catch (Exception e) {\r\n                    FirebaseCrashlytics.getInstance().recordException(e);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void SetOnlineStatusTime() {\r\n        runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {\r\n            public void run() {\r\n                try {                  \r\n                    if (objDriverBalStat != null &amp;&amp; objDriverBalStat.Balance &gt; 0) { // driver has outstanding balance to pay\r\n                        StartAnimation(); // start animating outstanding balance layout and bike info layout\r\n                    }\r\n                } catch (Exception e) {\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n     public void StartAnimation() {\r\n        if (!bDateLayoutVisible) {         \r\n            mSetLeftIn.setTarget(layoutDateBikeInfo);\r\n            if(!mSetLeftIn.isRunning()) {\r\n                mSetLeftIn.start();\r\n                bDateLayoutVisible = true;\r\n            }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n\r\nApp runs fine for 2-3 mins and then start freezing.

Depending on  how you want you keys to behave, you can use the `hashCode` / `equals` methods implemented by `java.lang.Object` ... or you can override them.\r\n\r\n&gt; Or if someone could give a good and simple explanation of how hashing work, I would really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nI suggest you read the Wikipedia page on [Hash Tables][1] to understand how they work.  (FWIW, the `HashMap` and `HashTable` classes use &quot;separate chaining with linked lists&quot;, and some other tweaks to optimize average performance.

How it does this is up to the implementor.  But a common approach is to combine hashcodes of the object&#39;s fields something like this:\r\n\r\n      hashcode = (..((field1.hashcode * prime) + field2.hashcode) * prime + ...)\r\n\r\nwhere `prime` is a smallish prime number like `31`.  The key is that you get a good spread of hashcode values for different keys.  What you DON&#39;T want is lots of keys all hashing to the same value.  That causes &quot;collisions&quot; and is bad for performance.\r\n\r\nWhen you implement the `hashcode` and `equals` methods, you need to do it in a way that satisfies the following constraints for the hash table to work correctly:\r\n\r\n     1. O1.equals(o2) =&gt; o1.hashcode() == o2.hashcode()\r\n     2. o2.equals(o2) == o2.equals(o1)\r\n     3.
