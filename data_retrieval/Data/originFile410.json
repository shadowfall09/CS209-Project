Given that that behind scenes that dictionary can be save in almost a random order you can&#39;t retrieve something in order. However I can recommend a couple of solutions:\r\n\r\n 1. **The easy not good performance one:** Add as part of the value the index, therefore you can create an array with the size of the Hashset and then iterate the Hashset and add every element in the array that you created. O(N) temporal complexity plus the one involved in the reading process of the file.\r\n 2. **Saved the data in a local SQLite database:** This solution is more flexible in future terms (you can add new contacts). https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/sqlite.html Usually you create your own SQLite database that you put in assets and then you just import it. You can create queries to bring them in the order that you want (maybe create a column for that).\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n        InputStream myInput = context.getAssets( ).open( &quot;test.db&quot; );\r\n    \r\n        // Path to the just created empty db\r\n        String outFileName = &quot;/data/YOUR_APP/test.db&quot;;\r\n    \r\n        // Open the empty db as the output stream\r\n        OutputStream myOutput = new FileOutputStream( outFileName );\r\n    \r\n        // transfer bytes from the inputfile to the outputfile\r\n        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\r\n        int length;\r\n        while( ( length = myInput.read( buffer ) ) &gt; 0 )\r\n        {\r\n            myOutput.write( buffer, 0, length );\r\n        }\r\n        // Close the streams\r\n        myOutput.flush( );\r\n        myOutput.close( );\r\n        myInput.close( );\r\n\r\n 3. **Simple not scalable option:** In the values `folder` you can always create a `strings.xml` file where you can put that data as a `string-array`. https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html?hl=en\r\n\r\n    `&lt;string-array name=&quot;types&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;item&gt;A&lt;/item&gt;\r\n            &lt;item&gt;B and users&lt;/item&gt;\r\n            &lt;item&gt;C&lt;/item&gt;\r\n            &lt;item&gt;D&lt;/item&gt;\r\n            &lt;item&gt;E&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        &lt;/string-array&gt;`\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you need something more structured I have done stuff like this (saved as JSON).\r\n\r\n    &lt;string-array name=&quot;quality_attributes&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;item&gt;{id:1,name:Performance,sub:[{id:2,name:Scalability},{id:3,name:Response_Time}]}&lt;/item&gt;\r\n            &lt;item&gt;{id:4,name:Security,sub:[{id:5,name:Availability,sub:[{id:6,name:Reliability},{id:7,name:Recovery}]},{id:8,name:Privacy}]}&lt;/item&gt;\r\n            &lt;item&gt;{id:9,name:Interoperability}&lt;/item&gt;\r\n            &lt;item&gt;{id:10,name:Maintainability}&lt;/item&gt;\r\n            &lt;item&gt;{id:12,name:Testability}&lt;/item&gt;\r\n            &lt;item&gt;{id:13,name:Usability,sub:[{id:14,name:Findability},{id:15,name:Correctness}]}&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        &lt;/string-array&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd in my code:\r\n\r\n    String[] elementsArray = getResources().getStringArray(\r\n    \t\t\t\tR.array.quality_attributes);\r\n    \r\n    \t\tfor (int i = 0; i &lt; attributesArray.length; i++) {\r\n    \t\t\tGson gson = new Gson();\r\n    \t\t\tMyJsonObject obj = gson.fromJson(elementsArray[i],\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tMyJsonObject.class);\r\n               // Do something\r\n    \t\t}\r\n\r\nIn general terms if you want something that needs to be change, the second options is the best one.

You can create queries to bring them in the order that you want (maybe create a column for that).</p>\n\n<pre><code>InputStream myInput = context.getAssets( ).open( \"test.db\" );\n\n// Path to the just created empty db\nString outFileName = \"/data/YOUR_APP/test.db\";\n\n// Open the empty db as the output stream\nOutputStream myOutput = new FileOutputStream( outFileName );\n\n// transfer bytes from the inputfile to the outputfile\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\nint length;\nwhile( ( length = myInput.read( buffer ) ) &gt; 0 )\n{\n    myOutput.write( buffer, 0, length );\n}\n// Close the streams\nmyOutput.flush( );\nmyOutput.close( );\nmyInput.close( );\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p><strong>Simple not scalable option:</strong> In the values <code>folder</code> you can always create a <code>strings.xml</code> file where you can put that data as a <code>string-array</code>. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html?hl=en</a></p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;string-array name=\"types\"&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;A&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;B and users&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;C&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;D&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;E&lt;/item&gt;\n    &lt;/string-array&gt;</code></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you need something more structured I have done stuff like this (saved as JSON).</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;string-array name=\"quality_attributes\"&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;{id:1,name:Performance,sub:[{id:2,name:Scalability},{id:3,name:Response_Time}]}&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;{id:4,name:Security,sub:[{id:5,name:Availability,sub:[{id:6,name:Reliability},{id:7,name:Recovery}]},{id:8,name:Privacy}]}&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;{id:9,name:Interoperability}&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;{id:10,name:Maintainability}&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;{id:12,name:Testability}&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;{id:13,name:Usability,sub:[{id:14,name:Findability},{id:15,name:Correctness}]}&lt;/item&gt;\n    &lt;/string-array&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And in my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>String[] elementsArray = getResources().getStringArray(\n                R.array.quality_attributes);\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; attributesArray.length; i++) {\n            Gson gson = new Gson();\n            MyJsonObject obj = gson.fromJson(elementsArray[i],\n                    MyJsonObject.class);\n           // Do something\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In general terms if you want something that needs to be change, the second options is the best one.

Not a big deal, since that info is pretty easy to google, but ideally it would be nice if there was an API that could readily provide the info, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>code.append(\"Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; map = \");\nif (javax.meta.JavaVersion.getCurrentVersion().supportsDiamond()) {\n    code.append(\"new Map&lt;&gt;();\");\n} else {\n    code.append(\"new Map&lt;Integer, String&gt;();\");\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Obviously there's no package named <code>javax.meta</code>, but I was wondering if there might already be an existing solution for this problem that's cleaner than parsing the <code>\"java.specification.version\"</code> property.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Update</em>: I just realized that <code>Package#getSpecificationVersion()</code> also provides the same value as <code>System.getProperty(\"java.specification.version\")</code> but is probably more reliable, because System properties are mutable.  In other words, the best way to get the Java spec version is probably to call <code>Package#getSpecificationVersion()</code> on any \"built-in\" package.

Before executing a query, the filter is enabled and necessary data bound to it. With the help of some `AutoCloseable`, the filter is disabled for the current session again after the query was executed and some list of entities retrieved. The good thing about filters is that those are applied independently of the current query and one doesn&#39;t need to care too much.\r\n\r\nBut here&#39;s the problem: The referenced entities of the elements in that list are lazy-loaded by Hibernate and that only works as expected within the `AutoCloseable`, because afterwards the filter is disabled again and the query results are wrong.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48449118/hibernate-defaultentityaliases-raises-nullpointerexception\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not familiar the jpa too much but here is the better solution than using the `@Formula` annotation.\r\n\r\nFirst you need to create a custom Dialect \r\nHere is the example:\r\n```\r\npublic class CustomMariaDB53Dialect extends MariaDB53Dialect {\r\n    private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(CustomMariaDB53Dialect.class);\r\n\r\n    public CustomMariaDB53Dialect() {\r\n        super();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then register a function to the Dialect\r\nHere is the code:\r\n```\r\npublic class CustomMariaDB53Dialect extends MariaDB53Dialect {\r\n    private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(CustomMariaDB53Dialect.class);\r\n\r\n    public CustomMariaDB53Dialect() {\r\n        super();\r\n        registerFunction(&quot;convertEncode&quot;, new SQLFunctionTemplate(StandardBasicTypes.STRING, &quot;convert(?1 using ?2)&quot;));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first param of the `registerFunction` method is function name.\r\n\r\nThe second is a implement of `SqlFunction`\r\n\r\nThe `?1` and `?2` means the args of the function\r\nSo the function template is `convert(?1 using ?2)`\r\n\r\nAfter above stpes done. \r\n\r\nYou should tell the hibernate you are using a new Dialect\r\n\r\nThe path of the config is `hibernate.dialect`\r\n\r\nHere is the example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhibernate.dialect=xxx.xxx.CustomMariaDB53Dialect \r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using spring boot jpa.\r\n\r\nHere is the config:\r\n```\r\nspring:\r\n  jpa:\r\n    hibernate:\r\n    properties:\r\n      hibernate:\r\n        dialect: xxx.xxx.CustomMariaDB53Dialect\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last step is to use the function in your query.\r\n\r\nHere is the example:\r\n```\r\nExpression&lt;String&gt; countryName = builder().function(\r\n                        &quot;convertEncode&quot;, \r\n                        String.class,\r\n                        join.get(Country_.NAME),\r\n                        builder().literal(&quot;gbk&quot;)\r\n                );\r\n\r\n                return direction.isDescending() ? builder().desc(countryName ) : builder().asc(countryName );\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the final sql:\r\n\r\n```\r\norder by convert(expert0_.name_zh using ?) asc limit ?\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheers!!!","title":"how to call the function that was using mysql keywords as parameters by the criteria

second is a implement of <code>SqlFunction</code></p>\n\n<p>The <code>?1</code> and <code>?2</code> means the args of the function\nSo the function template is <code>convert(?1 using

A minimal set is likely to be: open, close, read, write.</p>\n\n<p>I'd start simple - with either the bottom or the top (either direction could work).  Since you'll need an application anyway (test code if nothing else), you might start there.  You'll successively refine the code adding extra layers, ensuring the previous functionality continues to work.  You'll have to work out how the application layer conveys to the data link layer the information that it needs - so that the correct socket calls can be made, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Have fun.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"display_name":"John"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":4665,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":4707404,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1685028040,"creation_date":1295185604,"question_id":4705675,"body_markdown":"I am studying networking and OSI model and all 7 layers.\r\nLike how each layer puts its own header and then removes on the receiver end.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any way that i can create the program in java or c or c++ and i manually perform each step which is done at layers so that i actually know how it actually works\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nok first consider locally\r\nFor example i have data word &quot;hello&quot; and i want to send it to another running program simulating the OSI model.

Here&#39;s an example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)\r\nclass MyTestClass {\r\n\r\n    MyHeavyResource sharedResource;\r\n\r\n\t@BeforeAll\r\n\tvoid init() {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;init&quot;);\r\n        sharedResource = new MyHeavyResource(1234);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void myTest() {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;myTest&quot;);\r\n        sharedResource.methodUnderTest();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnderstanding `Lifecycle.PER_CLASS`\r\n----------------------------------\r\nThe likely reason JUnit 5 is more stringent with this -- demanding either `static` or `Lifecycle.PER_CLASS` -- is that it wants the test author to acknowledge that any resource instance initialized in a `@BeforeAll` method will genuinely be shared across each individual unit test method within the class.  This could compromise their isolation, for example if the `sharedResource` in the above example isn&#39;t stateless/idempotent.\r\n\r\nIf `sharedResource` cannot be safely shared  (or if it&#39;s reasonably leightweight), the `init` method should be annotated with `@BeforeEach` instead, which would create a new instance before executing each individual test within the class.\r\n\r\n[The Javadoc for `TestInstance`][1] explain how using `Lifecycle.PER_CLASS` actually enforces a single instance of the test class; whereas the behaviour of JUnit 4 and earlier was equivalent to `Lifecycle.PER_METHOD`, which created a new instance of the test class for each `@Test` method contained therein.

This could compromise their isolation, for example if the <code>sharedResource</code> in the above example isn't stateless/idempotent.</p>\n<p>If <code>sharedResource</code> cannot be safely shared  (or if it's reasonably leightweight), the <code>init</code> method should be annotated with <code>@BeforeEach</code> instead, which would create a new instance before executing each individual test within the class.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/api/org.junit.jupiter.api/org/junit/jupiter/api/TestInstance.Lifecycle.html#PER_CLASS\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Javadoc for <code>TestInstance</code></a> explain how using <code>Lifecycle.PER_CLASS</code> actually enforces a single instance of the test class; whereas the behaviour of JUnit 4 and earlier was equivalent to <code>Lifecycle.PER_METHOD</code>, which created a new instance of the test class for each <code>@Test</code> method contained therein.  This would somewhat mislead the author to suppose that <code>@Before</code> was only executed once for each of those tests.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4528798,"reputation":10533,"user_id":3679900,"accept_rate":48,"display_name":"y2k-shubham"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1685024542,"creation_date":1685024542,"answer_id":76333346,"question_id":10580613,"body_markdown":" - In my case I just moved stuff from `@Before` / `@BeforeEach` annotated `setUp()` method to the constructor of my unit-test class.\r\n - As per [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6094143/3679900) using constructor is &#39;equivalent&#39; to `@Before` method\r\n\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t explain why it fixed the problem but I was facing this in one particular class and it did indeed do the trick.","title":"@After ,@before not working in testcase","body":"<ul>\n<li>In my case I just moved stuff from <code>@Before</code> / <code>@BeforeEach</code> annotated <code>setUp()</code> method to the constructor of my unit-test class.</li>\n<li>As per <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/6094143/3679900\">this thread</a> using constructor is 'equivalent' to <code>@Before</code> method</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I can't explain why it fixed the problem but I was facing this in one particular class and it did indeed do the trick.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1169956,"reputation":2366,"user_id":1147361,"accept_rate":61,"display_name":"abhishek ameta"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":80580,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":47,"accepted_answer_id":10585603,"answer_count":8,"score":47,"last_activity_date":1685024542,"creation_date":1336987598,"question_id":10580613,"body_markdown":"I have started testing and now i want to use `@After`, `@Before` and `@Test` but my application only runs the `@Before` method and gives output on console\r\n&gt; before\r\n\r\nHowever, if I remove `@After` and `@Before` it runs the @Test.
