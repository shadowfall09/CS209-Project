So to achieve the same I am using JSch API to make SFTP connection.\r\n\r\nSince JSch doesn&#39;t provide any method to copy any file remotely, so I am using Unix `cp` command  for the same. However there is rename command to move the file.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that when I am running the program file is not getting copied but moving successfully. It seems the reason is that Unix copy command is taking time to perform the action but before that move command is getting executed.

example and some explanation in https://github.com/surasint/surasint-examples/tree/master/spring-boot-jdbi/10_spring-boot-two-databases (see what you can try in README.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\nI copied some code here.\r\n\r\nFirst you have to set application.properties like this\r\n\r\n    #Database\r\n    database1.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/testdb\r\n    database1.datasource.username=root\r\n    database1.datasource.password=root\r\n    database1.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\r\n    \r\n    database2.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/testdb2\r\n    database2.datasource.username=root\r\n    database2.datasource.password=root\r\n    database2.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\r\n\r\nThen define them as providers (@Bean) like this:\r\n\r\n    @Bean(name = &quot;datasource1&quot;)\r\n    @ConfigurationProperties(&quot;database1.datasource&quot;)\r\n    @Primary\r\n    public DataSource dataSource(){\r\n        return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean(name =

}\r\n\r\nNote that I have `@Bean(name=&quot;datasource1&quot;)` and `@Bean(name=&quot;datasource2&quot;)`, then you can use it when we need datasource as `@Qualifier(&quot;datasource1&quot;)` and `@Qualifier(&quot;datasource2&quot;)` , for example \r\n\r\n    @Qualifier(&quot;datasource1&quot;)\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    private DataSource dataSource;\r\n\r\nIf you do care about transaction, you have to define DataSourceTransactionManager for both of them, like this:\r\n\r\n    @Bean(name=&quot;tm1&quot;)\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    @Primary\r\n    DataSourceTransactionManager tm1(@Qualifier (&quot;datasource1&quot;) DataSource datasource) {\r\n        DataSourceTransactionManager txm  = new DataSourceTransactionManager(datasource);\r\n        return txm;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean(name=&quot;tm2&quot;)\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    DataSourceTransactionManager tm2(@Qualifier (&quot;datasource2&quot;) DataSource datasource) {\r\n        DataSourceTransactionManager txm  = new DataSourceTransactionManager(datasource);\r\n        return txm;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen you can use it like\r\n\r\n    @Transactional //this will use the first datasource because it is @primary\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    @Transactional(&quot;tm2&quot;)\r\n\r\n**The most important part, which you will hardly find an example in anywhere**: if you want a method to commit/rollback transactions of both databases, you need ChainedTransactionManager for tm1 and tm2 , like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    @Bean(name = &quot;chainedTransactionManager&quot;)\r\n    public ChainedTransactionManager getChainedTransactionManager(@Qualifier (&quot;tm1&quot;) DataSourceTransactionManager tm1, @Qualifier (&quot;tm2&quot;) DataSourceTransactionManager tm2){\r\n        return new ChainedTransactionManager(tm1, tm2);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nTo use it, add this annotation in a method @Transactional(value=&quot;chainedTransactionManager&quot;) for example\r\n\r\n\r\n    @Transactional(value=&quot;chainedTransactionManager&quot;)\r\n    public void insertAll() {\r\n        UserBean test = new UserBean();\r\n        test.setUsername(&quot;username&quot; + new Date().getTime());\r\n        userDao.insert(test);\r\n\r\n        userDao2.insert(test);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThis should be enough.

Between Chrome versions 96 &amp; 108 it was `--headless=chrome` and Chrome version 109 onwards it&#39;s `--headless=new`\r\n\r\n&gt;Note: [What are the two headless modes?](https://www.selenium.dev/blog/2023/headless-is-going-away/#what-are-the-two-headless-modes)\r\n\r\n- _`--nogpu`_ and _`--disable-gpu`_ arguments have no more revelance in the modern day Chrome browser. So you can drop them.\r\n- Modern day browser clients won&#39;t function properly without Javascript and it&#39;s a mandatory requirement. So you need to drop _`--enable-javascript`_.\r\n- _`--no-sandbox`_ isn&#39;t required unless you are facing issues executing your test as a root/admin user of the system and can be dropped.\r\n- _`--disable-extensions`_ and _`disable-infobars`_ arguments have no more revalance. So you can drop them.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n[Network Service](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/services/network/README.md)\r\n---------------\r\nThere are some services for networking. Those are meant to be oblivious to Chrome&#39;s features.\r\n\r\n&gt; - this only contains features that go over the network. e.g. no file loading, data URLs etc...\r\n&gt; - only the lowest-level of networking should be here. e.g. http, sockets, web sockets. Anything that is built on top of this should be\r\n&gt; in higher layers.\r\n&gt; - higher level web platform and browser features should be built outside of this code. Safe browsing, Service Worker, extensions,\r\n&gt; devtools etc... should not have hooks here. The only exception is when\r\n&gt; it&#39;s impossible for these features to function without some hooks in\r\n&gt; the network service. In that case, we add the minimal code required.\r\n&gt; Some examples included traffic shaping for devtools, CORB blocking,\r\n&gt; and CORS.\r\n&gt; - every PostTask, thread hop and process hop (IPC) should be counted carefully as they introduce delays which could harm this performance\r\n&gt; critical code.\r\n&gt; - `NetworkContext` and `NetworkService` are trusted interfaces that aren&#39;t meant to be sent to the renderer. Only the browser should have\r\n&gt; access to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nThis usecase\r\n------------\r\n_`NetworkService`_ and _`NetworkServiceInProcess`_ are two important configuration and you shouldn&#39;t disable them. So you need to remove the argument:\r\n\r\n\t&quot;--disable-features=NetworkService,NetworkServiceInProcess&quot;\r\n\t\r\nIncorporating the above suggestions execute your testcase, you should be good to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\ntl; dr\r\n------\r\nSome useful documentations:\r\n\r\n- [Network Service in Chrome](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wAHLw9h7gGuqJNCgG1mP1BmLtCGfZ2pys-PdZQ1vg7M/edit?pref=2&amp;pli=1#heading=h.7001qjw7yymp)\r\n- [Issue 598073: Content Modularization Project: Network Service](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=598073)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate\r\n------\r\nAs per your [comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76523188/dynamic-js-content-not-loading-when-testing-with-selenium-and-google-chrome-head/76544118#comment135015444_76544118) update that you still cannot see any of the dynamic content being loaded even after inducing [WebDriverWait](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48990165/7429447) can be due to one of the numerous reasons as below:\r\n\r\n- The browser is transferring the control to the WebDriver even before [`document.readyState` as **`complete`**](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60060481/7429447) is achieved.

Someone else uses your uber JAR in their application, `Bar`\r\n1. The `Bar` application has its own dependency on `Foo` but on v1.2.0 of that library. \r\n\r\nNow, if there is any clash between versions 1.0.0 and 1.2.0 of `Foo` we may have a problem because the owner of `Bar` cannot rely on which one will be loaded so either their code will misbehave or your code - when running within their application - will misbehave.\r\n\r\nShading helps to avoid issues such as this and also allows the provider of `Foo` to be explicit about the versions of the dependent libraries it uses.\r\n\r\nThe `maven-shade-plugin` allows you to (a) create an uber JAR and (b) to shade its contents.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\nCreating an uber JAR is a useful technique for simplifying your deployment process.\r\n\r\nShading is an extension to the uber JAR idea which is typically limited to use cases where \r\n\r\n- The JAR is a library to be used inside another application/library\r\n- The authors of the JAR want to be sure that the dependencies used by the JAR are in their control\r\n- The authors of the JAR want to avoid &#39;version clash&#39; issues for any applications/libraries using the JAR ","title":"What is a shaded JAR file?

Shading helps to avoid any such issue by renaming the packages within the uber JAR.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You create an uber JAR which contains v1.0.0 of the <code>Foo</code> library.</li>\n<li>Someone else uses your uber JAR in their application, <code>Bar</code></li>\n<li>The <code>Bar</code> application has its own dependency on <code>Foo</code> but on v1.2.0 of that library.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, if there is any clash between versions 1.0.0 and 1.2.0 of <code>Foo</code> we may have a problem because the owner of <code>Bar</code> cannot rely on which one will be loaded so either their code will misbehave or your code - when running within their application - will misbehave.</p>\n<p>Shading helps to avoid issues such as this and also allows the provider of <code>Foo</code> to be explicit about the versions of the dependent libraries it uses.</p>\n<p>The <code>maven-shade-plugin</code> allows you to (a) create an uber JAR and (b) to shade its contents.</p>\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n<p>Creating an uber JAR is a useful technique for simplifying your deployment process.</p>\n<p>Shading is an extension to the uber JAR idea which is typically limited to use cases where</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The JAR is a library to be used inside another application/library</li>\n<li>The authors of the JAR want to be sure that the dependencies used by the JAR are in their control</li>\n<li>The authors of the JAR want to avoid 'version clash' issues for any applications/libraries using the JAR</li>\n</ul>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":4251899,"reputation":853,"user_id":3478709,"display_name":"user3478709"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48382,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":85,"closed_date":1523629966,"accepted_answer_id":49811665,"answer_count":1,"score":84,"last_activity_date":1688063386,"creation_date":1523600871,"question_id":49810578,"body_markdown":"What is a shaded [JAR][1] file and how is the `maven-shade-plugin` useful?
