For example, if a file\r\n&gt; deletion failed, the program would receive a &quot;delete fail&quot; but\r\n&gt; wouldn&#39;t know if it was because the file didn&#39;t exist, the user didn&#39;t\r\n&gt; have permissions, or there was some other problem.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The rename method didn&#39;t work consistently across platforms.

must call the Fallback class in which the call to **service-three** is indicated and instead of *&quot;Get String from SERVICE-TWO&quot;*, the **client** should get *&quot;Get String from SERVICE-THREE&quot;* from **service-three.**\r\n\r\n**Service-two** and **service-three** are the same, only return different strings.\r\n\r\n***Service-one code:***\r\n\r\n    @RestController\r\n

[documentation](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html#AutomaticConfiguration)). Therefore you **can not** use the JDBC appender in your `log4j2.xml` file.\r\n * after the event is fired a reconfiguration is triggered, which uses `log4j2-spring.xml` if available. In this configuration file you **can** use Spring&#39;s environment thanks to the [Spring Lookup](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/log4j-spring-boot.html#spring-lookup).\r\n\r\nWhat you are attempting to do can be done in a `log4j2-spring.xml` configuration file with an appender definition like this:\r\n\r\n```lang-xml\r\n&lt;JDBC name=&quot;databaseAppender&quot; tableName=&quot;LOG_TABLE&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;DriverManager connectionString=&quot;${spring:spring.datasource.url}&quot;\r\n                 driverClassName=&quot;${spring:spring.datasource.driver-class-name}&quot;\r\n                 userName=&quot;${spring:spring.datasource.username}&quot;\r\n                 password=&quot;${spring:spring.datasource.password}&quot;/&gt;\r\n  &lt;Column name=&quot;LOG_LEVEL&quot; isUnicode=&quot;false&quot; pattern=&quot;%level&quot;/&gt;\r\n  &lt;Column name=&quot;CLASS_NAME&quot; isUnicode=&quot;false&quot; pattern=&quot;%C&quot;/&gt;\r\n  &lt;Column name=&quot;METHOD_NAME&quot; isUnicode=&quot;false&quot; pattern=&quot;%M&quot;/&gt;\r\n  &lt;Column name=&quot;LINE_NUMBER&quot; isUnicode=&quot;false&quot; pattern=&quot;%L&quot;/&gt;\r\n  &lt;Column name=&quot;MESSAGE&quot; isUnicode=&quot;false&quot; pattern=&quot;%m&quot;/&gt;\r\n  &lt;Column name=&quot;THREAD_NAME&quot; isUnicode=&quot;false&quot; pattern=&quot;%t&quot;/&gt;\r\n  &lt;Column name=&quot;TIMESTAMP&quot; isUnicode=&quot;false&quot; pattern=&quot;%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS}&quot;/&gt;\r\n&lt;/JDBC&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Dependencies configuration\r\n\r\nYou need to upgrade `log4j-core`, since the version you are using has multiple security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nSpring Boot is very opinionated about artifact versions: since you are using `spring-boot-starter-parent` you have more than a hundred [managed dependencies](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#dependency-management). IMHO the general rule about Spring Boot dependencies is:\r\n\r\n * don&#39;t override a version (don&#39;t provide a `&lt;version&gt;` property) if Spring Boot manages it. In your POM only `disruptor` is **not** managed by Spring Boot,\r\n * don&#39;t use a direct dependency if there is a starter for it. For Log4j 2.x Core Spring Boot provides [`spring-boot-starter-log4j2`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-log4j2).\r\n\r\nTherefore your Maven dependencies should look like:\r\n\r\n```lang-xml\r\n&lt;dependencies&gt;\r\n  &lt;!-- Replace if you are using a different logging API --&gt;\r\n  &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.logging.log4j&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;log4j-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n  &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n  &lt;!--\r\n    ~ These are not used directly in your code, hence the `runtime` scope.\r\n    --&gt;\r\n  &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-log4j2&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n  &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n  &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n    &lt;groupId&gt;com.oracle.database.jdbc&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;ojdbc8&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n  &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n  &lt;!-- Not managed by Spring Boot --&gt;\r\n  &lt;!-- Version suggested by `log4j-core` 2.20.0 --&gt;\r\n  &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n    &lt;groupId&gt;com.lmax&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;disruptor&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    &lt;version&gt;3.4.4&lt;/version&gt;\r\n    &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n  &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n  &lt;!-- Contains Spring Lookup --&gt;\r\n  &lt;!-- Not required any more in Spring Boot 3.x --&gt;\r\n  &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.logging.log4j&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;log4j-spring-boot&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n  &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n&lt;/dependencies&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\n\r\n**Remark:** you don&#39;t need LMAX `disruptor` to use asynchronous **appenders**. You would need it for asynchronous **loggers**. Asynchronous loggers give you a considerable performance bust (cf. [benchmark](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/async.html#asynchronous-logging-performance)), but asynchronous loggers + asynchronous appender will probably slow down to the performance of an asynchronous appender.","title":"Asynchronously Log4j2 JDBC Appender &quot;Unable to write to database&quot;","body":"<p>Spring will inject the <code>@Value</code> annotated fields only in beans <strong>managed</strong> by Spring (it means created and destroyed by Spring).

Realistically, you could use a `ComponentListener` and when `componentResized` is called, invalidate the cache, but this is an additional enhancement you could investigate yourself.\r\n* The time between spawning a new target is randomly between 1-2 seconds, this could be tweaked to use milliseconds instead of seconds, but I&#39;m sure most users won&#39;t see the difference\r\n* A target has a random live span of between 2-7 seconds, feel free to modify it.\r\n\r\nThe example also demonstrates a simple way to detect when a target has been clicked, in the example above, it will simple cause the target to be filled in.\r\n\r\nI would also consider using seperate components for the game and game over screens, possibly switching between them using a [`CardLayout`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/card.html).  This reduces the complexity of the classes.","title":"How to spawn multiple circles in a 2d grid?

Realistically, you could use a <code>ComponentListener</code> and when <code>componentResized</code> is called, invalidate the cache, but this is an additional enhancement you could investigate yourself.</li>\n<li>The time between spawning a new target is randomly between 1-2 seconds, this could be tweaked to use milliseconds instead of seconds, but I'm sure most users won't see the difference</li>\n<li>A target has a random live span of between 2-7 seconds, feel free to modify it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The example also demonstrates a simple way to detect when a target has been clicked, in the example above, it will simple cause the target to be filled in.</p>\n<p>I would also consider using seperate components for the game and game over screens, possibly switching between them using a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/card.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>CardLayout</code></a>.

anyone please point me in the right direction?\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\nJust to add if I even try to create the index on ES via code i.e. \r\n```\r\nelasticsearchClient.indices().create(b -&gt; b.index(&quot;test&quot;));\r\n```\r\nI still get the error \r\n```\r\nUnexpected JSON event &#39;VALUE_NUMBER&#39; instead of &#39;[START_OBJECT, KEY_NAME]&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n** EDIT 2**\r\nOk I&#39;ve narrowed down the issue. If I run ES locally things work. However its when I set the ES host to my instance running in Elastic.co that triggers the error.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve confirmed the username and password.

They may have been expecting more of a practical approach.\r\n\r\nBut after your explanation you could add these lines with a slightly different approach.  \r\n\r\n 1. Interfaces are rules (rules because you must give an implementation to them that you can&#39;t ignore or avoid, so that they are imposed like rules) which works as a common understanding document among various teams in software development. \r\n\r\n 2. Interfaces give the idea what is to be done but not how it will be done. So implementation completely depends on developer by following the given rules (means given signature of methods). \r\n\r\n 3. Abstract classes may contain abstract declarations, concrete implementations, or both.\r\n\r\n 4.

Important points about java interface static method:\r\n\r\n1.4 Java Functional Interfaces\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1.1.1. Abstract classes versus interfaces in Java 8\r\n---\r\n\r\n&gt; Java 8 interface changes include static methods and default methods in\r\n&gt; interfaces. Prior to Java 8, we could have only method declarations in\r\n&gt; the interfaces. But from Java 8, we can have default methods and\r\n&gt; static methods in the interfaces.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; After introducing Default Method, it seems that interfaces and\r\n&gt; abstract classes are same. However, they are still different concept\r\n&gt; in Java 8.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Abstract class can define constructor. They are more structured and\r\n&gt; can have a state associated with them. While in contrast, default\r\n&gt; method can be implemented only in the terms of invoking other\r\n&gt; interface methods, with no reference to a particular implementation&#39;s\r\n&gt; state. Hence, both use for different purposes and choosing between two\r\n&gt; really depends on the scenario context.\r\n\r\n1.1.2. Conceptual Difference:\r\n---\r\nAbstract classes are valid for skeletal (i.e. partial) implementations of interfaces but should not exist without a matching interface.\r\n\r\nSo when abstract classes are effectively reduced to be low-visibility, skeletal implementations of interfaces, can default methods take this away as well? Decidedly: No! Implementing interfaces almost always requires some or all of those class-building tools which default methods lack. And if some interface doesn’t, it is clearly a special case, which should not lead you astray.\r\n\r\n1.2 Interface Default Methods in Java 8\r\n---\r\n\r\nJava 8 introduces “[Default Method][1]” or (Defender methods) new feature, which allows developer to add new methods to the Interfaces without breaking the existing implementation of these Interface. It provides flexibility to allow Interface define implementation which will use as default in the situation where a concrete Class fails to provide an implementation for that method.\r\n\r\nLet consider small example to understand how it works:\r\n\r\n    public interface OldInterface {\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;public void existingMethod();\r\n    &#160;\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;default public void newDefaultMethod() {\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;System.out.println(&quot;New default method&quot;\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;+ &quot; is added in interface&quot;);\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe following Class will compile successfully in Java JDK 8,\r\n\r\n    public class OldInterfaceImpl implements OldInterface {\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;public void existingMethod() {\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;// existing implementation is here…\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf you create an instance of OldInterfaceImpl:\r\n\r\n    OldInterfaceImpl obj = new OldInterfaceImpl ();\r\n    // print “New default method add in interface”\r\n    obj.newDefaultMethod();&#160;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1.2.1. [Default Method:][2]\r\n---\r\n\r\n&gt; Default methods are never final, can not be synchronized and can not\r\n&gt; override Object’s methods. They are always public, which severely\r\n&gt; limits the ability to write short and reusable methods.\r\n\r\nDefault methods can be provided to an Interface without affecting implementing Classes as it includes an implementation. If each added method in an Interface defined with implementation then no implementing Class is affected. An implementing Class can override the default implementation provided by the Interface.\r\n\r\n&gt; Default methods enable to add new functionality to existing Interfaces\r\n&gt; without breaking older implementation of these Interfaces.\r\n\r\nWhen we extend an interface that contains a default method, we can perform following,\r\n\r\n 1. Not override the default method and will inherit the default method.\r\n 2. Override the default method similar to other methods we override in\r\n    subclass.\r\n 3. Redeclare default method as abstract, which force subclass to\r\n    override it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1.2.2. ForEach method compilation error solved using Default Method\r\n---\r\nFor Java 8, the JDK collections have been extended and forEach method is added to the entire collection (which work in conjunction with lambdas). With conventional way, the code looks like below,\r\n\r\n    public interface Iterable&lt;T&gt; {\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;public void forEach(Consumer&lt;? super T&gt; consumer);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSince this result each implementing Class with compile errors therefore, a default method added with a required implementation in order that the existing implementation should not be changed.\r\n\r\nThe Iterable Interface with the Default method is below,\r\n\r\n    public interface Iterable&lt;T&gt; {\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;public default void forEach(Consumer\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&lt;? super T&gt; consumer) {\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;for (T t : this) {\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;consumer.accept(t);\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;}\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;}\r\n    }\r\nThe same mechanism has been used to add [Stream][3] in JDK Interface without breaking the implementing Classes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1.2.3. Default Method and Multiple Inheritance Ambiguity Problems\r\n---\r\nSince java Class can implement multiple Interfaces and each Interface can define default method with same method signature, therefore, the inherited methods can conflict with each other.\r\n\r\nConsider below example,\r\n\r\n    public interface InterfaceA {&#160; \r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;default void defaultMethod(){&#160; \r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;System.out.println(&quot;Interface A default method&quot;);&#160; \r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;}&#160; \r\n    }\r\n    &#160;\r\n    public interface InterfaceB {\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;default void defaultMethod(){\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;System.out.println(&quot;Interface B default method&quot;);\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;}\r\n    }\r\n    &#160;\r\n    public class Impl implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB&#160; {\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe above code will fail to compile with the following error,\r\n\r\n&gt; java: class Impl inherits unrelated defaults for defaultMethod() from\r\n&gt; types InterfaceA and InterfaceB\r\n\r\nIn order to fix this class, we need to provide default method implementation:\r\n\r\n    public class Impl implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB {\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;public void defaultMethod(){\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFurther, if we want to invoke default implementation provided by any of super Interface rather than our own implementation, we can do so as follows,\r\n\r\n    public class Impl implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB {\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;public void defaultMethod(){\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;// existing code here..\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;InterfaceA.super.defaultMethod();\r\n    &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWe can choose any default implementation or both as part of our new method.\r\n\r\n1.2.4. Important points about java interface default methods:\r\n---\r\n1. Java interface default methods will help us in extending interfaces without having the fear of breaking implementation classes.\r\n2. Java interface default methods have bridge down the differences between interfaces and abstract classes.\r\n3. Java 8 interface default methods will help us in avoiding utility classes, such as all the Collections class method can be provided in the interfaces itself.\r\n4. Java interface default methods will help us in removing base implementation classes, we can provide default implementation and the implementation classes can chose which one to override.\r\n5. One of the major reason for introducing default methods in interfaces is to enhance the Collections API in Java 8 to support lambda expressions.\r\n6. If any class in the hierarchy has a method with same signature, then default methods become irrelevant. A default method cannot override a method from java.lang.Object. The reasoning is very simple, it’s because Object is the base class for all the java classes. So even if we have Object class methods defined as default methods in interfaces, it will be useless because Object class method will always be used. That’s why to avoid confusion, we can’t have default methods that are overriding Object class methods.\r\n7. Java interface default methods are also referred to as Defender Methods or Virtual extension methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nResource Link:\r\n---\r\n\r\n 1. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19998454/interface-with-default-methods-vs-abstract-class-in-java-8\r\n 2. [Abstract class versus interface in the JDK 8 era][4]\r\n 3. [Interface evolution via virtual extension methods][5]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1.3 Java Interface Static Method\r\n---\r\n\r\n**1.3.1. Java Interface Static Method, code example, static method vs default method**\r\n\r\nJava interface static method is similar to default method except that we can’t override them in the implementation classes. This feature helps us in avoiding undesired results incase of poor implementation in implementation classes. Let’s look into this with a simple example.\r\n\r\n\r\n    public interface MyData {\r\n    \r\n    \tdefault void print(String str) {\r\n    \t\tif (!isNull(str))\r\n    \t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;MyData Print::&quot; + str);\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tstatic boolean isNull(String str) {\r\n    \t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Interface Null Check&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    \t\treturn str == null ? true : &quot;&quot;.equals(str) ? true : false;\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow let’s see an implementation class that is having isNull() method with poor implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    public class MyDataImpl implements MyData {\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic boolean isNull(String str) {\r\n    \t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Impl Null Check&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    \t\treturn str == null ? true : false;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \tpublic static void main(String args[]){\r\n    \t\tMyDataImpl obj = new MyDataImpl();\r\n    \t\tobj.print(&quot;&quot;);\r\n    \t\tobj.isNull(&quot;abc&quot;);\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote that isNull(String str) is a simple class method, it’s not overriding the interface method. For example, if we will add @Override annotation to the isNull() method, it will result in compiler error.\r\n\r\nNow when we will run the application, we get following output.\r\n\r\n&gt; Interface Null Check\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Impl Null Check\r\n\r\nIf we make the interface method from static to default, we will get following output.\r\n\r\n&gt; Impl Null Check\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; MyData Print::\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Impl Null Check\r\n\r\nJava interface static method is visible to interface methods only, if we remove the isNull() method from the MyDataImpl class, we won’t be able to use it for the MyDataImpl object. However like other static methods, we can use interface static methods using class name. For example, a valid statement will be:\r\n\r\n    boolean result = MyData.isNull(&quot;abc&quot;);\r\n\r\n1.3.2. Important points about java interface static method:\r\n---\r\n1. Java interface static method is part of interface, we can’t use it for implementation class objects.\r\n2. Java interface static methods are good for providing utility methods, for example null check, collection sorting etc.\r\n3. Java interface static method helps us in providing security by not allowing implementation classes to override them.\r\n4. We can’t define interface static method for Object class methods, we will get compiler error as “This static method cannot hide the instance method from Object”. This is because it’s not allowed in java, since Object is the base class for all the classes and we can’t have one class level static method and another instance method with same signature.\r\n5. We can use java interface static methods to remove utility classes such as Collections and move all of it’s static methods to the corresponding interface, that would be easy to find and use.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1.4 Java Functional Interfaces\r\n---\r\nBefore I conclude the post, I would like to provide a brief introduction to Functional interfaces. An interface with exactly one abstract method is known as Functional Interface.\r\n\r\nA new annotation `@FunctionalInterface` has been introduced to mark an interface as Functional Interface. `@FunctionalInterface` annotation is a facility to avoid accidental addition of abstract methods in the functional interfaces. It’s optional but good practice to use it.\r\n\r\nFunctional interfaces are long awaited and much sought out feature of Java 8 because it enables us to use lambda expressions to instantiate them. A new package java.util.function with bunch of functional interfaces are added to provide target types for lambda expressions and method references. We will look into functional interfaces and lambda expressions in the future posts.\r\n\r\nResource Location:\r\n---\r\n\r\n 1.

Hence, both use for different purposes and choosing between two\nreally depends on the scenario context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>1.1.2. Conceptual Difference:</h2>\n<p>Abstract classes are valid for skeletal (i.e. partial) implementations of interfaces but should not exist without a matching interface.</p>\n<p>So when abstract classes are effectively reduced to be low-visibility, skeletal implementations of interfaces, can default methods take this away as well? Decidedly: No! Implementing interfaces almost always requires some or all of those class-building tools which default methods lack. And if some interface doesn’t, it is clearly a special case, which should not lead you astray.</p>\n<h2>1.2 Interface Default Methods in Java 8</h2>\n<p>Java 8 introduces “<a href=\"http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/java-8-explained-default-methods/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Default Method</a>” or (Defender methods) new feature, which allows developer to add new methods to the Interfaces without breaking the existing implementation of these Interface. It provides flexibility to allow Interface define implementation which will use as default in the situation where a concrete Class fails to provide an implementation for that method.</p>\n<p>Let consider small example to understand how it works:</p>\n<pre><code>public interface OldInterface {\n    public void existingMethod();\n \n    default public void newDefaultMethod() {\n        System.out.println(&quot;New default method&quot;\n               + &quot; is added in interface&quot;);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The following Class will compile successfully in Java JDK 8,</p>\n<pre><code>public class OldInterfaceImpl implements OldInterface {\n    public void existingMethod() {\n     // existing implementation is here…\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you create an instance of OldInterfaceImpl:</p>\n<pre><code>OldInterfaceImpl obj = new OldInterfaceImpl ();\n// print “New default method add in interface”\nobj.newDefaultMethod(); \n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<h2>1.2.1. <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Default Method:</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Default methods are never final, can not be synchronized and can not\noverride Object’s methods. They are always public, which severely\nlimits the ability to write short and reusable methods.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Default methods can be provided to an Interface without affecting implementing Classes as it includes an implementation. If each added method in an Interface defined with implementation then no implementing Class is affected. An implementing Class can override the default implementation provided by the Interface.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Default methods enable to add new functionality to existing Interfaces\nwithout breaking older implementation of these Interfaces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When we extend an interface that contains a default method, we can perform following,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Not override the default method and will inherit the default method.</li>\n<li>Override the default method similar to other methods we override in\nsubclass.</li>\n<li>Redeclare default method as abstract, which force subclass to\noverride it.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<h2>1.2.2. ForEach method compilation error solved using Default Method</h2>\n<p>For Java 8, the JDK collections have been extended and forEach method is added to the entire collection (which work in conjunction with lambdas). With conventional way, the code looks like below,</p>\n<pre><code>public interface Iterable&lt;T&gt; {\n    public void forEach(Consumer&lt;? super T&gt; consumer);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since this result each implementing Class with compile errors therefore, a default method added with a required implementation in order that the existing implementation should not be changed.</p>\n<p>The Iterable Interface with the Default method is below,</p>\n<pre><code>public interface Iterable&lt;T&gt; {\n    public default void forEach(Consumer\n                   &lt;? super T&gt; consumer) {\n        for (T t : this) {\n            consumer.accept(t);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The same mechanism has been used to add <a href=\"http://download.java.net/jdk8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Stream</a> in JDK Interface without breaking the implementing Classes.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>1.2.3. Default Method and Multiple Inheritance Ambiguity Problems</h2>\n<p>Since java Class can implement multiple Interfaces and each Interface can define default method with same method signature, therefore, the inherited methods can conflict with each other.</p>\n<p>Consider below example,</p>\n<pre><code>public interface InterfaceA {  \n       default void defaultMethod(){  \n           System.out.println(&quot;Interface A default method&quot;);  \n    }  \n}\n \npublic interface InterfaceB {\n   default void defaultMethod(){\n       System.out.println(&quot;Interface B default method&quot;);\n   }\n}\n \npublic class Impl implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB  {\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above code will fail to compile with the following error,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>java: class Impl inherits unrelated defaults for defaultMethod() from\ntypes InterfaceA and InterfaceB</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In order to fix this class, we need to provide default method implementation:</p>\n<pre><code>public class Impl implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB {\n    public void defaultMethod(){\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Further, if we want to invoke default implementation provided by any of super Interface rather than our own implementation, we can do so as follows,</p>\n<pre><code>public class Impl implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB {\n    public void defaultMethod(){\n        // existing code here..\n        InterfaceA.super.defaultMethod();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can choose any default implementation or both as part of our new method.</p>\n<h2>1.2.4. Important points about java interface default methods:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Java interface default methods will help us in extending interfaces without having the fear of breaking implementation classes.</li>\n<li>Java interface default methods have bridge down the differences between interfaces and abstract classes.</li>\n<li>Java 8 interface default methods will help us in avoiding utility classes, such as all the Collections class method can be provided in the interfaces itself.</li>\n<li>Java interface default methods will help us in removing base implementation classes, we can provide default implementation and the implementation classes can chose which one to override.</li>\n<li>One of the major reason for introducing default methods in interfaces is to enhance the Collections API in Java 8 to support lambda expressions.</li>\n<li>If any class in the hierarchy has a method with same signature, then default methods become irrelevant. A default method cannot override a method from java.lang.Object. The reasoning is very simple, it’s because Object is the base class for all the java classes. So even if we have Object class methods defined as default methods in interfaces, it will be useless because Object class method will always be used. That’s why to avoid confusion, we can’t have default methods that are overriding Object class methods.</li>\n<li>Java interface default methods are also referred to as Defender Methods or Virtual extension methods.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Resource Link:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19998454/interface-with-default-methods-vs-abstract-class-in-java-8\">When to use: Java 8+ interface default method, vs. abstract method</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.javaworld.com/article/2139921/learn-java/abstract-class-versus-interface-in-the-jdk-8-era.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Abstract class versus interface in the JDK 8 era</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://cr.openjdk.java.net/%7Ebriangoetz/lambda/Defender%20Methods%20v4.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Interface evolution via virtual extension methods</a></li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<h2>1.3 Java Interface Static Method</h2>\n<p><strong>1.3.1. Java Interface Static Method, code example, static method vs default method</strong></p>\n<p>Java interface static method is similar to default method except that we can’t override them in the implementation classes. This feature helps us in avoiding undesired results incase of poor implementation in implementation classes. Let’s look into this with a simple example.</p>\n<pre><code>public interface MyData {\n\n    default void print(String str) {\n        if (!isNull(str))\n            System.out.println(&quot;MyData Print::&quot; + str);\n    }\n\n    static boolean isNull(String str) {\n        System.out.println(&quot;Interface Null Check&quot;);\n\n        return str == null ? true : &quot;&quot;.equals(str) ? true : false;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now let’s see an implementation class that is having isNull() method with poor implementation.</p>\n<pre><code>public class MyDataImpl implements MyData {\n\n    public boolean isNull(String str) {\n        System.out.println(&quot;Impl Null Check&quot;);\n\n        return str == null ? true : false;\n    }\n    \n    public static void main(String args[]){\n        MyDataImpl obj = new MyDataImpl();\n        obj.print(&quot;&quot;);\n        obj.isNull(&quot;abc&quot;);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that isNull(String str) is a simple class method, it’s not overriding the interface method. For example, if we will add @Override annotation to the isNull() method, it will result in compiler error.</p>\n<p>Now when we will run the application, we get following output.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Interface Null Check</p>\n<p>Impl Null Check</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we make the interface method from static to default, we will get following output.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Impl Null Check</p>\n<p>MyData Print::</p>\n<p>Impl Null Check</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Java interface static method is visible to interface methods only, if we remove the isNull() method from the MyDataImpl class, we won’t be able to use it for the MyDataImpl object. However like other static methods, we can use interface static methods using class name. For example, a valid statement will be:</p>\n<pre><code>boolean result = MyData.isNull(&quot;abc&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<h2>1.3.2. Important points about java interface static method:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Java interface static method is part of interface, we can’t use it for implementation class objects.</li>\n<li>Java interface static methods are good for providing utility methods, for example null check, collection sorting etc.</li>\n<li>Java interface static method helps us in providing security by not allowing implementation classes to override them.</li>\n<li>We can’t define interface static method for Object class methods, we will get compiler error as “This static method cannot hide the instance method from Object”. This is because it’s not allowed in java, since Object is the base class for all the classes and we can’t have one class level static method and another instance method with same signature.</li>\n<li>We can use java interface static methods to remove utility classes such as Collections and move all of it’s static methods to the corresponding interface, that would be easy to find and use.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<h2>1.4 Java Functional Interfaces</h2>\n<p>Before I conclude the post, I would like to provide a brief introduction to Functional interfaces. An interface with exactly one abstract method is known as Functional Interface.</p>\n<p>A new annotation <code>@FunctionalInterface</code> has been introduced to mark an interface as Functional Interface. <code>@FunctionalInterface</code> annotation is a facility to avoid accidental addition of abstract methods in the functional interfaces. It’s optional but good practice to use it.</p>\n<p>Functional interfaces are long awaited and much sought out feature of Java 8 because it enables us to use lambda expressions to instantiate them. A new package java.util.function with bunch of functional interfaces are added to provide target types for lambda expressions and method references. We will look into functional interfaces and lambda expressions in the future posts.</p>\n<h2>Resource Location:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.journaldev.com/2752/java-8-interface-changes-static-method-default-method\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Java 8 Interface Changes – static method, default method</a></li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4407875,"reputation":475,"user_id":3591707,"display_name":"Teto"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1466137708,"creation_date":1466136929,"answer_id":37873028,"question_id":18777989,"body_markdown":"**When I am trying to share behavior between 2 closely related classes, I create an abstract class that holds the common behavior and serves as a parent to both classes.**\r\n\r\n**When I am trying to define a Type, a list of methods that a user of my object can reliably call upon, then I create an interface.**  \r\n\r\nFor example, I would never create an abstract class with 1 concrete subclass because abstract classes are about sharing behavior.

When you write code for yourself, by yourself, you rarely think of other present or future developers working on or with your code.\r\n\r\nInterfaces and abstract classes, although apparently similar from a technical point of view, have completely different meanings and purposes.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n1. An interface **defines a contract** that some implementation will fulfill *for you*.\r\n\r\n2.

Read on for more details.\r\n\r\n## Alternative summary\r\n\r\n1. An interface is for defining public APIs\r\n2. An abstract class is for internal use, and for defining SPIs\r\n\r\n### By example ###\r\n\r\nTo put it differently: A concrete class does the actual work, in a very specific way. For example, an `ArrayList` uses a contiguous area of memory to store a list of objects in a compact manner which offers fast random access, iteration, and in-place changes, but is terrible at insertions, deletions, and occasionally even additions; meanwhile, a `LinkedList` uses double-linked nodes to store a list of objects, which instead offers fast iteration, in-place changes, and insertion/deletion/addition, but is terrible at random access. These two types of lists are optimized for different use cases, and it matters a lot how you&#39;re going to use them. When you&#39;re trying to squeeze performance out of a list that you&#39;re heavily interacting with, and when picking the type of list is up to you, you should carefully pick which one you&#39;re instantiating.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, high level users of a list don&#39;t really care how it is actually implemented, and they should be insulated from these details. Let&#39;s imagine that Java didn&#39;t expose the `List` interface, but only had a concrete `List` class that&#39;s actually what `LinkedList` is right now. All Java developers would have tailored their code to fit the implementation details: avoid random access, add a cache to speed up access, or just reimplement `ArrayList` on their own, although it would be incompatible with all the other code that actually works with `List` only. That would be terrible... But now imagine that the Java masters actually realize that a linked list is terrible for most actual use cases, and decided to switch over to an array list for their only `List` class available. This would affect the performance of every Java program in the world, and people wouldn&#39;t be happy about it. And the main culprit is that implementation details were available, and the developers assumed that those details are a permanent contract that they can rely on. This is why it&#39;s important to hide implementation details, and only define an abstract contract. This is the purpose of an interface: define what kind of input a method accepts, and what kind of output is expected, without exposing all the guts that would tempt programmers to tweak their code to fit the internal details that might change with any future update.\r\n\r\nAn abstract class is in the middle between interfaces and concrete classes. It is supposed to help implementations share common or boring code. For example, `AbstractCollection` provides basic implementations for `isEmpty` based on size is 0, `contains` as iterate and compare, `addAll` as repeated `add`, and so on. This lets implementations focus on the crucial parts that differentiate between them: how to actually store and retrieve data.\r\n\r\n### Another perspective: APIs versus SPIs\r\n\r\nInterfaces are low-cohesion **gateways** between different parts of code. They allow libraries to exist and evolve without breaking every library user when something changes internally. It&#39;s called *Application Programming **Interface***, not Application Programming Classes. On a smaller scale, they also allow multiple developers to collaborate successfully on large scale projects, by separating different modules through well documented interfaces.\r\n\r\nAbstract classes are high-cohesion **helpers** to be used when implementing an interface, assuming some level of implementation details. Alternatively, abstract classes are used for defining SPIs, Service Provider Interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe difference between an API and an SPI is subtle, but important: for an API, the focus is on who **uses** it, and for an SPI the focus is on who **implements** it.\r\n\r\nAdding methods to an API is easy, all existing users of the API will still compile. Adding methods to an SPI is hard, since every service provider (concrete implementation) will have to implement the new methods. If interfaces are used to define an SPI, a provider will have to release a new version whenever the SPI contract changes. If abstract classes are used instead, new methods could either be defined in terms of existing abstract methods, or as empty `throw not implemented exception` stubs, which will at least allow an older version of a service implementation to still compile and run.\r\n\r\n### A note on Java 8 and default methods\r\n\r\nAlthough Java 8 introduced default methods for interfaces, which makes the line between interfaces and abstract classes even blurrier, this wasn&#39;t so that implementations can reuse code, but to make it easier to change interfaces that serve both as an API and as an SPI (or are wrongly used for defining SPIs instead of abstract classes).\r\n\r\n### &quot;Book knowledge&quot;\r\n\r\nThe technical details provided in the OP&#39;s answer are considered &quot;book knowledge&quot; because this is usually the approach used in school and in most technology books about a language: **what** a thing is, not **how** to use it in practice, especially in large scale applications.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an analogy: supposed the question was:\r\n\r\n&gt; What is better to rent for prom night, a car or a hotel room?\r\n\r\nThe technical answer sounds like:\r\n\r\n&gt; Well, in a car you can do it sooner, but in a hotel room you can do it more comfortably. On the other hand, the hotel room is in only one place, while in the car you can do it in more places, like, let&#39;s say you can go to the vista point for a nice view, or in a drive-in theater, or many other places, or even in more than one place. Also, the hotel room has a shower.\r\n\r\nThat is all true, but completely misses the points that they are two completely different things, and both can be used at the same time for different purposes, and the &quot;doing it&quot; aspect is not the most important thing about either of the two options. The answer lacks perspective, it shows an immature way of thinking, while correctly presenting true &quot;facts&quot;.","title":"How should I have explained the difference between an Interface and an Abstract class?","body":"<p>Many junior developers make the mistake of thinking of interfaces, abstract and concrete classes as slight variations of the same thing, and choose one of them purely on technical grounds: <em>Do I need multiple inheritance?

It is supposed to help implementations share common or boring code. For example, <code>AbstractCollection</code> provides basic implementations for <code>isEmpty</code> based on size is 0, <code>contains</code> as iterate and compare, <code>addAll</code> as repeated <code>add</code>, and so on. This lets implementations focus on the crucial parts that differentiate between them: how to actually store and retrieve data.</p>\n\n<h3>Another perspective: APIs versus SPIs</h3>\n\n<p>Interfaces are low-cohesion <strong>gateways</strong> between different parts of code. They allow libraries to exist and evolve without breaking every library user when something changes internally. It's called <em>Application Programming <strong>Interface</em></strong>, not Application Programming Classes. On a smaller scale, they also allow multiple developers to collaborate successfully on large scale projects, by separating different modules through well documented interfaces.</p>\n\n<p>Abstract classes are high-cohesion <strong>helpers</strong> to be used when implementing an interface, assuming some level of implementation details. Alternatively, abstract classes are used for defining SPIs, Service Provider Interfaces.</p>\n\n<p>The difference between an API and an SPI is subtle, but important: for an API, the focus is on who <strong>uses</strong> it, and for an SPI the focus is on who <strong>implements</strong> it.</p>\n\n<p>Adding methods to an API is easy, all existing users of the API will still compile. Adding methods to an SPI is hard, since every service provider (concrete implementation) will have to implement the new methods. If interfaces are used to define an SPI, a provider will have to release a new version whenever the SPI contract changes. If abstract classes are used instead, new methods could either be defined in terms of existing abstract methods, or as empty <code>throw not implemented exception</code> stubs, which will at least allow an older version of a service implementation to still compile and run.</p>\n\n<h3>A note on Java 8 and default methods</h3>\n\n<p>Although Java 8 introduced default methods for interfaces, which makes the line between interfaces and abstract classes even blurrier, this wasn't so that implementations can reuse code, but to make it easier to change interfaces that serve both as an API and as an SPI (or are wrongly used for defining SPIs instead of abstract classes).</p>\n\n<h3>\"Book knowledge\"</h3>\n\n<p>The technical details provided in the OP's answer are considered \"book knowledge\" because this is usually the approach used in school and in most technology books about a language: <strong>what</strong> a thing is, not <strong>how</strong> to use it in practice, especially in large scale applications.</p>\n\n<p>Here's an analogy: supposed the question was:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is better to rent for prom night, a car or a hotel room?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The technical answer sounds like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Well, in a car you can do it sooner, but in a hotel room you can do it more comfortably. On the other hand, the hotel room is in only one place, while in the car you can do it in more places, like, let's say you can go to the vista point for a nice view, or in a drive-in theater, or many other places, or even in more than one place. Also, the hotel room has a shower.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is all true, but completely misses the points that they are two completely different things, and both can be used at the same time for different purposes, and the \"doing it\" aspect is not the most important thing about either of the two options. The answer lacks perspective, it shows an immature way of thinking, while correctly presenting true \"facts\".</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3332416,"reputation":1146,"user_id":2801026,"display_name":"Jaxian"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1466351598,"creation_date":1466351598,"answer_id":37909057,"question_id":18777989,"body_markdown":"Yes, your responses were technically correct but where you went wrong was not showing them you understand the upsides and downsides of choosing one over the other.

An abstract class defines the core identity of its descendants. If you defined a Dog abstract class then Dalmatian descendants are Dogs, they are not merely dogable.\r\n\r\nPre Java 8, [@Daniel Lerps’s answer][5] was spot on, that interfaces are like a contract that the implementing class has to fulfil.\r\n\r\nNow, with default methods, they are more like a [Mixin][6], that still enforces a contract, but can also give code to do the work.  This has allowed interfaces to take over some of the use cases of abstract classes.\r\n\r\nThe point of an abstract class is that it has missing functionality, in the form of abstract methods. If a class doesn’t have any abstract behaviour (which changes between different types) then it could be a concrete class instead.\r\n\r\n## Abstract classes are classes\r\n\r\nHere are some of the normal features of classes which are available in abstract classes, but not in interfaces:\r\n\r\n - Instance variables / non-final variables.  And therefore…\r\n - Methods which can access and modify the state of the object \r\n - Private / protected members (but see note on Java 9)\r\n - Ability to extend abstract or concrete classes\r\n - Constructors\r\n\r\nPoints to note about abstract classes:\r\n\r\n - They cannot be `final` (because their whole purpose is to be extended)\r\n - An abstract class that extends another abstract class inherits all of its abstract methods as its own abstract methods\r\n\r\n## Abstract methods\r\n\r\nBoth abstract classes and interfaces can have zero to many abstract methods. Abstract methods:\r\n\r\n - Are method signatures without a body (i.e. no `{}`)\r\n - Must be marked with the `abstract` keyword in abstract classes. In interfaces this keyword is unnecessary\r\n - Cannot be `private` (because they need to be implemented by another class)\r\n - Cannot be `final` (because they don’t have bodies yet)\r\n - Cannot be `static` ([because reasons][2])\r\n\r\nNote also that:\r\n\r\n - Abstract methods can be called by non-abstract methods in the same class/interface \r\n - The first concrete class that extends an abstract class or implements an interface must provide an implementation for all the abstract methods\r\n\r\n## Static methods\r\n\r\nA static method on an abstract class can be called directly with `MyAbstractClass.method();` (i.e. just like for a normal class, and it can also be called via a class that extends the abstract class).\r\n\r\nInterfaces can also have static methods.  These can only be called via the name of the interface (`MyInterface.method();`).

An abstract class defines the core identity of its descendants. If you defined a Dog abstract class then Dalmatian descendants are Dogs, they are not merely dogable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Pre Java 8, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/18778228/1450420\">@Daniel Lerps’s answer</a> was spot on, that interfaces are like a contract that the implementing class has to fulfil.</p>\n\n<p>Now, with default methods, they are more like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mixin</a>, that still enforces a contract, but can also give code to do the work.  This has allowed interfaces to take over some of the use cases of abstract classes.</p>\n\n<p>The point of an abstract class is that it has missing functionality, in the form of abstract methods. If a class doesn’t have any abstract behaviour (which changes between different types) then it could be a concrete class instead.</p>\n\n<h2>Abstract classes are classes</h2>\n\n<p>Here are some of the normal features of classes which are available in abstract classes, but not in interfaces:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Instance variables / non-final variables.  And therefore…</li>\n<li>Methods which can access and modify the state of the object </li>\n<li>Private / protected members (but see note on Java 9)</li>\n<li>Ability to extend abstract or concrete classes</li>\n<li>Constructors</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Points to note about abstract classes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They cannot be <code>final</code> (because their whole purpose is to be extended)</li>\n<li>An abstract class that extends another abstract class inherits all of its abstract methods as its own abstract methods</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Abstract methods</h2>\n\n<p>Both abstract classes and interfaces can have zero to many abstract methods. Abstract methods:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Are method signatures without a body (i.e. no <code>{}</code>)</li>\n<li>Must be marked with the <code>abstract</code> keyword in abstract classes. In interfaces this keyword is unnecessary</li>\n<li>Cannot be <code>private</code> (because they need to be implemented by another class)</li>\n<li>Cannot be <code>final</code> (because they don’t have bodies yet)</li>\n<li>Cannot be <code>static</code> (<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/370962/\">because reasons</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note also that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Abstract methods can be called by non-abstract methods in the same class/interface </li>\n<li>The first concrete class that extends an abstract class or implements an interface must provide an implementation for all the abstract methods</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Static methods</h2>\n\n<p>A static method on an abstract class can be called directly with <code>MyAbstractClass.method();</code> (i.e. just like for a normal class, and it can also be called via a class that extends the abstract class).</p>\n\n<p>Interfaces can also have static methods.  These can only be called via the name of the interface (<code>MyInterface.method();</code>).  These methods:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Cannot be <code>abstract</code>, i.e. must have a body (see ‘because reasons’ above) </li>\n<li>Are not <code>default</code> (see below)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Default methods</h2>\n\n<p>Interfaces can have default methods which must have the <code>default</code> keyword and a method body.

As some other patterns that have not aged so well (factory method?) it implies more inheritance with abstract classes holding behavior than other patterns, hence is less generally applicable.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s mostly Strategy doing the big work, but a major issue with Strategy is that the strategy often needs knowledge about its context.\r\n\r\nIn some languages this leads to strategies being declared friend of the context, or strategies defined as internal classes in Java.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis means that the context often ends up with knowledge of existence of the various concrete strategies. You can avoid this by using a setStrategy() function, but the reverse dependency from concrete strategy to context usually survives, due to efficiency reasons (you want to manipulate the context&#39;s data structures directly).\r\n\r\nThis issue is kind of solved by Bridge, as the context of Strategy is now abstract, but still a class a priori, since it has at least the code for Strategy. It should usually define an access API sufficient for the concrete Strategies to work with, possibly with holes i.e. abstract methods. You put an occurrence of AbstractContext in the signature of the operations on AbstractStragey and you&#39;re good.\r\n\r\nSo in my point of view, Bridge completes Strategy by making the Context concrete enough for the strategies to work, but still abstract enough that it can be orthogonally refined w.r.t. concrete strategies (with feedback effects when implementing abstract API of the context that the concrete strategies actually use). \r\n\r\nA simpler way of seeing bridge is to say that the AbstractStrategy operations should always take abstractions as parameters rather than really knowing intimately their context. \r\n\r\nTo answer the OP question more precisely :\r\n&gt; what is meaning of this statement? Is implementation resides at in separate jar ?\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, typically you could define the Abstraction and Implementor in a package &quot;base&quot; (tey could be interfaces). The concrete Implementors can each reside in a package &quot;implXX&quot;. The concrete context can reside in separate packages &quot;contXX&quot;.

As some other patterns that have not aged so well (factory method?) it implies more inheritance with abstract classes holding behavior than other patterns, hence is less generally applicable.</p>\n\n<p>It's mostly Strategy doing the big work, but a major issue with Strategy is that the strategy often needs knowledge about its context.</p>\n\n<p>In some languages this leads to strategies being declared friend of the context, or strategies defined as internal classes in Java.</p>\n\n<p>This means that the context often ends up with knowledge of existence of the various concrete strategies. You can avoid this by using a setStrategy() function, but the reverse dependency from concrete strategy to context usually survives, due to efficiency reasons (you want to manipulate the context's data structures directly).</p>\n\n<p>This issue is kind of solved by Bridge, as the context of Strategy is now abstract, but still a class a priori, since it has at least the code for Strategy. It should usually define an access API sufficient for the concrete Strategies to work with, possibly with holes i.e. abstract methods. You put an occurrence of AbstractContext in the signature of the operations on AbstractStragey and you're good.</p>\n\n<p>So in my point of view, Bridge completes Strategy by making the Context concrete enough for the strategies to work, but still abstract enough that it can be orthogonally refined w.r.t. concrete strategies (with feedback effects when implementing abstract API of the context that the concrete strategies actually use). </p>\n\n<p>A simpler way of seeing bridge is to say that the AbstractStrategy operations should always take abstractions as parameters rather than really knowing intimately their context. </p>\n\n<p>To answer the OP question more precisely :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>what is meaning of this statement? Is implementation resides at in separate jar ?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, indeed, typically you could define the Abstraction and Implementor in a package \"base\" (tey could be interfaces). The concrete Implementors can each reside in a package \"implXX\". The concrete context can reside in separate packages \"contXX\". There are no cycles in the dependency graph, everybody depends on base, new \"contXX\" and \"implXX\" can be defined independently (no dependencies at all between them) thus the bold statement in the OP. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>what is meaning of vary independently statement ?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Think of an editor plugin in eclipse; it must handle the actions on buttons and clicks (like a strategy), but the actual action the strategy needs to do is act on the editor state itself (e.g. \"highlight text\").

Some of the issues:\r\n\r\n*  Every time a &quot;)&quot; is processed the `root` variable is overwritten with a new node -- so losing whatever was there before. \r\n\r\n* It cannot be right that you would have to create *two* nodes whenever a &quot;)&quot; is encountered. \r\n\r\n* `stack.lastElement()` may be executed on an empty stack...\r\n\r\n* By setting `parent.right = root;` you admit that `root` has a parent, so then `return root` is not returning the root.\r\n\r\n* `if (parent.left == null) {` might not be the right way to detect that the left child has to receive the new child. Consider that an input might have `A()(C)` to indicate that &quot;A&quot; has no left child, but does have a right child (C). You would need to somehow register that `()` was the input for the *left* child, keeping it `null`, while the next information would serve for a right child.\r\n\r\n* ...\r\n\r\nSome other remarks:\r\n\r\n* The `Node` class should not have a `root` member. Only the `BinaryTree` class should have that. \r\n\r\n* The `BinaryTree` class should not need `parent` (a tree has no parent), `c` (that should just be a local variable), `r` (?), nor even `tree` (as that is string input that should immediately be converted to the tree itself -- there is no need to persist that). So the only property a tree needs is its `root`.\r\n\r\n* `strToTree` should better return a new `BinaryTree` instance instead of a `Node`. So it should be a static method, or even better, a constructor for the class.\r\n\r\n* I don&#39;t see what you intended to do with the `inOrderTraverse` method you have on the `BinaryTree` class. It should just call the method with the same name on the `Node` class.\r\n\r\n* The `inOrderTraverse` method on the `Node` class should be static (it doesn&#39;t use the *current* node `this`).\r\n\r\n* Using a `Queue` is overkill. You can just iterate the characters of the input string.\r\n\r\n* To keep track of whether the next token in the input string is about a left or a right child, you could also stack a boolean for each node that is on the stack.
