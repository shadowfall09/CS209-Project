In fact, I&#39;m doing most of the manipulation using OpenCV, and I&#39;m using JNI to wrap around the OpenCV functions that I need. I am extremely satisfied with the performance OpenCV gives, the people who wrote the OpenCV code deserve great great credit for the code. In sharp contrast to what I experience with the code Java devs wrote.\r\n\r\nI started out optimistic over the choice of my programming language, my first working iteration of the project works fine, but its performance is nowhere near to realtime (getting about 1 frame per 2 seconds.) I&#39;ve done some optimizations of MY code and its helped a lot. I&#39;ve been able to push the frame rate up to about 10-20 frames per second, which is great, but what I&#39;m finding is that to do any further optimizations I have to rewrite Java code to do the same thing but 10-20x more efficient. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m appalled at how the developers of Java pay very little attention to performance, especially when writing the classes for Media related classes. I&#39;ve downloaded OpenJDK and I&#39;m exploring the functions I&#39;m using. For example, there is a function under the Raster class called getPixels(...) and it gets the pixels of the image. I was expecting this function to be a highly optimized function in the source code, with several calls to System.arrayCopy to further optimize performance. Instead what I found was extremely &quot;Classy&quot; code, where they are calling 5-6 different classes and 10-20 different methods just to accomplish what I can do in one line: \r\n\r\n    for (int i =0; i &lt; n; i++) {\r\n      long p = rawFrame[i];\r\n      p = (p &lt;&lt; 32) &gt;&gt;&gt; 32;\r\n      byte red = (byte) ((p &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xff);\r\n      byte green = (byte) ((p &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xff);\r\n      byte blue = (byte) ((p) &amp; 0xff);\r\n      byte val = (byte)(0.212671f * red + 0.715160f * green + 0.072169f * blue);\r\n      data[i] = val;\r\n      grayFrameData[i] = (val &amp; 0x80) + (val &amp; (0x7f)); \r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe code above transforms an image to grayscale and gets the float pixel data, in roughly 1-10ms. If I wanted to do the same with Java built in functions, the conversion to grayscale itself takes 200-300ms and then grabbing the float pixels takes about 50-100ms. This is unacceptable for real time performance. Note to get a speedup, I make heavy use of bitwise operators, which Java devs shy away from.\r\n\r\nI understand that they need to handle the general case, but even so, can&#39;t they at least give options for optimizations or at the very least a warning how slow this code may perform.  \r\n\r\nMy question is, at this late point in the development (I already have my first iteration, not I&#39;m working on a second that performs more in real time) should I bite the bullet and switch over to C/C++ where I can fine tune things a lot more, or should I stick with Java and hope things will become more realtime friendly so that I won&#39;t have to rewrite already implemented Java code to get a speedup.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m really beginning to become disgusted with how &quot;classy&quot; and slow Java really is. The amount of classes there are seems like overkill.","title":"Java Realtime Performance","body":"<p>I'm working with Java project that requires very advanced manipulations of images.

In sharp contrast to what I experience with the code Java devs wrote.</p>\n\n<p>I started out optimistic over the choice of my programming language, my first working iteration of the project works fine, but its performance is nowhere near to realtime (getting about 1 frame per 2 seconds.) I've done some optimizations of MY code and its helped a lot. I've been able to push the frame rate up to about 10-20 frames per second, which is great, but what I'm finding is that to do any further optimizations I have to rewrite Java code to do the same thing but 10-20x more efficient. </p>\n\n<p>I'm appalled at how the developers of Java pay very little attention to performance, especially when writing the classes for Media related classes. I've downloaded OpenJDK and I'm exploring the functions I'm using. For example, there is a function under the Raster class called getPixels(...) and it gets the pixels of the image. I was expecting this function to be a highly optimized function in the source code, with several calls to System.arrayCopy to further optimize performance. Instead what I found was extremely \"Classy\" code, where they are calling 5-6 different classes and 10-20 different methods just to accomplish what I can do in one line: </p>\n\n<pre><code>for (int i =0; i &lt; n; i++) {\n  long p = rawFrame[i];\n  p = (p &lt;&lt; 32) &gt;&gt;&gt; 32;\n  byte red = (byte) ((p &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xff);\n  byte green = (byte) ((p &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xff);\n  byte blue = (byte) ((p) &amp; 0xff);\n  byte val = (byte)(0.212671f * red + 0.715160f * green + 0.072169f * blue);\n  data[i] = val;\n  grayFrameData[i] = (val &amp; 0x80) + (val &amp; (0x7f)); \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The code above transforms an image to grayscale and gets the float pixel data, in roughly 1-10ms. If I wanted to do the same with Java built in functions, the conversion to grayscale itself takes 200-300ms and then grabbing the float pixels takes about 50-100ms. This is unacceptable for real time performance. Note to get a speedup, I make heavy use of bitwise operators, which Java devs shy away from.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that they need to handle the general case, but even so, can't they at least give options for optimizations or at the very least a warning how slow this code may perform.  </p>\n\n<p>My question is, at this late point in the development (I already have my first iteration, not I'm working on a second that performs more in real time) should I bite the bullet and switch over to C/C++ where I can fine tune things a lot more, or should I stick with Java and hope things will become more realtime friendly so that I won't have to rewrite already implemented Java code to get a speedup.</p>\n\n<p>I'm really beginning to become disgusted with how \"classy\" and slow Java really is. The amount of classes there are seems like overkill.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","string","loops","arraylist","char"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":319873,"reputation":87612,"user_id":637853,"accept_rate":50,"display_name":"Thomas"},"score":1,"creation_date":1667378219,"post_id":74286348,"comment_id":131150480,"body_markdown":"Well, you might want to get rid of that ` System.out.print()` in your main method since you&#39;re already printing in `GetNumber()` (btw, as per Java code conventions it should be `getNumber()` and from a design perspective the name is misleading).","body":"Well, you might want to get rid of that ` System.out.print()` in your main method since you&#39;re already printing in <code>GetNumber()</code> (btw, as per Java code conventions it should be <code>getNumber()</code> and from a design perspective the name is misleading)."},{"owner":{"account_id":23166977,"reputation":61,"user_id":17266758,"display_name":"Plus Ultra"},"score":0,"creation_date":1667378893,"post_id":74286348,"comment_id":131150708,"body_markdown":"It&#39;s a technical assessment test, they make it tricky","body":"It&#39;s a technical assessment test, they make it tricky"},{"owner":{"account_id":7612423,"reputation":82506,"user_id":5772882,"display_name":"Anonymous"},"score":0,"creation_date":1667379942,"post_id":74286348,"comment_id":131151085,"body_markdown":"`GetNumber` is the wrong name for your method.

It was overcrowded but somehow I managed to get into the bus. Some passengers were hanging on the footboard, so there was no question of getting a seat. It was very uncomfortable. We were feeling suffocated. All of a sudden, an old man declared that his pocket had been picked. He accused the man standing beside him. The young man took a knife out of his pocket and waved it in the air. No body dared to catch him. I thanked God when the bus stopped at the railway station. I reached there just in time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n            &quot;&quot;&quot;\n# The character encoding for the email.\nCHARSET = &quot;UTF-8&quot;\n# Create a new SES resource and specify a region.\nclient = boto3.client('ses',region_name=AWS_REGION)\nstart = time.time()\n# Try to send the email.\ntry:\n    #Provide the contents of the email.\n    response = client.send_email(\n        Destination={\n            'ToAddresses': [\n                RECIPIENT,\n            ],\n        },\n        Message={\n            'Body': {\n                'Html': {\n                    'Charset': CHARSET,\n                    'Data': BODY_HTML,\n                },\n                'Text': {\n                    'Charset': CHARSET,\n                    'Data': BODY_TEXT,\n                },\n            },\n            'Subject': {\n                'Charset': CHARSET,\n                'Data': SUBJECT,\n            },\n        },\n        Source=SENDER,\n        # If you are not using a configuration set, comment or delete the\n        # following line\n        # ConfigurationSetName=CONFIGURATION_SET,\n    )\n# Display an error if something goes wrong. \nexcept ClientError as e:\n    print(e.response['Error']['Message'])\nelse:\n    print(&quot;Email sent!

But the annotation must be written in Java (scala annotations can&#39;t annotate Java code). And the annotation processor will not handle Scala sources. Java compile-time annotation processing is handled by Java compiler, it can&#39;t compile Scala sources.\r\n\r\nScala compiler is not aware of any annotation processors.\r\nIn Scala compile-time annotation processing is macro annotations (similarly they can handle Scala sources, not Java sources). Scala macro annotations and Java annotation processors are two completely different mechanisms doing similar things with Scala sources and Java sources coordingly.\r\n \r\nSo if you want to process Java and Scala sources similarly you&#39;ll have to duplicate efforts. You&#39;ll have to create annotation processor handling Java sources and macro annotation doing similar thing to Scala sources.\r\n\r\nHere is an example with [creating][1] a builder. The annotation processor creates a builder in `target/scala-2.13/classes`, the macro annotation creates a builder inside a companion object. This is a difference between processors and macro annotations: processors can generate code but not re-write it (without Java compiler internals [1][2] [2][3]), macro annotations can re-write code but only in a class and its companion. One more difference is that the processors generate Java sources while macro annotations generate Scala ASTs.\r\n\r\n*annotation-processor/src/main/java/org/example/BuilderProperty.java*\r\n```java\r\npackage org.example;\r\n\r\nimport java.lang.annotation.ElementType;\r\nimport java.lang.annotation.Retention;\r\nimport java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;\r\nimport java.lang.annotation.Target;\r\n\r\n@Target(ElementType.METHOD)\r\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.SOURCE)\r\npublic @interface BuilderProperty {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n*annotation-processor/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/javax.annotation.processing.Processor*\r\n```text\r\norg.example.BuilderProcessor\r\n```\r\n*annotation-processor/src/main/scala/org/example/BuilderProcessor.scala*\r\n```scala\r\npackage org.example\r\n\r\n//import com.google.auto.service.AutoService\r\nimport javax.annotation.processing._\r\nimport javax.lang.model.SourceVersion\r\nimport javax.lang.model.element.{Element, TypeElement}\r\nimport javax.lang.model.`type`.ExecutableType\r\nimport javax.tools.Diagnostic\r\nimport java.io.IOException\r\nimport java.io.PrintWriter\r\nimport java.util\r\nimport scala.collection.immutable\r\nimport scala.jdk.CollectionConverters._\r\nimport scala.util.Using\r\n\r\n@SupportedAnnotationTypes(Array(&quot;org.example.BuilderProperty&quot;))\r\n@SupportedSourceVersion(SourceVersion.RELEASE_8)\r\n//@AutoService(Array(classOf[Processor])) // can&#39;t use AutoService because the processor is written in Scala, so using the file in META-INF\r\nclass BuilderProcessor extends AbstractProcessor {\r\n  override def process(annotations: util.Set[_ &lt;: TypeElement], roundEnv: RoundEnvironment): Boolean = {\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;process&quot;)\r\n//    println(&quot;process&quot;) // java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: scala.Predef$.println(Ljava/lang/Object;)V //com.sun.tools.javac.main.Main.compile //sbt.internal.inc.javac.LocalJavaCompiler.run\r\n//    annotations.asScala.toSet[TypeElement].foreach { annotation =&gt;

One more difference is that the processors generate Java sources while macro annotations generate Scala ASTs.</p>\n<p><em>annotation-processor/src/main/java/org/example/BuilderProperty.java</em></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>package org.example;\n\nimport java.lang.annotation.ElementType;\nimport java.lang.annotation.Retention;\nimport java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;\nimport java.lang.annotation.Target;\n\n@Target(ElementType.METHOD)\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.SOURCE)\npublic @interface BuilderProperty {\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>annotation-processor/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/javax.annotation.processing.Processor</em></p>\n<pre><code>org.example.BuilderProcessor\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>annotation-processor/src/main/scala/org/example/BuilderProcessor.scala</em></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-scala prettyprint-override\"><code>package org.example\n\n//import com.google.auto.service.AutoService\nimport javax.annotation.processing._\nimport javax.lang.model.SourceVersion\nimport javax.lang.model.element.{Element, TypeElement}\nimport javax.lang.model.`type`.ExecutableType\nimport javax.tools.Diagnostic\nimport java.io.IOException\nimport java.io.PrintWriter\nimport java.util\nimport scala.collection.immutable\nimport scala.jdk.CollectionConverters._\nimport scala.util.Using\n\n@SupportedAnnotationTypes(Array(&quot;org.example.BuilderProperty&quot;))\n@SupportedSourceVersion(SourceVersion.RELEASE_8)\n//@AutoService(Array(classOf[Processor])) // can't use AutoService because the processor is written in Scala, so using the file in META-INF\nclass BuilderProcessor extends AbstractProcessor {\n  override def process(annotations: util.Set[_ &lt;: TypeElement], roundEnv: RoundEnvironment): Boolean = {\n    System.out.println(&quot;process&quot;)\n//    println(&quot;process&quot;) // java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: scala.Predef$.println(Ljava/lang/Object;)V //com.sun.tools.javac.main.Main.compile //sbt.internal.inc.javac.LocalJavaCompiler.run\n//    annotations.asScala.toSet[TypeElement].foreach { annotation =&gt;

WHY to use @Target(ANNOTATION_TYPE) value?\r\n\r\nWhen there is need to apply an annotation to an another annotation.

What are the annotated annotations good for? \r\n\r\nThey are good or more precisely necessary if they are used to annotate other annotations. \r\n\r\n3. What is their contribution? \r\n\r\nThey make possible to apply an annotation directly to an another annotation, that is a different thing than applying an annotation to a standard Java class or to method and so on.\r\n\r\n4.  Give me an explanation of an idea how it works and why I should use it. \r\n\r\nFor example, if you create a data model class and you may want that the program checks data validity. In that case, there might be need to create a new annotation and apply another annotations to this annotation. It is simple to add some data validity checks to this model by adding annotations to the class. For example, to check that some value is not null (@notNull) or email is valid (@ValidEmail) or length of a field is more than x characters (@Size). However, it is possible that there is not built in Java annotations for all purposes. For example, it is so if you liked to check if password and its matchingPassword  are same. This is possible by creating the annotation class PasswordMatches: \r\n\r\n    @Target({TYPE})\r\n    @Retention(RUNTIME)\r\n    @Constraint(validatedBy = PasswordMatchesValidator.class)\r\n    @Documented\r\n    public @interface PasswordMatches {\r\n\r\n\t    String message() default &quot;Passwords don&#39;t match&quot;;\r\n\r\n\t    Class&lt;?&gt;[] groups() default {};\r\n\r\n\t    Class&lt;? extends Payload&gt;[] payload() default {};\r\n\r\n     }\r\n\r\nNote, there is line \r\n    \r\n    @Constraint(validatedBy = PasswordMatchesValidator.class).\r\n\r\nIn other words, the annotation class Constraint, like the other annotations in this class also, must have ANNOTATION_TYPE as a value of target annotation.\r\n\r\nNow the password equality check is easy to include to data model class simply by adding annotation @PasswordMatches:\r\n    \r\n    @PasswordMatches \r\n    public class UserDto {\r\n    ... \r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe PasswordMatchesValidator class could look like this:\r\n\r\n    public class PasswordMatchesValidator implements ConstraintValidator&lt;PasswordMatches, Object&gt; {\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void initialize(final PasswordMatches constraintAnnotation) {}\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean isValid(final Object obj, final ConstraintValidatorContext context) {\r\n        final UserDto user = (UserDto) obj;\r\n        return user.getPassword().equals(user.getMatchingPassword());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n5.

This is possible because instantiation of the required object is deferred to the builder until all needed attributes are obtained.\r\n\r\nConsider the process of building a &quot;widget&quot;. Assume this &quot;widget&quot; has two components, of which only one is required. You can either A) build the &quot;widget&quot; without the optional component, or B) you can assemble the &quot;widget&quot; with the required part, pause the build process and resume at a later time when the optional component is available. When using a conventional constructor, this is not possible. \r\n\r\nAnother advantage of the Builder pattern is that you don&#39;t need to create a constructor with a lot of parameters that are not required. And it eliminates the need to have multiple permutations of the constructor with different parameters. In fact, sometimes this is not even possible. For example, if the class in question has eight String parameters, you cannot have two constructors with four Strings each.\r\n\r\nWhen implementing this pattern, the &quot;widget&quot; being built has only one constructor, and it is private. The constructor of the class is only accessible to the builder. \r\n\r\nLastly, unlike conventional &quot;setter&quot; methods, the &quot;setter&quot; methods of a builder return an instance of the builder itself. This allows chaining method calls to set multiple (optional) parameters. For example; `builder.setOptionalParm1(val1).setOptionalParm2(val2)...` etc.\r\n \r\n\r\n## Builder Pattern Code Example ##\r\n```\r\npublic class ImmutableWidget {\r\n\t\r\n\tprivate final String required;\r\n\tprivate final String optional;\r\n\t\r\n\tprivate ImmutableWidget (Builder builder) {\r\n\t\tthis.required = builder.required;\r\n\t\tthis.optional = builder.optional;\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic String toString () {\r\n\t\treturn &quot;Required: &quot; + required + &quot;; Optional: &quot; + optional;\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tpublic String getRequired () {\r\n\t\treturn required;\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tpublic String getOptional () {\r\n\t\treturn optional;\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tpublic static class Builder {\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tprivate final String required;\r\n\t\tprivate String optional;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tpublic Builder (String required) {\r\n\t\t\tthis.required = required;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tpublic Builder setOptional (String optional) {\r\n\t\t\tthis.optional = optional;\r\n\t\t\treturn this;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tpublic ImmutableWidget build () {\r\n\t\t\treturn new ImmutableWidget (this);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tpublic static void main (String... strings) {\r\n\t\tBuilder builder = new ImmutableWidget.Builder (&quot;required&quot;);\r\n        builder.setOptional(&quot;optional&quot;); // This step is not required\r\n\t\tImmutableWidget widget = builder.build();\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(widget);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Additional information ##\r\n\r\n 1.

Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know of any that do, but I am considering adding [Exif orientation support to the TwelveMonkeys ImageIO JPEGImageReader](https://github.com/haraldk/TwelveMonkeys/issues/288) in the future. \r\n\r\nIn the mean time, you have to apply the rotation yourself, by reading the metadata and rotating. The value of the orientation tag can be acquired either using the [ImageIO JPEG metadata](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/imageio/metadata/doc-files/jpeg_metadata.html) or some third-party library. I think both the mentioned [metadata-extractor](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor) or [TwelveMonkeys ImageIO](https://github.com/haraldk/TwelveMonkeys/) can be used for this purpose. JAI ImageIO (using the TIFF metadata) can probably also do this. \r\n\r\nIf using the ImageIO JPEG metadata, be aware:\r\n\r\n&gt; Note that an application wishing to interpret Exif metadata given a metadata tree structure in the `javax_imageio_jpeg_image_1.0` format must check for an `unknown` marker segment with a tag indicating an `APP1` marker and containing data identifying it as an Exif marker segment.

And while the JRE-bundled plug-in does not take Exif into account, it is possible to add support for it, in a third-party <code>ImageReader</code>. Unfortunately, I don't know of any that do, but I am considering adding <a href=\"https://github.com/haraldk/TwelveMonkeys/issues/288\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exif orientation support to the TwelveMonkeys ImageIO JPEGImageReader</a> in the future. </p>\n\n<p>In the mean time, you have to apply the rotation yourself, by reading the metadata and rotating. The value of the orientation tag can be acquired either using the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/imageio/metadata/doc-files/jpeg_metadata.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ImageIO JPEG metadata</a> or some third-party library.

JAI ImageIO (using the TIFF metadata) can probably also do this. </p>\n\n<p>If using the ImageIO JPEG metadata, be aware:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note that an application wishing to interpret Exif metadata given a metadata tree structure in the <code>javax_imageio_jpeg_image_1.0</code> format must check for an <code>unknown</code> marker segment with a tag indicating an <code>APP1</code> marker and containing data identifying it as an Exif marker segment. </p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":26834374,"reputation":1,"user_id":20421849,"display_name":"wum"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1667604528,"creation_date":1667604528,"answer_id":74323939,"question_id":47657302,"body_markdown":"I have struggled with jpeg exif orientation for awhile, and now that I set out to fix my problems, I find that they are gone.

This may hint on the cause for the glitches being the jdk.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import javax.swing.*;\nimport java.awt.*;\nimport java.awt.font.*;\nimport java.util.*;\n\n\n/**\n        Tested on: Edition Windows 11 Pro\n        Version    22H2\n        OS build   22623.875\n        Experience Windows Feature Experience Pack 1000.22636.1000.0\n        \n        openjdk 17.0.4.1 2022-08-12\n        OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-17.0.4.1+1 (build 17.0.4.1+1)\n        OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-17.0.4.1+1 (build 17.0.4.1+1, mixed mode, sharing)\n**/\npublic class Main {\n    private static final boolean TEST_KERNING = true;\n    private static final boolean TEST_LIGATURES = true;\n    private static final String TEST_FONT = &quot;Segoe UI Variable&quot;;\n    private static final Number TEST_FONT_SIZE = 40;\n    private static final Number TEST_FONT_WIDTH = TextAttribute.WEIGHT_BOLD;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());\n\n        Map&lt;TextAttribute, Object&gt; textAttributes = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n        textAttributes.put(TextAttribute.FAMILY, TEST_FONT);\n        textAttributes.put(TextAttribute.SIZE, TEST_FONT_SIZE);\n        textAttributes.put(TextAttribute.WEIGHT, TEST_FONT_WIDTH);\n        if(TEST_KERNING)\n            textAttributes.put(TextAttribute.KERNING, TextAttribute.KERNING_ON);\n        if(TEST_LIGATURES)\n            textAttributes.put(TextAttribute.LIGATURES, TextAttribute.LIGATURES_ON);\n        Font font = Font.getFont(textAttributes);\n\n        JTextField txtInput = new JTextField();\n        txtInput.setFont(font);\n\n        JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;Demo&quot;);\n        frame.setSize(400, 100);\n        frame.add(txtInput);\n        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n\n        SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(() -&gt;\n            frame.setVisible(true)\n        );\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":9315,"page":908,"page_size":100}
