In which case you might still try to use `map()` but it would be unpractical. Let me try to explain why.\r\n\r\nIf in such case you decided to stick with `map`, you would get an `Observable&lt;Observable&lt;Something&gt;&gt;`. For example in your case, if we used an imaginary RxGson library, that returned an `Observable&lt;String&gt;` from it&#39;s `toJson()` method (instead of simply returning a `String`) it would look like this:\r\n\r\n    Observable.from(jsonFile).map(new Func1&lt;File, Observable&lt;String&gt;&gt;() {\r\n        @Override public Observable&lt;String&gt;&gt; call(File file) {\r\n            return new RxGson().toJson(new FileReader(file), Object.class);\r\n        }\r\n    }); // you get Observable&lt;Observable&lt;String&gt;&gt; here\r\n\r\nAt this point it would be pretty tricky to `subscribe()` to such an observable. Inside of it you would get an `Observable&lt;String&gt;` to which you would again need to `subscribe()` to get the value. Which is not practical or nice to look at.\r\n\r\nSo to make it useful one idea is to &quot;flatten&quot; this observable of observables (you might start to see where the name _flat_Map comes from). RxJava provides a few ways to flatten observables and for sake of simplicity lets assume [merge](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/merge.html) is what we want. Merge basically takes a bunch of observables and emits whenever any of them emits. (Lots of people would argue [switch](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/switch.html) would be a better default. But if you&#39;re emitting just one value, it doesn&#39;t matter anyway.)\r\n\r\nSo amending our previous snippet we would get:\r\n\r\n    Observable.from(jsonFile).map(new Func1&lt;File, Observable&lt;String&gt;&gt;() {\r\n        @Override public Observable&lt;String&gt;&gt; call(File file) {\r\n            return new RxGson().toJson(new FileReader(file), Object.class);\r\n        }\r\n    }).merge(); // you get Observable&lt;String&gt; here\r\n\r\nThis is a lot more useful, because subscribing to that (or mapping, or filtering, or...) you just get the `String` value. (Also, mind you, such variant of `merge()` does not exist in RxJava, but if you understand the idea of merge then I hope you also understand how that would work.)\r\n\r\nSo basically because such `merge()` should probably only ever be useful when it succeeds a `map()` returning an observable and so you don&#39;t have to type this over and over again, `flatMap()` was created as a shorthand. It applies the mapping function just as a normal `map()` would, but later instead of emitting the returned values it also &quot;flattens&quot; (or merges) them.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s the general use case. It is most useful in a codebase that uses Rx allover the place and you&#39;ve got many methods returning observables, which you want to chain with other methods returning observables.\r\n\r\nIn your use case it happens to be useful as well, because `map()` can only transform one value emitted in `onNext()` into another value emitted in `onNext()`.

Instead of using that c3p0.properties file, couldn't you just use this property in your hibernate.cfg.xml:\n\n&lt;property name=\"hibernate.c3p0.validate\"&gt;true&lt;/property&gt;\n\n    Also checkout the last post on this page:\n\n    https://forum.hibernate.org/viewtopic.php?p=2399313\n\n    If all these not work than go [more][1] and read in detail\n\n\n  [1]: http://hibernatedb.blogspot.in/2009/05/automatic-reconnect-from-hibernate-to.html\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":35487,"reputation":64776,"user_id":100516,"accept_rate":69,"display_name":"Roman"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":77103,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":54,"accepted_answer_id":2077182,"answer_count":4,"score":54,"last_activity_date":1636357496,"creation_date":1263639664,"question_id":2077081,"body_markdown":"I read this advice from error message:\r\n\r\n&gt; You should consider either expiring\r\n&gt; and/or testing connection validity\r\n&gt; before use in your application,\r\n&gt; increasing the server configured\r\n&gt; values for client timeouts, or using\r\n&gt; the Connector/J connection property\r\n&gt; &#39;autoReconnect=true&#39; to avoid this\r\n&gt; problem.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using Spring and JPA.

Only the former was not enough to kick off instrumentation, I needed both agents. Because on JDK 16+ you need to open the `java.lang` package to the unnamed module in order to be able to apply LTW and I was testing on a recent JDK, I also added the corresponding `--add-opens` option (not necessary until JDK 15):\r\n\r\n```none\r\n--add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED\r\n-javaagent:.../aspectjweaver-1.9.7.jar\r\n-javaagent:.../spring-instrument-5.3.12.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen everything works es expected:\r\n\r\n```none\r\no.s.b.d.a.OptionalLiveReloadServer       : LiveReload server is running on port 35729\r\no.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http) with context path &#39;&#39;\r\ncom.example.aspectj.AspectjApplication   : Started AspectjApplication in 7.339 seconds (JVM running for 10.046)\r\ncom.example.aspectj.AspectjApplication   : running ..\r\ncom.example.aspectj.services.FooService  : m1 : called\r\no.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager        : Creating new transaction with name [com.example.aspectj.services.BooService.m3]: PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,ISOLATION_DEFAULT\r\no.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager        : Opened new EntityManager [SessionImpl(1516190088&lt;open&gt;)] for JPA transaction\r\no.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager        : Exposing JPA transaction as JDBC [org.springframework.orm.jpa.vendor.HibernateJpaDialect$HibernateConnectionHandle@543f6ccb]\r\ncom.example.aspectj.services.BooService  : m3 : called\r\no.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager        : Initiating transaction commit\r\no.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager        : Committing JPA transaction on EntityManager [SessionImpl(1516190088&lt;open&gt;)]\r\no.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager        : Closing JPA EntityManager [SessionImpl(1516190088&lt;open&gt;)] after transaction\r\no.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager        : Creating new transaction with name [com.example.aspectj.services.FooService.m2]: PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,ISOLATION_DEFAULT\r\no.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager        : Opened new EntityManager [SessionImpl(45178615&lt;open&gt;)] for JPA transaction\r\no.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager        : Exposing JPA transaction as JDBC [org.springframework.orm.jpa.vendor.HibernateJpaDialect$HibernateConnectionHandle@20e4fce0]\r\ncom.example.aspectj.services.FooService  : m2 : called\r\no.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager        : Initiating transaction commit\r\no.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager        : Committing JPA transaction on EntityManager [SessionImpl(45178615&lt;open&gt;)]\r\no.s.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager        : Closing JPA EntityManager [SessionImpl(45178615&lt;open&gt;)] after transaction\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Update:** I am really sorry for problems that come with Spring (Boot) out of the box, but as it is now, you either have to live with the AspectJ core dump files `ajdump.*.txt` - the transaction aspect weaving still works, like I said before - or use your own `aop.xml` file (see above). As an alternative to including your own application base package for aspect weaving, you can also go the opposite direction of excluding the classes or packages causing the core dumps. In Spring Boot 2.5.6, you simply add\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;exclude within=&quot;org.springframework.boot.jdbc.DataSourceBuilder.OraclePoolDataSourceProperties&quot;/&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Spring Boot 2.3.3, AspectJ complains about this class:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;exclude within=&quot;org.springframework.boot.diagnostics.analyzer.ValidationExceptionFailureAnalyzer&quot;/&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this needs to be fixed in Spring Boot or maybe in Spring Core, Spring-TX or Spring-Aspects, wherever those aspects are located.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Update 2:** I have created [Spring Core issue #27650](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/27650) in order to track the AspectJ core dump problem. It is not the root cause of your original problem, because transaction aspect weaving works anyway, but it needs to be addressed in Spring (and possibly in AspectJ) anyway.","title":"@Transactional not applied with AspectJ","body":"<p>I cloned your GitHub project, then added</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>implementation 'org.springframework:spring-instrument'\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should also limit the Spring (transaction) aspect scope to only weave your own application classes in order to avoid lots of <code>[Xlint:cantFindType]</code> messages when trying to weave Spring's own classes.

My error was this:\r\n\r\n    com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException: Communications link failure\r\n\r\n    The last packet sent successfully to the server was 0 milliseconds ago. The driver has not received any packets from the server.\r\n\r\nI spent several days to solve this problem. I have tested many approaches that have been mentioned in different web sites, but non of them worked. Finally I changed my code and found out what was the problem. I&#39;ll try to tell you about different approaches and **sum them up here**.\r\n\r\nWhile I was seeking the internet to find the solution for this error, I figured out that **there are many solutions that worked for at least one person, but others say that it doesn&#39;t work for them!** *why there are many approaches to this error?*\r\nIt seems **this error can occur *generally* when there is a problem in connecting to the server**. Maybe the problem is because of the wrong query string or too many connections to the database.\r\n\r\nSo I suggest you to try all the solutions one by one and don&#39;t give up!\r\n\r\nHere are the solutions that I found on the internet and for each of them, there is at least on person who his problem has been solved with that solution.\r\n\r\nTip: For the solutions that you need to change the MySQL settings, you can refer to the following files:\r\n\r\n - Linux: `/etc/mysql/my.cnf` or `/etc/my.cnf` (depending on the Linux distribution and MySQL package used)\r\n   \r\n - Windows: `C:\\**ProgramData**\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 5.6\\my.ini` (Notice it&#39;s ProgramData, not Program Files)\r\n\r\n# Here are the solutions: #\r\n\r\n- changing `bind-address` attribute:\r\n\r\n   Uncomment `bind-address` attribute or change it to one of the following IPs:\r\n\r\n       bind-address=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;\r\n\r\n   or\r\n\r\n       bind-address=&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;\r\n\r\n- **commenting out &quot;skip-networking&quot;**\r\n\r\n   If there is a `skip-networking` line in your MySQL config file, make it comment by adding `#` sign at the beginning of that line.\r\n\r\n- **change &quot;wait_timeout&quot; and &quot;interactive_timeout&quot;**\r\n\r\n   Add these lines to the MySQL config file:\r\n\r\n      [wait_timeout][1] = *number*\r\n    \r\n      interactive_timeout = *number*\r\n    \r\n      connect_timeout = *number*\r\n\r\n- **Make sure Java isn&#39;t translating &#39;localhost&#39; to [:::1] instead of [127.0.0.1]** \r\n\r\n   Since MySQL recognizes `127.0.0.1` (`IPv4`) but not `:::1` (`IPv6`)\r\n\r\n   This could be avoided by using one of two approaches:\r\n\r\n   1. In the connection string use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` to avoid `localhost` being translated to `:::1`\r\n\r\n   2. Run java with the option `-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true` to force java to use `IPv4` instead of `IPv6`. On Linux, this could also be achieved by running (or placing it inside `/etc/profile`:\r\n\r\n          export _JAVA_OPTIONS=&quot;-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true&quot;\r\n\r\n- **check Operating System proxy settings, firewalls and anti-virus programs**\r\n\r\n   Make sure the Firewall, or Anti-virus software isn&#39;t blocking MySQL service.\r\n\r\n   Stop iptables temporarily on linux. If iptables are misconfigured they may allow tcp packets to be sent to mysql port, but block tcp packets from coming back on the same connection.\r\n\r\n       # Redhat enterprise and CentOS\r\n       systemctl stop iptables.service\r\n       # Other linux distros\r\n       service iptables stop\r\n\r\n   Stop anti-virus software on Windows.\r\n\r\n- **change connection string**\r\n\r\n   Check your query string. your connection string should be some thing like this:\r\n\r\n      dbName = &quot;my_database&quot;;\r\n      dbUserName = &quot;root&quot;;\r\n      dbPassword = &quot;&quot;;\r\n      String connectionString = &quot;jdbc:mysql://localhost/&quot; + dbName + &quot;?user=&quot; + dbUserName + &quot;&amp;password=&quot; + dbPassword + &quot;&amp;useUnicode=true&amp;characterEncoding=UTF-8&quot;;\r\n\r\nMake sure you don&#39;t have spaces in your string. All the connection string should be continues without any space characters.\r\n\r\nTry to replace &quot;localhost&quot; with the loopback address 127.0.0.1.\r\nAlso try to add port number to your connection string, like:\r\n\r\n    String connectionString = &quot;jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/my_database?user=root&amp;password=Pass&amp;useUnicode=true&amp;characterEncoding=UTF-8&quot;;\r\n\r\nUsually default port for MySQL is 3306.\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t forget to change username and password to the username and password of your MySQL server.\r\n\r\n- **update your JDK driver library file**\r\n- **test different JDK and JREs (like JDK 6 and 7)**\r\n- **don&#39;t change max_allowed_packet**\r\n\r\n&quot;[max_allowed_packet][4]&quot; is a variable in MySQL config file that indicates the maximum packet size, not the maximum number of packets. So it will not help to solve this error.\r\n\r\n- **change tomcat security**\r\n\r\nchange TOMCAT6_SECURITY=yes to TOMCAT6_SECURITY=no\r\n\r\n- **use validationQuery property**\r\n\r\nuse validationQuery=&quot;select now()&quot; to make sure each query has responses\r\n\r\n- **AutoReconnect**\r\n\r\nAdd this code to your connection string:\r\n\r\n    &amp;autoReconnect=true&amp;failOverReadOnly=false&amp;maxReconnects=10\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough non of these solutions worked for me, I suggest you to try them. Because there are some people who solved their problem with following these steps.\r\n\r\n**But what solved my problem?**\r\n\r\nMy problem was that I had many SELECTs on database. Each time I was creating a connection and then closing it. Although I was closing the connection every time, but the system faced with many connections and gave me that error. **What I did was that I defined my connection variable as a public (or private) variable for whole class and initialized it in the constructor.** Then every time I just used that connection. It solved my problem and also increased my speed dramatically.\r\n\r\n#Conclusion#\r\nThere is no simple and unique way to solve this problem.

If you take this error at the beginning of the program and you are not able to connect to the database at all, you might have problem in your connection string.

My error was this:</p>\n<pre><code>com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.CommunicationsException: Communications link failure\n\nThe last packet sent successfully to the server was 0 milliseconds ago. The driver has not received any packets from the server.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I spent several days to solve this problem. I have tested many approaches that have been mentioned in different web sites, but non of them worked. Finally I changed my code and found out what was the problem. I'll try to tell you about different approaches and <strong>sum them up here</strong>.</p>\n<p>While I was seeking the internet to find the solution for this error, I figured out that <strong>there are many solutions that worked for at least one person, but others say that it doesn't work for them!</strong> <em>why there are many approaches to this error?</em>\nIt seems <strong>this error can occur <em>generally</em> when there is a problem in connecting to the server</strong>. Maybe the problem is because of the wrong query string or too many connections to the database.</p>\n<p>So I suggest you to try all the solutions one by one and don't give up!</p>\n<p>Here are the solutions that I found on the internet and for each of them, there is at least on person who his problem has been solved with that solution.</p>\n<p>Tip: For the solutions that you need to change the MySQL settings, you can refer to the following files:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Linux: <code>/etc/mysql/my.cnf</code> or <code>/etc/my.cnf</code> (depending on the Linux distribution and MySQL package used)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Windows: <code>C:\\**ProgramData**\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 5.6\\my.ini</code> (Notice it's ProgramData, not Program Files)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Here are the solutions:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><p>changing <code>bind-address</code> attribute:</p>\n<p>Uncomment <code>bind-address</code> attribute or change it to one of the following IPs:</p>\n<pre><code> bind-address=&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>or</p>\n<pre><code> bind-address=&quot;0.0.0.0&quot;\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>commenting out &quot;skip-networking&quot;</strong></p>\n<p>If there is a <code>skip-networking</code> line in your MySQL config file, make it comment by adding <code>#</code> sign at the beginning of that line.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>change &quot;wait_timeout&quot; and &quot;interactive_timeout&quot;</strong></p>\n<p>Add these lines to the MySQL config file:</p>\n<pre><code>[wait_timeout][1] = *number*\n\ninteractive_timeout = *number*\n\nconnect_timeout = *number*\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Make sure Java isn't translating 'localhost' to [:::1] instead of [127.0.0.1]</strong></p>\n<p>Since MySQL recognizes <code>127.0.0.1</code> (<code>IPv4</code>) but not <code>:::1</code> (<code>IPv6</code>)</p>\n<p>This could be avoided by using one of two approaches:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>In the connection string use <code>127.0.0.1</code> instead of <code>localhost</code> to avoid <code>localhost</code> being translated to <code>:::1</code></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Run java with the option <code>-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true</code> to force java to use <code>IPv4</code> instead of <code>IPv6</code>.

If iptables are misconfigured they may allow tcp packets to be sent to mysql port, but block tcp packets from coming back on the same connection.</p>\n<pre><code> # Redhat enterprise and CentOS\n systemctl stop iptables.service\n # Other linux distros\n service iptables stop\n</code></pre>\n<p>Stop anti-virus software on Windows.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>change connection string</strong></p>\n<p>Check your query string. your connection string should be some thing like this:</p>\n<pre><code>dbName = &quot;my_database&quot;;\ndbUserName = &quot;root&quot;;\ndbPassword = &quot;&quot;;\nString connectionString = &quot;jdbc:mysql://localhost/&quot; + dbName + &quot;?user=&quot; + dbUserName + &quot;&amp;password=&quot; + dbPassword + &quot;&amp;useUnicode=true&amp;characterEncoding=UTF-8&quot;;\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Make sure you don't have spaces in your string. All the connection string should be continues without any space characters.</p>\n<p>Try to replace &quot;localhost&quot; with the loopback address 127.0.0.1.\nAlso try to add port number to your connection string, like:</p>\n<pre><code>String connectionString = &quot;jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/my_database?user=root&amp;password=Pass&amp;useUnicode=true&amp;characterEncoding=UTF-8&quot;;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Usually default port for MySQL is 3306.</p>\n<p>Don't forget to change username and password to the username and password of your MySQL server.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>update your JDK driver library file</strong></li>\n<li><strong>test different JDK and JREs (like JDK 6 and 7)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>don't change max_allowed_packet</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&quot;<a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_allowed_packet\" rel=\"noreferrer\">max_allowed_packet</a>&quot; is a variable in MySQL config file that indicates the maximum packet size, not the maximum number of packets.

Because there are some people who solved their problem with following these steps.</p>\n<p><strong>But what solved my problem?</strong></p>\n<p>My problem was that I had many SELECTs on database. Each time I was creating a connection and then closing it. Although I was closing the connection every time, but the system faced with many connections and gave me that error. <strong>What I did was that I defined my connection variable as a public (or private) variable for whole class and initialized it in the constructor.</strong> Then every time I just used that connection. It solved my problem and also increased my speed dramatically.</p>\n<p>#Conclusion#\nThere is no simple and unique way to solve this problem. I suggest you to think about your own situation and choose above solutions.
