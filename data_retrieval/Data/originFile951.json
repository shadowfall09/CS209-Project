This allows you to easily change the `List` to a `LinkedList` or some other implementation without breaking the rest of your code because it is guaranteed to use only methods available in the `List` interface. For more information, you should research &quot;programming to the interface.&quot;\r\n\r\nNow to answer your real question, which was only added as a comment.

Each time the loop iterates, you assign new values **to the same array** and add **another reference to the same array** to the `List`. This means that the `List` has 10 references **to the same array** which has been repeatedly written over.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Iterator it = list.iterator();\r\n    while (it.hasNext()) {\r\n        point = (Integer[])it.next();\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\r\n            System.out.print(point[i] + &quot;,&quot;);\r\n        } \r\n            System.out.println(); \r\n        } \r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow this loop prints out the **same array** 10 times. The values in the array are the last ones set at the end of the previous loop.\r\n\r\nTo fix the problem, you simply need to be sure to create 10 **different** arrays.\r\n\r\nOne last issue: If you declare `it` as `Iterator&lt;Integer[]&gt; it` (or `Iterator&lt;int[]&gt; it`), you do not need to cast the return value of `it.next()`. In fact this is preferred because it is type-safe.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to ask what the `int`s in each array represent?

If you want to find out how _exactly_ is `gradle` building the `module-path` (as opposed to `class-path`), you probably want to start from [here][1], specifically at the [isModuleJar][2] method. It&#39;s pretty easy to understand (though it took me almost two days to set-up gradle and debug the problem out) that the dependency that you are trying to use : gradle says that it is not a module (it isn&#39;t wrong, but I am not sure it is correct either). To make it very correct, `gradle` [will add your dependency to the CLASSPATH][3], but in the very next line: it will _not_ add your dependency to the `module-path`, because if fails the filter in `isModuleJar`.\r\n\r\nI do not know if this is a bug or not, or may be this is on purpose, but the solution is easy:\r\n\r\n    plugins.withType(JavaPlugin).configureEach {\r\n        java {\r\n            modularity.inferModulePath = true\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {\r\n            doFirst {\r\n                options.compilerArgs = [\r\n                    &#39;--module-path&#39;, classpath.asPath,\r\n                ]\r\n                classpath = files()\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nyou add it to the path, on purpose.

I assumed you wanted to add JavaScript to an existing PDF so that the user can add valid data.\r\n\r\nWhat you are looking for is a way to extract the JavaScript from an existing PDF. You already get an impression on how to do that in the answer I referred to in my previous answer. For JavaScript added to specific fields, you need to inspect the Additional Actions:\r\n\r\n    AcroFields form = stamper.getAcroFields();\r\n    AcroFields.Item fd = form.getFieldItem(&quot;married&quot;);\r\n    // Get the PDF dictionary of the YES radio button and add an additional action\r\n    PdfDictionary dictYes =\r\n        (PdfDictionary) PdfReader.getPdfObject(fd.getWidgetRef(0));\r\n    PdfDictionary yesAction = dictYes.getAsDict(PdfName.AA);\r\n    if (yesAction == null) yesAction = new PdfDictionary();\r\n    yesAction.put(new PdfName(&quot;Fo&quot;),\r\n            PdfAction.javaScript(&quot;setReadOnly(false);&quot;, stamper.getWriter()));\r\n    dictYes.put(PdfName.AA, yesAction);\r\n    // Get the PDF dictionary of the NO radio button and add an additional action\r\n    PdfDictionary dictNo =\r\n        (PdfDictionary) PdfReader.getPdfObject(fd.getWidgetRef(1));\r\n    PdfDictionary noAction = dictNo.getAsDict(PdfName.AA);\r\n\r\nIf `noAction` isn&#39;t null, you&#39;ll need to examine the different values in that dictionary. For instance: the `/Bl` entry (if present) will give you the action that is triggered *on blur*, the `/Fo` entry (if present) will give you the action that is triggerd *on focus*, and so on.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get the document-level JavaScript, you need to fetch the appropriate entry from the name tree in the Catalog of the PDF document. It is hard to explain in words, but if you download [RUPS][1] and inspect the PDF, you should be able to find the different JavaScript snippets. If we look at the file created using my incorrect answer (see below), we get this:\r\n\r\n![JavaScript viewed in RUPS][2]\r\n\r\nThis shows that you need something like this:\r\n\r\n    PdfDictionary catalog = reader.getCatalog();\r\n    PdfDictionary names = catalog.getAsDict(PdfName.NAMES);\r\n    PdfDictionary javascript = names.getAsDict(PdfName.JAVASCRIPT);\r\n\r\nOnce you have this `javascript` dictionary, you can extract all the Javascript snippets.\r\n\r\n**Incorrect answer:**\r\n\r\nI assume that you know how to write JavaScript (or more correctly ECMAScript). JavaScript in PDF is very similar to JavaScript in HTML. I assume you don&#39;t need help to write some JavaScript methods to check if input is valid.\r\n\r\nIf that is the case, you only need to know how to add the JavaScript to an existing PDF file. For instance: I have this PDF file named [form_without_js.pdf][3] to which I want to add some javascript, for instance [extra.js][4]. In [extra.js][5], you&#39;ll find a method that sets a field to read-only as well as a method that validates a field: if the value of `married` is `yes` and there is no value for `partner`, an alert is shown, otherwise the form is submitted. You&#39;ll have to write similar JavaScript depending on the nature of your form and which fields you want to check.\r\n\r\nThe [AddJavaScriptToForm][6] example shows you how to add these JavaScript methods to the existing PDF, resulting in the file [form_with_js.pdf][7].\r\n\r\nThis is done with `PdfReader` and `PdfStamper`:\r\n\r\n    PdfReader reader = new PdfReader(src);\r\n    PdfStamper stamper = new PdfStamper(reader, new FileOutputStream(dest));\r\n    // do stuff\r\n    stamper.close();\r\n    reader.close();\r\n\r\nWhere it says `// do stuff`, you need to do two things:\r\n\r\n[1.] You need to add the JavaScript snippet like this:\r\n\r\n    PdfWriter writer = stamper.getWriter();\r\n    writer.addJavaScript(Utilities.readFileToString(RESOURCE));\r\n\r\n[2.] You need to add some JavaScript to specific fields to call the custom methods you&#39;ve added.\r\nIn the example, you see a case where we add JavaScript as an additional action. You also see how we add a new button with a specific action. It&#39;s up to you to decide what is needed in your specific case.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://itextpdf.com/product/itext_rups\r\n  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/x48YO.png\r\n  [3]: http://examples.itextpdf.com/results/part4/chapter13/form_without_js.pdf\r\n  [4]: http://examples.itextpdf.com/resources/js/extra.js\r\n  [5]: http://examples.itextpdf.com/resources/js/extra.js\r\n  [6]: http://itextpdf.com/examples/iia.php?id=238\r\n  [7]: http://examples.itextpdf.com/results/part4/chapter13/form_with_js.pdf\r\n  [8]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/j3hTD.png","title":"How do I get Custom Format Script of Pdf form fields using iText?","body":"<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n<p>OOPS,\nI misinterpreted your question.

This will allow extraction of the \r\ndate/time string and temperature values for each line. The scanner and the two column \r\nnumbers are stored as instance variables.\r\n\r\n• parseLine(): parses (tokenizes) a line of a csv weather file, using the scanner object \r\ncreated by the constructor (instance variable). It finds the date/time string and the \r\ntemperature and stores them in instance variables. This method finds these values using \r\nthe columns identified by the constructor. Note: each time the parseLine method is called \r\nthe date/time string and the temperature instance data will be overwritten with the \r\nvalues from the next line of data.\r\n\r\n• Accessor methods: to retrieve the date/time string, the temperature, and determine \r\nwhether there are any more lines in the file.\r\n\r\nYou also may want to create private helper methods.\r\n\r\nTemperatureStats.java:\r\n\r\nwith a main method that does the following:\r\n\r\n• Creates an instance of TemperatureParser using the filename passed in as a command \r\nline argument. If the filename is missing from the command line, then the program \r\nterminates with the message:\r\nUsage: java TemperatureStats &lt;file.csv&gt;\r\n\r\n• Parses each line of the file using the parseLine() method (and the accessor methods) \r\nof TemperatureParser and records and prints the minimum and maximum \r\ntemperatures, along with the associated date/time string.\r\n\r\n• Handles the two kinds of exceptions described above: incomplete line or missing value \r\n(empty string instead), by printing a message identifying the line where the problem \r\noccurs (OK to assume that the date/time string will always be there), as in the examples \r\nabove.\r\n\r\n• Handles IOExceptions (e.g.: FileNotFoundException) by printing an appropriate \r\nmessage and ending the program.\r\n\r\nhere is sample Temperatures_Feb2021.csv:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&quot;Longitude (x)&quot;,&quot;Latitude (y)&quot;,&quot;Station Name&quot;,&quot;Climate ID&quot;,&quot;Date/Time (LST)&quot;,&quot;Year&quot;,&quot;Month&quot;,&quot;Day&quot;,&quot;Time (LST)&quot;,&quot;Temp (C)&quot;,&quot;Temp Flag&quot;,&quot;Dew Point Temp (&#176;C)&quot;,&quot;Dew Point Temp Flag&quot;,&quot;Rel Hum (%)&quot;,&quot;Rel Hum Flag&quot;,&quot;Precip.

Data may be incomplete. Your program must handle two possibilities. \r\nFirst, a line from the csv file may be incomplete, such as in the file for February 2021, \r\nwhere the weather data ends on &quot;2021-02-15 23:00”, but the remaining hours to the end \r\nof the month appear in the file with the weather data missing. Here’s how your program \r\nshould handle this:\r\n```\r\n$ java TemperatureStats Temperatures_Feb2021.csv\r\ninvalid entry at 2021-02-16 00:00\r\ninvalid entry at 2021-02-16 01:00\r\ninvalid entry at 2021-02-16 02:00\r\n...\r\ninvalid entry at 2021-02-28 22:00\r\ninvalid entry at 2021-02-28 23:00\r\nMaximum: 2021-02-03 16:00: 2.6\r\nMinimum: 2021-02-10 08:00: -23.0\r\n```\r\nNote that date and time for each line with missing data is identified (not all data is shown \r\nhere to keep the output short for the assignment document). The second way data may be \r\nincomplete is that a value may be missing, (an empty string, i.e. &quot; &quot;) shows up in the \r\ntemperature column, instead a value (such as &quot;-14.3&quot;). In the following example, the first \r\ntemperature in the January file was removed and replaced with &quot; &quot; (and saved in a file \r\ncalled Temperatures_Jan2021_Test.csv), which is handled in the same way as the first \r\nissue by identifying the line with an invalid entry:\r\n```\r\n$ java TemperatureStats Temperatures_Jan2021_Test.csv\r\ninvalid entry at 2021-01-01 00:00\r\nMaximum: 2021-01-15 15:00: 3.1\r\nMinimum: 2021-01-31 08:00: -19.3\r\n```\r\nI&#39;m trying to get the output right first, so I&#39;m not adding exceptions.\r\nThe problem I am having is that the csv file cannot be read\r\nthis is my code\r\n```\r\n\r\nimport java.io.File;\r\nimport java.io.FileNotFoundException;\r\nimport java.util.Scanner;\r\n\r\nimport static java.util.Arrays.stream;\r\n\r\npublic class TemperatureParser {\r\n    String time;\r\n    String temp;\r\n\r\n\r\n    public TemperatureParser() {\r\n        String time;\r\n        String temp;\r\n    }\r\n    static TemperatureParser[] weatherList;\r\n\r\n    public void setTime(String t) {\r\n        this.time = t;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setTemp(String temp) {\r\n        this.temp = temp;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getTemp() {\r\n        return temp;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getTime() {\r\n        return time;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void parsing(String file) throws FileNotFoundException {\r\n\r\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File(file));\r\n        Scanner valueScan = null;\r\n        Scanner headScan = null;\r\n        int index = 0;\r\n        int ii=0;\r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 30; i++) {\r\n            headScan = new Scanner(sc.nextLine());\r\n            headScan.useDelimiter(&quot;,&quot;);\r\n            String useless =headScan.nextLine();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        while (sc.hasNextLine()) {\r\n\r\n            valueScan = new Scanner(sc.nextLine());\r\n            valueScan.useDelimiter(&quot;,&quot;);\r\n            TemperatureParser parser = new TemperatureParser();\r\n            while (valueScan.hasNext()) {\r\n                String data = valueScan.next();\r\n                if (index == 5) {\r\n                    parser.setTime(data);\r\n                } else if (index == 10) {\r\n                    parser.setTemp(data);\r\n                }\r\n                index++;\r\n            }\r\n            index = 0;\r\n            weatherList[ii]=(parser);\r\n            ii++;\r\n        }\r\n        sc.close();\r\n    }\r\n    public double[] getTempArray(){\r\n        double[] tempArray = new double[weatherList.length];\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; weatherList.length; i++) {\r\n            tempArray[i]=Double.valueOf(weatherList[i].temp);\r\n        }\r\n        return tempArray;\r\n    }\r\n    public double max(){\r\n        return stream(getTempArray()).max().getAsDouble();\r\n    }\r\n    public double min(){\r\n        return stream(getTempArray()).min().getAsDouble();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n```\r\nimport java.io.FileNotFoundException;\r\npublic class TemperatureStats {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {\r\n        TemperatureParser parser = new TemperatureParser();\r\n        parser.parsing(args[0]);\r\n        System.out.println(parser.max());\r\n        System.out.println(parser.min());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"find max ,min in csv file in Java","body":"<p>For this assignment, I need two java classes to find the max and min temperatures in a CSV file.\nUsing the command line like this:</p>\n<pre><code>$ java TemperatureStats Temperatures_Feb2021.csv\n</code></pre>\n<p>output example:</p>\n<pre><code>$ java TemperatureStats Temperatures_Jan2021.csv\nHere is the output of the program for the first file:\nMaximum: 2021-01-15 15:00: 3.1\nMinimum: 2021-01-31 08:00: -19.3\n</code></pre>\n<p>here is the instruction for those two classes</p>\n<p>TemperatureParser.java:</p>\n<p>• Constructor: passed the filename as a parameter.

Note: each time the parseLine method is called\nthe date/time string and the temperature instance data will be overwritten with the\nvalues from the next line of data.</p>\n<p>• Accessor methods: to retrieve the date/time string, the temperature, and determine\nwhether there are any more lines in the file.</p>\n<p>You also may want to create private helper methods.</p>\n<p>TemperatureStats.java:</p>\n<p>with a main method that does the following:</p>\n<p>• Creates an instance of TemperatureParser using the filename passed in as a command\nline argument. If the filename is missing from the command line, then the program\nterminates with the message:\nUsage: java TemperatureStats &lt;file.csv&gt;</p>\n<p>• Parses each line of the file using the parseLine() method (and the accessor methods)\nof TemperatureParser and records and prints the minimum and maximum\ntemperatures, along with the associated date/time string.</p>\n<p>• Handles the two kinds of exceptions described above: incomplete line or missing value\n(empty string instead), by printing a message identifying the line where the problem\noccurs (OK to assume that the date/time string will always be there), as in the examples\nabove.</p>\n<p>• Handles IOExceptions (e.g.: FileNotFoundException) by printing an appropriate\nmessage and ending the program.</p>\n<p>here is sample Temperatures_Feb2021.csv:</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;Longitude (x)&quot;,&quot;Latitude (y)&quot;,&quot;Station Name&quot;,&quot;Climate ID&quot;,&quot;Date/Time (LST)&quot;,&quot;Year&quot;,&quot;Month&quot;,&quot;Day&quot;,&quot;Time (LST)&quot;,&quot;Temp (C)&quot;,&quot;Temp Flag&quot;,&quot;Dew Point Temp (°C)&quot;,&quot;Dew Point Temp Flag&quot;,&quot;Rel Hum (%)&quot;,&quot;Rel Hum Flag&quot;,&quot;Precip.

Data may be incomplete. Your program must handle two possibilities.\nFirst, a line from the csv file may be incomplete, such as in the file for February 2021,\nwhere the weather data ends on &quot;2021-02-15 23:00”, but the remaining hours to the end\nof the month appear in the file with the weather data missing. Here’s how your program\nshould handle this:</p>\n<pre><code>$ java TemperatureStats Temperatures_Feb2021.csv\ninvalid entry at 2021-02-16 00:00\ninvalid entry at 2021-02-16 01:00\ninvalid entry at 2021-02-16 02:00\n...\ninvalid entry at 2021-02-28 22:00\ninvalid entry at 2021-02-28 23:00\nMaximum: 2021-02-03 16:00: 2.6\nMinimum: 2021-02-10 08:00: -23.0\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that date and time for each line with missing data is identified (not all data is shown\nhere to keep the output short for the assignment document). The second way data may be\nincomplete is that a value may be missing, (an empty string, i.e. &quot; &quot;) shows up in the\ntemperature column, instead a value (such as &quot;-14.3&quot;). In the following example, the first\ntemperature in the January file was removed and replaced with &quot; &quot; (and saved in a file\ncalled Temperatures_Jan2021_Test.csv), which is handled in the same way as the first\nissue by identifying the line with an invalid entry:</p>\n<pre><code>$ java TemperatureStats Temperatures_Jan2021_Test.csv\ninvalid entry at 2021-01-01 00:00\nMaximum: 2021-01-15 15:00: 3.1\nMinimum: 2021-01-31 08:00: -19.3\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm trying to get the output right first, so I'm not adding exceptions.\nThe problem I am having is that the csv file cannot be read\nthis is my code</p>\n<pre><code>\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.FileNotFoundException;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\nimport static java.util.Arrays.stream;\n\npublic class TemperatureParser {\n    String time;\n    String temp;\n\n\n    public TemperatureParser() {\n        String time;\n        String temp;\n    }\n    static TemperatureParser[] weatherList;\n\n    public void setTime(String t) {\n        this.time = t;\n    }\n\n    public void setTemp(String temp) {\n        this.temp = temp;\n    }\n\n    public String getTemp() {\n        return temp;\n    }\n\n    public String getTime() {\n        return time;\n    }\n\n    public static void parsing(String file) throws FileNotFoundException {\n\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File(file));\n        Scanner valueScan = null;\n        Scanner headScan = null;\n        int index = 0;\n        int ii=0;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 30; i++) {\n            headScan = new Scanner(sc.nextLine());\n            headScan.useDelimiter(&quot;,&quot;);\n            String useless =headScan.nextLine();\n        }\n\n        while (sc.hasNextLine()) {\n\n            valueScan = new Scanner(sc.nextLine());\n            valueScan.useDelimiter(&quot;,&quot;);\n            TemperatureParser parser = new TemperatureParser();\n            while (valueScan.hasNext()) {\n                String data = valueScan.next();\n                if (index == 5) {\n                    parser.setTime(data);\n                } else if (index == 10) {\n                    parser.setTemp(data);\n                }\n                index++;\n            }\n            index = 0;\n            weatherList[ii]=(parser);\n            ii++;\n        }\n        sc.close();\n    }\n    public double[] getTempArray(){\n        double[] tempArray = new double[weatherList.length];\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; weatherList.length; i++) {\n            tempArray[i]=Double.valueOf(weatherList[i].temp);\n        }\n        return tempArray;\n    }\n    public double max(){\n        return stream(getTempArray()).max().getAsDouble();\n    }\n    public double min(){\n        return stream(getTempArray()).min().getAsDouble();\n    }\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>import java.io.FileNotFoundException;\npublic class TemperatureStats {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {\n        TemperatureParser parser = new TemperatureParser();\n        parser.parsing(args[0]);\n        System.out.println(parser.max());\n        System.out.println(parser.min());\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","web-applications","web","jakarta-mail","registration"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1362225,"reputation":5088,"user_id":1299376,"accept_rate":69,"display_name":"Susie"},"score":0,"creation_date":1387920475,"post_id":20766044,"comment_id":31124669,"body_markdown":"@Caadi0 Thanks for your comment.

That way no methods can be called on a null view, as these are called after it is created.\r\n\r\nSecondly, you need to sort out your activities and with what you&#39;re exactly trying to achieve. \r\n\r\nYou want a page viewer and a fragmentlist.

Following this convention is a good coding practice that can save you headaches on larger projects.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here's your edited Pet class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Pet {\n    String Name, AdoptionStatus, True = \"not adopted\";\n    int Age;\n\n    public Pet() {}\n\n    public Pet(String Name, int Age) {\n        this.Name = Name;\n        this.Age = Age;\n    }\n\n    public void SetName(String namesetup) {\n        Name = namesetup;\n    }\n\n    public String GetName() {\n        return Name;\n    }\n\n    public int GetAge() {\n        return Age;\n    }\n\n    public int ageincrease() {\n        return Age++;\n    }\n\n    public String Getadoptionstatus() {\n        return AdoptionStatus;\n    }\n\n    public void Setadoptionstatus(String setadoption2) {\n        AdoptionStatus = True;\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here's what I replaced the your while loop with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int flag = 0;\n    while(flag != -1) {\n        switch(Userinput) {\n            case \"A\": \n                System.out.println(\"Fido is \"+Pet1.GetAge()+ \" years old and is \" + Pet1.Getadoptionstatus());\n                System.out.println(\"furball is \" + Pet2.GetAge()+ \" years old and is \" + Pet2.Getadoptionstatus());\n                Userinput=scan.nextLine();\n                break;\n            case \"B\":\n                System.out.println(\"Everyone just got a little older.\");\n                Pet1.ageincrease();//Still keeps Pet1 age to 3\n                Pet2.ageincrease();//Still keeps Pet2 age to 1\n                System.out.println(Pet1.GetAge() + \" \" + Pet2.GetAge());\n                Userinput=scan.nextLine();\n                break;\n            case \"C\":\n                System.out.println(\"Please type in a name\");\n                Pet3name=scan.nextLine();\n                System.out.println(\"Please type in an age\");\n                Pet3age=scan.nextInt();\n                Userinput=scan.nextLine();\n                break;\n            case \"D\":\n                //Not sure how you want to implement this\n                break;\n            case \"E\":\n                flag = -1;\n                break;\n            }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":11942470,"reputation":29,"user_id":8738809,"accept_rate":33,"display_name":"Pathlessodin"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":46626338,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1666128936,"creation_date":1507416017,"question_id":46625805,"body_markdown":"I set up a method to increase the age of a Pet by 1 each time its called upon but for some reason, it is giving me the age originally set.\r\n\r\nHere is the file with my methods and classes listed:\r\n```\r\npublic class Pet\r\n{\r\n    String Name;\r\n    int Age;\r\n    String AdoptionStatus;\r\n    String True=&quot;not adopted&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    public Pet(){\r\n       \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public Pet(String Name,int Age){\r\n       this.Name=Name;\r\n       this.Age=Age;\r\n\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public void SetName(String namesetup){\r\n       \r\n       namesetup=Name;\r\n       \r\n       \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public String GetName(){\r\n       \r\n        return Name;\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public int GetAge(){\r\n        \r\n        return Age;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public int ageincrease(){\r\n        \r\n        return Age+1;\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public String Getadoptionstatus(){\r\n        \r\n        return AdoptionStatus;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public void Setadoptionstatus(String setadoption2){\r\n       \r\n       AdoptionStatus=True;\r\n       \r\n       \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHere is the other class where the ageincrease() is called but ends up giving me zero:\r\n```\r\npublic class MainPets\r\n{\r\n    static Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n\r\n    private static String Userinput;\r\n\r\n    private static void mainmenu(){\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;A.&quot;+&quot;

However, as soon as I changed my jdk to JDK-11, it generates the date in format `Jan 3, 2022, 9:12:28 PM`. So there is a difference of `comma after 2022` in the output. My test case is failing due to this mismatch.
