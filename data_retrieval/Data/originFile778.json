For instance, say you wanted a collection of buttons that represented the months of the year, you could start with an array of Month names, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate static final String[] MONTHS = { \r\n\t\t&quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, &quot;March&quot;, &quot;April&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, \r\n\t\t&quot;June&quot;, &quot;July&quot;, &quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;, &quot;October&quot;, \r\n\t\t&quot;November&quot;, &quot;December&quot; };\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then iterate through this array, creating buttons that display the names from the array:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (String month : MONTHS) {\r\n\tJButton button = new JButton(month);\r\n\tsomeJPanel.add(button);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem that you&#39;re going to run into is, how to figure out which button was pressed, an important bit of information. This can be solved in many ways, the simplest is to pass the String of interest to the button&#39;s ActionListener. These listeners can be created &quot;in-line&quot; using a lambda expression like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (String month : MONTHS) {\r\n\tJButton button = new JButton(month);\r\n\tbutton.addActionListener(e -&gt; monthButtonListener(month));\r\n\tsomeJPanel.add(button);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis lambda calls a method, `monthButtonListener(...)` that gets the button&#39;s text via a String parameter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate void monthButtonListener(String month) {\r\n\t// the month name is passed into the parameter and can be used however desired\r\n\t// here as an example, by printing out the String:\r\n\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Month selected: &quot; + month);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother common way to get the button&#39;s text is via its action listener&#39;s &quot;action command&quot; property which can be obtained from the ActionEvent parameter that is passed into the listener&#39;s actionPerformed method, like so:\r\n\r\nAgain, create the buttons, but this time, pass the ActionEvent parameter into the monthButtonListener:\r\n```\r\nfor (String month : MONTHS) {\r\n\tJButton button = new JButton(month);\r\n\tbutton.addActionListener(e -&gt; monthButtonListener(e));\r\n\tadd(button);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen change the monthButtonListener method to accept an ActionEvent parameter and extract its action command property:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate void monthButtonListener(ActionEvent e) {\r\n\t// can also get the button&#39;s text as its &quot;actionCommand&quot;:\r\n\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Button text: &quot; + e.getActionCommand());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA small demonstration program could like something like so:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport java.awt.*;\r\nimport java.awt.event.*;\r\nimport javax.swing.*;\r\n\r\n@SuppressWarnings(&quot;serial&quot;)\r\npublic class ButtonFoo01 extends JPanel {\r\n    private static final String[] MONTHS = { \r\n            &quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, &quot;March&quot;, &quot;April&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, \r\n            &quot;June&quot;, &quot;July&quot;, &quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;, &quot;October&quot;, \r\n            &quot;November&quot;, &quot;December&quot; };\r\n    \r\n    public ButtonFoo01() {\r\n        int gap = 3;\r\n        setLayout(new GridLayout(0, 4, gap, gap));\r\n        setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(gap, gap, gap, gap));\r\n        \r\n        for (String month : MONTHS) {\r\n            JButton button = new JButton(month);\r\n            button.addActionListener(e -&gt; monthButtonListener(e));\r\n            add(button);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    private void monthButtonListener(ActionEvent e) {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Button text: &quot; + e.getActionCommand());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -&gt; {\r\n            ButtonFoo01 mainPanel = new ButtonFoo01();\r\n\r\n            JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;GUI&quot;);\r\n            frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\r\n            frame.add(mainPanel);\r\n            frame.pack();\r\n            frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\r\n            frame.setVisible(true);\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou also can see another example of mine that uses a 2-dimensional array of Strings to help create a GUI calculator,\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nin my answer here:\r\n\r\n[Java JComponent paint --Almost working](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20037116/522444)\r\n_____________________________________________________\r\nBut...\r\n=====\r\n\r\nHaving answered the direct question, one also has to consider the overall problem, that of creating an accurate calendar representation using a Swing GUI, a problem that involves calendar logic that is well-suited to use of the relatively new DateTime Java library. This library makes it fairly easy to create a combo box for months since one can use the library&#39;s Month enum as the data nucleus of the JComboBox:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate JComboBox&lt;Month&gt; monthCombo = new JComboBox&lt;&gt;(Month.values());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe year could  be represented by a JSpinner, one that uses a SpinnerNumberModel that has been set to the desired starting and ending year:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate JSpinner yearSpinner = new JSpinner(new SpinnerNumberModel(2022, 1900, 3000, 1));\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would also change the spinner&#39;s editor so that it doesn&#39;t display a thousands comma delimiter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJSpinner.NumberEditor editor = new JSpinner.NumberEditor(yearSpinner, &quot;#&quot;);\r\nyearSpinner.setEditor(editor);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, we can add the same listener to the JComboBox as to the JSpinner, one that takes both values and finds the correct month for the selected year:\r\n\r\n```\r\nyearSpinner.addChangeListener(ce -&gt; dateChanged());\r\nmonthCombo.addItemListener(ie -&gt; dateChanged());\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith the `dateChanged()` method:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate void dateChanged() {\r\n\tint year = (int) yearSpinner.getValue();\r\n\tMonth month = (Month) monthCombo.getSelectedItem();\r\n\tLocalDate date = LocalDate.of(year, month, 1);\r\n\t\r\n\t// this notifies the JPanel that displays the dates of the selected month and year\r\n\tdaysOfMonthPanel.setDate(date);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn example program could look something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport java.awt.*;\r\nimport java.awt.event.MouseAdapter;\r\nimport java.awt.event.MouseEvent;\r\nimport java.time.*;\r\nimport java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;\r\nimport java.time.format.TextStyle;\r\nimport java.util.Locale;\r\nimport javax.swing.*;\r\n\r\n@SuppressWarnings(&quot;serial&quot;)\r\npublic class CalendarGui extends JPanel {\r\n    public static final String LOCAL_DATE = &quot;local date&quot;;\r\n    private JSpinner yearSpinner = new JSpinner(new SpinnerNumberModel(2022, 1900, 3000, 1));\r\n    private JComboBox&lt;Month&gt; monthCombo = new JComboBox&lt;&gt;(Month.values());\r\n    private DaysOfTheMonthPanel daysOfMonthPanel = new DaysOfTheMonthPanel();\r\n\r\n    public CalendarGui() {\r\n        JSpinner.NumberEditor editor = new JSpinner.NumberEditor(yearSpinner, &quot;#&quot;);\r\n        yearSpinner.setEditor(editor);\r\n        yearSpinner.addChangeListener(ce -&gt; dateChanged());\r\n        monthCombo.addItemListener(ie -&gt; dateChanged());\r\n        monthCombo.setRenderer(new MonthComboEditor());\r\n        yearSpinner.setMaximumSize(yearSpinner.getPreferredSize());\r\n        monthCombo.setMaximumSize(monthCombo.getPreferredSize());\r\n\r\n        JPanel topPanel = new JPanel();\r\n        topPanel.setLayout(new BoxLayout(topPanel, BoxLayout.LINE_AXIS));\r\n        topPanel.add(yearSpinner);\r\n        topPanel.add(Box.createHorizontalGlue());\r\n        topPanel.add(monthCombo);\r\n        \r\n        JPanel middlePanel = new JPanel(new BorderLayout());\r\n        middlePanel.add(new DaysOfTheWeekPanel(), BorderLayout.PAGE_START);\r\n        middlePanel.add(daysOfMonthPanel);        \r\n\r\n        int gap = 3;\r\n        setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(gap, gap, gap, gap));\r\n        setLayout(new BorderLayout(gap, gap));\r\n        add(topPanel, BorderLayout.PAGE_START);\r\n        add(middlePanel);\r\n        \r\n        LocalDate now = LocalDate.now();\r\n        yearSpinner.setValue(now.getYear());\r\n        monthCombo.setSelectedItem(now.getMonth());\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    private void dateChanged() {\r\n        int year = (int) yearSpinner.getValue();\r\n        Month month = (Month) monthCombo.getSelectedItem();\r\n        LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(year, month, 1);\r\n        \r\n        // this notifies the JPanel that displays the dates of the selected month and year\r\n        daysOfMonthPanel.setDate(date);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {        \r\n        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -&gt; {\r\n            CalendarGui mainPanel = new CalendarGui();\r\n\r\n            JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;GUI&quot;);\r\n            frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\r\n            frame.add(mainPanel);\r\n            frame.pack();\r\n            frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\r\n            frame.setVisible(true);\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static class MonthComboEditor extends DefaultListCellRenderer {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public Component getListCellRendererComponent(JList&lt;?&gt; list, Object value, int index, boolean isSelected,\r\n                boolean cellHasFocus) {\r\n            String newValue = (value == null) ?

These listeners can be created &quot;in-line&quot; using a lambda expression like so:</p>\n<pre><code>for (String month : MONTHS) {\n    JButton button = new JButton(month);\n    button.addActionListener(e -&gt; monthButtonListener(month));\n    someJPanel.add(button);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This lambda calls a method, <code>monthButtonListener(...)</code> that gets the button's text via a String parameter:</p>\n<pre><code>private void monthButtonListener(String month) {\n    // the month name is passed into the parameter and can be used however desired\n    // here as an example, by printing out the String:\n    System.out.println(&quot;Month selected: &quot; + month);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another common way to get the button's text is via its action listener's &quot;action command&quot; property which can be obtained from the ActionEvent parameter that is passed into the listener's actionPerformed method, like so:</p>\n<p>Again, create the buttons, but this time, pass the ActionEvent parameter into the monthButtonListener:</p>\n<pre><code>for (String month : MONTHS) {\n    JButton button = new JButton(month);\n    button.addActionListener(e -&gt; monthButtonListener(e));\n    add(button);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then change the monthButtonListener method to accept an ActionEvent parameter and extract its action command property:</p>\n<pre><code>private void monthButtonListener(ActionEvent e) {\n    // can also get the button's text as its &quot;actionCommand&quot;:\n    System.out.println(&quot;Button text: &quot; + e.getActionCommand());\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>A small demonstration program could like something like so:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YCSPu.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YCSPu.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<pre><code>import java.awt.*;\nimport java.awt.event.*;\nimport javax.swing.*;\n\n@SuppressWarnings(&quot;serial&quot;)\npublic class ButtonFoo01 extends JPanel {\n    private static final String[] MONTHS = { \n            &quot;January&quot;, &quot;February&quot;, &quot;March&quot;, &quot;April&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, \n            &quot;June&quot;, &quot;July&quot;, &quot;August&quot;, &quot;September&quot;, &quot;October&quot;, \n            &quot;November&quot;, &quot;December&quot; };\n    \n    public ButtonFoo01() {\n        int gap = 3;\n        setLayout(new GridLayout(0, 4, gap, gap));\n        setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(gap, gap, gap, gap));\n        \n        for (String month : MONTHS) {\n            JButton button = new JButton(month);\n            button.addActionListener(e -&gt; monthButtonListener(e));\n            add(button);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    private void monthButtonListener(ActionEvent e) {\n        System.out.println(&quot;Button text: &quot; + e.getActionCommand());\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -&gt; {\n            ButtonFoo01 mainPanel = new ButtonFoo01();\n\n            JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;GUI&quot;);\n            frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n            frame.add(mainPanel);\n            frame.pack();\n            frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\n            frame.setVisible(true);\n        });\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You also can see another example of mine that uses a 2-dimensional array of Strings to help create a GUI calculator,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RIuvA.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RIuvA.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>in my answer here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/20037116/522444\">Java JComponent paint --Almost working</a></p>\n<hr />\n<h1>But...</h1>\n<p>Having answered the direct question, one also has to consider the overall problem, that of creating an accurate calendar representation using a Swing GUI, a problem that involves calendar logic that is well-suited to use of the relatively new DateTime Java library. This library makes it fairly easy to create a combo box for months since one can use the library's Month enum as the data nucleus of the JComboBox:</p>\n<pre><code>private JComboBox&lt;Month&gt; monthCombo = new JComboBox&lt;&gt;(Month.values());\n</code></pre>\n<p>The year could  be represented by a JSpinner, one that uses a SpinnerNumberModel that has been set to the desired starting and ending year:</p>\n<pre><code>private JSpinner yearSpinner = new JSpinner(new SpinnerNumberModel(2022, 1900, 3000, 1));\n</code></pre>\n<p>I would also change the spinner's editor so that it doesn't display a thousands comma delimiter:</p>\n<pre><code>JSpinner.NumberEditor editor = new JSpinner.NumberEditor(yearSpinner, &quot;#&quot;);\nyearSpinner.setEditor(editor);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also, we can add the same listener to the JComboBox as to the JSpinner, one that takes both values and finds the correct month for the selected year:</p>\n<pre><code>yearSpinner.addChangeListener(ce -&gt; dateChanged());\nmonthCombo.addItemListener(ie -&gt; dateChanged());\n</code></pre>\n<p>with the <code>dateChanged()</code> method:</p>\n<pre><code>private void dateChanged() {\n    int year = (int) yearSpinner.getValue();\n    Month month = (Month) monthCombo.getSelectedItem();\n    LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(year, month, 1);\n    \n    // this notifies the JPanel that displays the dates of the selected month and year\n    daysOfMonthPanel.setDate(date);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>An example program could look something like:</p>\n<pre><code>import java.awt.*;\nimport java.awt.event.MouseAdapter;\nimport java.awt.event.MouseEvent;\nimport java.time.*;\nimport java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;\nimport java.time.format.TextStyle;\nimport java.util.Locale;\nimport javax.swing.*;\n\n@SuppressWarnings(&quot;serial&quot;)\npublic class CalendarGui extends JPanel {\n    public static final String LOCAL_DATE = &quot;local date&quot;;\n    private JSpinner yearSpinner = new JSpinner(new SpinnerNumberModel(2022, 1900, 3000, 1));\n    private JComboBox&lt;Month&gt; monthCombo = new JComboBox&lt;&gt;(Month.values());\n    private DaysOfTheMonthPanel daysOfMonthPanel = new DaysOfTheMonthPanel();\n\n    public CalendarGui() {\n        JSpinner.NumberEditor editor = new JSpinner.NumberEditor(yearSpinner, &quot;#&quot;);\n        yearSpinner.setEditor(editor);\n        yearSpinner.addChangeListener(ce -&gt; dateChanged());\n        monthCombo.addItemListener(ie -&gt; dateChanged());\n        monthCombo.setRenderer(new MonthComboEditor());\n        yearSpinner.setMaximumSize(yearSpinner.getPreferredSize());\n        monthCombo.setMaximumSize(monthCombo.getPreferredSize());\n\n        JPanel topPanel = new JPanel();\n        topPanel.setLayout(new BoxLayout(topPanel, BoxLayout.LINE_AXIS));\n        topPanel.add(yearSpinner);\n        topPanel.add(Box.createHorizontalGlue());\n        topPanel.add(monthCombo);\n        \n        JPanel middlePanel = new JPanel(new BorderLayout());\n        middlePanel.add(new DaysOfTheWeekPanel(), BorderLayout.PAGE_START);\n        middlePanel.add(daysOfMonthPanel);        \n\n        int gap = 3;\n        setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(gap, gap, gap, gap));\n        setLayout(new BorderLayout(gap, gap));\n        add(topPanel, BorderLayout.PAGE_START);\n        add(middlePanel);\n        \n        LocalDate now = LocalDate.now();\n        yearSpinner.setValue(now.getYear());\n        monthCombo.setSelectedItem(now.getMonth());\n    }\n    \n    private void dateChanged() {\n        int year = (int) yearSpinner.getValue();\n        Month month = (Month) monthCombo.getSelectedItem();\n        LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(year, month, 1);\n        \n        // this notifies the JPanel that displays the dates of the selected month and year\n        daysOfMonthPanel.setDate(date);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {        \n        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -&gt; {\n            CalendarGui mainPanel = new CalendarGui();\n\n            JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;GUI&quot;);\n            frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n            frame.add(mainPanel);\n            frame.pack();\n            frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\n            frame.setVisible(true);\n        });\n    }\n\n    private static class MonthComboEditor extends DefaultListCellRenderer {\n        @Override\n        public Component getListCellRendererComponent(JList&lt;?&gt; list, Object value, int index, boolean isSelected,\n                boolean cellHasFocus) {\n            String newValue = (value == null) ?

This combination will determine in which day of the week does de first and last day of the month goes.\r\n\r\nThe problem I have with the code I made is with using the Calendar day button&#39;s names as variables. Maybe there is a way to prepare a statement for NetBeans to read as the buttons name?\r\n\r\nFor this calendar, I made a JPanel with 49 buttons (to have 7 rows of weeks that is the maximum a calendar has). I tried to name every button &quot;N(number)&quot; (the number being from 1 to 49). This is so I can make a for function that makes so that the position of the day after the last day of a month will be the position for the first day of the following month.\r\n\r\n[Image of the JPanel](https://i.stack.imgur.com/t8rCT.png) \r\n\r\nThe code for this would start from January 2022 (without counting leap-years). The year of the Calendar has to be specified in the &quot;YearC&quot; variable (int his case its 2022). Another value also has to be specified is the number of empty position in the calendar before the first day of the year in the &quot;FirstD&quot; variable (in the case of January 2022 it&#39;s 5).

This combination will determine in which day of the week does de first and last day of the month goes.</p>\n<p>The problem I have with the code I made is with using the Calendar day button's names as variables. Maybe there is a way to prepare a statement for NetBeans to read as the buttons name?</p>\n<p>For this calendar, I made a JPanel with 49 buttons (to have 7 rows of weeks that is the maximum a calendar has). I tried to name every button &quot;N(number)&quot; (the number being from 1 to 49). This is so I can make a for function that makes so that the position of the day after the last day of a month will be the position for the first day of the following month.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/t8rCT.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Image of the JPanel</a></p>\n<p>The code for this would start from January 2022 (without counting leap-years). The year of the Calendar has to be specified in the &quot;YearC&quot; variable (int his case its 2022). Another value also has to be specified is the number of empty position in the calendar before the first day of the year in the &quot;FirstD&quot; variable (in the case of January 2022 it's 5). Finally, I used a spinner for the months because the user has to se the months consecutively for the code to work.</p>\n<p>The code is the following:</p>\n<pre><code>    public void WeekPos(){\n        String MonIntCal = MonthCal.getValue().toString();\n        int DayN = 0;\n        int jub = 0;\n        int DayC = 0;\n        int FirstD = 6;\n        String YearC = &quot;2022&quot;;\n        YearCal.setText(YearC);\n        String Nam = &quot;B&quot;+DayC;\n        int LastJan = 0;\n        int LastFeb = 0;\n        int LastMar = 0;\n        int LastApr = 0;\n        int LastMay = 0;\n        int LastJun = 0;\n        int LastJul = 0;\n        int LastAug = 0;\n        int LastSep = 0;\n        int LastOct = 0;\n        int LastNov = 0;\n        \n        switch(MonIntCal){\n            case &quot;January&quot;: DayN = 31;

The String is already known at compile time, and they are interned.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2465781,"reputation":1582,"user_id":2148913,"accept_rate":80,"display_name":"Ajeesh"},"score":3,"creation_date":1382008564,"post_id":19418548,"comment_id":28797595,"body_markdown":"**intern()** strings are not garbage collected and it&#39;s stored in permgen space which is low so you will be get into trouble like **out of memory error** if not used properly.","body":"<b>intern()</b> strings are not garbage collected and it&#39;s stored in permgen space which is low so you will be get into trouble like <b>out of memory error</b> if not used properly."},{"owner":{"account_id":47283,"reputation":703927,"user_id":139985,"accept_rate":69,"display_name":"Stephen C"},"score":1,"creation_date":1497609892,"post_id":19418548,"comment_id":76162238,"body_markdown":"@Ajeesh - Interned strings can be garbage collected.

Expected: a message \"hello {username}\" is displayed next to \"Received Message To Me Only\" for this user only, Actual: nothing is received</p>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":39976,"reputation":5421,"user_id":115589,"accept_rate":40,"display_name":"Wernsey"},"score":2,"creation_date":1257321452,"post_id":1672281,"comment_id":1545610,"body_markdown":"Which environment variables?

Note how this repository interface extends the <code>Custom</code> one:</p>\n<pre><code>@Transactional\npublic interface MyObjectRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;MyObject, Integer&gt;, MyObjectRepositoryCustom {\n\n    List&lt;MyObject&gt; findByName(String name);\n\n    @Query(&quot;select * from my_object where name = ?0 or middle_name = ?0&quot;)\n    List&lt;MyObject&gt; findByFirstNameOrMiddleName(String name);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>MyObjectRepositoryCustom</code> - repository methods that are more complex and cannot be handled with a simple query or an annotation:</p>\n<pre><code>public interface MyObjectRepositoryCustom {\n\n    List&lt;MyObject&gt; findByNameWithWeirdOrdering(String name);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>MyObjectRepositoryCustomImpl</code> - where you actually implement those methods with an autowired <code>EntityManager</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>public class MyObjectRepositoryCustomImpl implements MyObjectRepositoryCustom {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private EntityManager entityManager;\n\n    public final List&lt;MyObject&gt; findByNameWithWeirdOrdering(String name) {\n        Query query = query(where(&quot;name&quot;).is(name));\n        query.sort().on(&quot;whatever&quot;, Order.ASC);\n        return entityManager.find(query, MyObject.class);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Amazingly, this all comes together and methods from both interfaces (and the CRUD interface, you implement) all show up when you do:</p>\n<pre><code>myObjectRepository.\n</code></pre>\n<p>You will see:</p>\n<pre><code>myObjectRepository.save()\nmyObjectRepository.findAll()\nmyObjectRepository.findByName()\nmyObjectRepository.findByFirstNameOrMiddleName()\nmyObjectRepository.findByNameWithWeirdOrdering()\n</code></pre>\n<p>It really does work. And you get one interface for querying. <code>spring-data</code> really is ready for a large application. And the more queries you can push into simple or annotation only the better off you are.</p>\n<p>All of this is documented at the <a href=\"http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-jpa/docs/1.4.x/reference/htmlsingle/#repositories.custom-implementations\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Spring Data Jpa site</a>.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1578490,"reputation":4780,"user_id":1464389,"accept_rate":49,"display_name":"F.O.O"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":false,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1439361352,"creation_date":1439361352,"answer_id":31957662,"question_id":12790853,"body_markdown":"Spring JPA will provide you a lot of abstraction from writing SQL and even some HQL using query method declaration.

Previously, all code was able to bind any socket type to any port number greater than or equal to 1024. It is still possible to bind sockets to the ephemeral port range on each system. The exact range of ephemeral ports varies from one operating system to another, but it is typically in the high range (such as from 49152 to 65535).

I am not familiar with *nix and Mac conventions, but on Windows there is no \"home folder\" and the application has to specify whether it wants to store stuff in the <em>roaming profile</em> (<code>C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\&lt;application vendor&gt;\\&lt;application name&gt;\\</code> by default) or the <em>local profile</em> (<code>C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\AppData\\Local\\&lt;application vendor&gt;\\&lt;application name&gt;\\</code> by default).</p>\n\n<p>Note that you cannot hardcode these paths, because on a networked installation they might be somewhere else. You shouldn't rely on environment variables either because they can be modified by the user. Your application should call the <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb762188%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">SHGetKnownFolderPath</a> function of the Windows API.</p>\n\n<p>The difference between the two is that the local profile is specific to the user and the machine, while the roaming profile is specific to the user, so in a setup like my university, stuff apps put in the roaming profile are uploaded to the server and synced to whichever computer I log in to.</p>\n\n<p>It should be the responsibility of applications to choose whether the settings they want to store are local or roaming.

Analysis that incorporates memory characteristics is a big topic in itself.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":8936119,"reputation":546,"user_id":6666894,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"dibugger"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":2696,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":40700475,"answer_count":3,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1672086793,"creation_date":1479611157,"question_id":40700270,"body_markdown":"Suppose I have a class:\r\n`\r\n\r\n    public class Interval {\r\n        int start;\r\n        int end;\r\n        Interval() { start = 0; end = 0; }\r\n        Interval(int s, int e) { start = s; end = e; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n`\r\n\r\nI would like to sort a list of intervals with Collections.sort() like this:\r\n\r\n    Collections.sort(intervals, new Comparator&lt;Interval&gt;(){\r\n        @Override\r\n        public int compare(Interval o1, Interval o2) {\r\n            if (o1.start == o2.start) {\r\n                return o1.end - o2.end;\r\n            }\r\n            else {\r\n                return o1.start - o2.start;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\nI know that sorting an array with the built-in sorting function takes O(nlogn) time, and the question is if I am sorting a list of objects with two properties, what is the time complexity of sorting this list?

Mockito will not be able to inject the correct mocks.\r\n\r\nAnd here&#39;s how you would write the test as a Spring test with mock beans:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)\r\npublic class ProcessorFacTest\r\n{\r\n    @MockBean\r\n    ProcessorType1 processor1;\r\n    @MockBean\r\n    ProcessorType2 processor2;\r\n    // ...\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    ProcessorFactory factory;\r\n\r\n    @BeforeEach // JUnit 5\r\n    // @Before  // JUnit 4\r\n    void setup() {\r\n      Mockito.when(processor1.getType()).thenReturn(Type.TYPE1.getValue());\r\n      Mockito.when(processor2.getType()).thenReturn(Type.TYPE2.getValue());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void testGetSyncProcessorDocument() {\r\n        String type = Type.TYPE1.getValue();\r\n        Processor processor = ProcessorFactory.getProcessor(type);\r\n        Assert.assertTrue(processor instanceof ProcessorType1);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut actually you don&#39;t need to use any annotations here, you could wire the dependencies manually just as simple:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class ProcessorFacTest\r\n{\r\n    ProcessorFactory factory;\r\n\r\n    @BeforeEach // JUnit 5\r\n    // @Before  // JUnit 4\r\n    void setup() {\r\n      final ProcessorType1 processor1 = Mockito.mock(ProcessorType1.class);\r\n      final ProcessorType1 processor2 = Mockito.mock(ProcessorType2.class);\r\n      Mockito.when(processor1.getType()).thenReturn(Type.TYPE1);\r\n      Mockito.when(processor2.getType()).thenReturn(Type.TYPE2);\r\n\r\n      factory = new ProcessorFactory(\r\n          List.of(\r\n              processor1,\r\n              processor2,\r\n              // ...\r\n          ));\r\n    }    \r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void testGetSyncProcessorDocument() {\r\n        String type = Type.TYPE1.getValue();\r\n        Processor processor = ProcessorFactory.getProcessor(type);\r\n        Assert.assertTrue(processor instanceof ProcessorType1);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf your processors are simply, easy to instantiate and don&#39;t depend on other classes, it might even be simpler (and better, YMMV) to simply use the real collaborators instead of mocks.\r\n\r\nAnd it might be easier to create a test implementation of your processor type, which can be easier to set up than a mock object created dynamically with Mockito. The code would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @BeforeEach // JUnit 5\r\n    // @Before  // JUnit 4\r\n    void setup() {\r\n      factory = new ProcessorFactory(\r\n          List.of(\r\n              new TestProcessor(Type.TYPE1),\r\n              new TestProcessor(Type.TYPE2),\r\n              // ...\r\n          ));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static class TestProcessor extends Processor {\r\n      private final Type type;\r\n      public TestProcessor(final Type type) { this.type = type; }\r\n      public String getType() { return type.getValue(); }\r\n\r\n      // Base class methods do nothing already. If they were, you would override them here with an empty implementation:\r\n      @Override\r\n      public void transformInput(JsonObject data) { /* do nothing */ }\r\n      @Override\r\n      public void buildOutputRequest(String syncType) { /* do nothing */ }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNB. It&#39;s bad practice to use names that are already defined in the JDK. `Type` is one such name ([`java.lang.reflect.Type`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Type.html)).\r\n\r\nIt might also be worthwhile to read https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74027324/why-is-my-class-not-calling-my-mocked-methods-in-unit-test to get a good overview of common gotchas when setting up mocks.","title":"Mocking of component with InjectMocks is not working for my test class","body":"<p>You never define any mocks that could be injected.

Mockito will not be able to inject the correct mocks.</p>\n<p>And here's how you would write the test as a Spring test with mock beans:</p>\n<pre><code>@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)\npublic class ProcessorFacTest\n{\n    @MockBean\n    ProcessorType1 processor1;\n    @MockBean\n    ProcessorType2 processor2;\n    // ...\n\n    @Autowired\n    ProcessorFactory factory;\n\n    @BeforeEach // JUnit 5\n    // @Before  // JUnit 4\n    void setup() {\n      Mockito.when(processor1.getType()).thenReturn(Type.TYPE1.getValue());\n      Mockito.when(processor2.getType()).thenReturn(Type.TYPE2.getValue());\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    void testGetSyncProcessorDocument() {\n        String type = Type.TYPE1.getValue();\n        Processor processor = ProcessorFactory.getProcessor(type);\n        Assert.assertTrue(processor instanceof ProcessorType1);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>But actually you don't need to use any annotations here, you could wire the dependencies manually just as simple:</p>\n<pre><code>public class ProcessorFacTest\n{\n    ProcessorFactory factory;\n\n    @BeforeEach // JUnit 5\n    // @Before  // JUnit 4\n    void setup() {\n      final ProcessorType1 processor1 = Mockito.mock(ProcessorType1.class);\n      final ProcessorType1 processor2 = Mockito.mock(ProcessorType2.class);\n      Mockito.when(processor1.getType()).thenReturn(Type.TYPE1);\n      Mockito.when(processor2.getType()).thenReturn(Type.TYPE2);\n\n      factory = new ProcessorFactory(\n          List.of(\n              processor1,\n              processor2,\n              // ...\n          ));\n    }    \n\n    @Test\n    void testGetSyncProcessorDocument() {\n        String type = Type.TYPE1.getValue();\n        Processor processor = ProcessorFactory.getProcessor(type);\n        Assert.assertTrue(processor instanceof ProcessorType1);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If your processors are simply, easy to instantiate and don't depend on other classes, it might even be simpler (and better, YMMV) to simply use the real collaborators instead of mocks.</p>\n<p>And it might be easier to create a test implementation of your processor type, which can be easier to set up than a mock object created dynamically with Mockito. The code would look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>    @BeforeEach // JUnit 5\n    // @Before  // JUnit 4\n    void setup() {\n      factory = new ProcessorFactory(\n          List.of(\n              new TestProcessor(Type.TYPE1),\n              new TestProcessor(Type.TYPE2),\n              // ...\n          ));\n    }\n\n    private static class TestProcessor extends Processor {\n      private final Type type;\n      public TestProcessor(final Type type) { this.type = type; }\n      public String getType() { return type.getValue(); }\n\n      // Base class methods do nothing already. If they were, you would override them here with an empty implementation:\n      @Override\n      public void transformInput(JsonObject data) { /* do nothing */ }\n      @Override\n      public void buildOutputRequest(String syncType) { /* do nothing */ }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>NB. It's bad practice to use names that are already defined in the JDK. <code>Type</code> is one such name (<a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/Type.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>java.lang.reflect.Type</code></a>).</p>\n<p>It might also be worthwhile to read <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74027324/why-is-my-class-not-calling-my-mocked-methods-in-unit-test\">Why is my class not calling my mocked methods in unit test?</a> to get a good overview of common gotchas when setting up mocks.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":12024361,"reputation":2102,"user_id":8796806,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"Timothy Clotworthy"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":921,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1672078679,"creation_date":1672065696,"question_id":74921349,"body_markdown":"I have a spring boot app with autowired components.

The `hasNext()` internal loop is necessary to skip the unwanted items, but it does not add the computational difficulty. The overall difficulty of such iteration is `O(channels.size())`.\r\n\r\nNote that this iterator implementation breaks the `Iterator` interface contract. First it does not throw `NoSuchElementException` at the end of the iteration. Second, if you call `next()` several times without calling `hasNext()` you will have different results. Thus I would not recommend use the samples from this tutorial in the real code.","title":"what is the performance efficient method for iterate java collection?","body":"<p>The performance of <code>Iterator</code> depends on its implementation.
