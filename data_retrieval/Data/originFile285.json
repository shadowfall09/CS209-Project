at StackOverflow (like [this one][1]), I learned that the error is due to the fact that the method `address.getCustomer()` returns a proxy to the `Customer` entity instead of the customer itself, and it turns out that this proxy is not serializable. OK, that&#39;s fine. What I don&#39;t understand is that the method `customer.getAdresses()` is also lazy, but when I request the resource bound to this method, it works perfectly.\r\n\r\nCould anybody explain what is

the error is due to the fact that the method <code>address.getCustomer()</code> returns a proxy to the <code>Customer</code> entity instead of the customer itself, and it turns out that this proxy is not serializable. OK, that's fine. What I don't understand is that the method <code>customer.getAdresses()</code> is also lazy, but when I request the resource bound to this method, it works perfectly.</p>\n<p>Could anybody explain what is actually happening here?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","kotlin","resttemplate","spring-boot-3"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":213468,"reputation":103500,"user_id":466862,"display_name":"Mark Rotteveel"},"score":0,"creation_date":1690388826,"post_id":76773205,"comment_id":135347646,"body_markdown":"The real solution is to let Spring Boot manage your dependencies instead of doing it manually.","body":"The real solution is to let Spring Boot manage your dependencies instead of doing it manually."},{"owner":{"account_id":3163862,"reputation":36940,"user_id":2674303,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"gstackoverflow"},"score":0,"creation_date":1690388877,"post_id":76773205,"comment_id":135347658,"body_markdown":"@Mark Rotteveel could you be a bit more specific please ?","body":"@Mark Rotteveel could you be a bit more specific please ?"},{"owner":{"account_id":213468,"reputation":103500,"user_id":466862,"display_name":"Mark Rotteveel"},"score":0,"creation_date":1690389052,"post_id":76773205,"comment_id":135347708,"body_markdown":"You&#39;re not doing things according to how Spring Boot should be used, if you&#39;d let Spring Boot manage the dependencies, it would either have imported the correct dependencies automatically or you wouldn&#39;t have needed to specify the version of dependencies which Spring Boot manages but does not depend on by default.","body":"You&#39;re not doing things according to how Spring Boot should be used, if you&#39;d let Spring Boot manage the dependencies, it would either have imported the correct dependencies automatically or you wouldn&#39;t have needed to specify the version of dependencies which Spring Boot manages but does not depend on by default."},{"owner":{"account_id":3163862,"reputation":36940,"user_id":2674303,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"gstackoverflow"},"score":0,"creation_date":1690389156,"post_id":76773205,"comment_id":135347727,"body_markdown":"What should I do to let Spring Boot manage my dependencies ? specifically this one","body":"What should I do to let Spring Boot manage my dependencies ? specifically this one"},{"owner":{"account_id":213468,"reputation":103500,"user_id":466862,"display_name":"Mark Rotteveel"},"score":0,"creation_date":1690389633,"post_id":76773205,"comment_id":135347849,"body_markdown":"https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/3.1.2/gradle-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/","body":"<a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/3.1.2/gradle-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/3.1.2/gradle-plugin/referenc&zwnj;&#8203;e/&hellip;</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":3163862,"reputation":36940,"user_id":2674303,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"gstackoverflow"},"score":0,"creation_date":1690389936,"post_id":76773205,"comment_id":135347923,"body_markdown":"Actually I have `plugins {\n    java\n    kotlin(&quot;jvm&quot;)\n    kotlin(&quot;plugin.spring&quot;) version &quot;1.8.21&quot;\n    id(&quot;io.spring.dependency-management&quot;) version &quot;1.1.0&quot;\n`","body":"Actually I have <code>plugins {     java     kotlin(&quot;jvm&quot;)     kotlin(&quot;plugin.spring&quot;) version &quot;1.8.21&quot;     id(&quot;io.spring.dependency-management&quot;) version &quot;1.1.0&quot; </code>"},{"owner":{"account_id":3163862,"reputation":36940,"user_id":2674303,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"gstackoverflow"},"score":0,"creation_date":1690390189,"post_id":76773205,"comment_id":135347981,"body_markdown":"1.

Omitting some of the surrounding classes for brevity, the below is the `App` class that executes the calculator functions and prints the results.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class App {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n\r\n        Calculator calculator = new Calculator(0);\r\n\r\n        calculator\r\n        .execute(OperationType.add, 10)\r\n        .execute(OperationType.add, 20)\r\n        .execute(OperationType.subtract, 15)\r\n        .execute(OperationType.multiply, 3)\r\n        .execute(OperationType.divide, 2)\r\n        .execute(OperationType.multiply, 1000);\r\n\r\n        PrintHandler printer = new PrintHandler(calculator);\r\n        printer.printResults();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    0.0 added to 10.0\r\n    10.0 added to 20.0\r\n    30.0 subtracted by 15.0\r\n    15.0 multiplied by 3.0\r\n    45.0 divided by 2.0\r\n    22.5 multiplied by 1000.0\r\n    -----------\r\n    Total: 22500.0\r\n\r\n\r\n**Question**\r\n\r\nWhile the code does work, the Calculator&#39;s `execute` method still has a large switch statement (code below) that routes to different class instantiation. I was attempting to simplify the `execute` method by abstracting out actual calculations (addition/subtraction) into separate classes, but I&#39;ve basically just moved that logic around rather than bypassing the need for a switch statement. Since this model violates the open-closed solid principle, I&#39;m wondering how I can implement a solution that follows solid principles and doesn&#39;t require the code to be re-opened in the event of adding a new operation type (e.g. Modulo).\r\n\r\n\r\n    public Calculator execute(OperationType operationType, float newValue) throws Exception {\r\n    \r\n        Operation newOperation;\r\n        // Operation is the interface.

How to guarantee that no matter what I type in JTextArea, no matter how big the form is, JTextArea is always guaranteed to be 40% and JList is always guaranteed to be 60%.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/E7gdd.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/E7gdd.png\" alt=\"The interface after first opening the program\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8aITw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8aITw.png\" alt=\"The size of the JTextArea changes after the text is entered\" /></a></p>\n<p>Sometimes, when I maximize the window and minimize it may change for a while, and then for a while JTextArea's broadband will be stretched out again.

Both are set to 1.0, so that the ratio is 50%, but this does not help, the size of the JTextArea will still be widened after entering the text.

Also, we&#39;ll want to use the fact that to reverse\r\n\r\n     angle = Math.atan2(y, x);\r\n\r\nYou generally shouldn&#39;t use the `tan` function, but should instead use:\r\n\r\n     x = Math.cos(angle);\r\n     y = Math.sin(angle);\r\n\r\n     // then multiple x and y by some scaling factor\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n    private static double[] calculateAccelerations(double angleX, double angleY, double angleZ) {\r\n\r\n        // Convertir les angles en radians\r\n        double radianAngleX = angleX * DEG_TO_RAD;\r\n        double radianAngleY = angleY * DEG_TO_RAD;\r\n        double radianAngleZ = angleZ * DEG_TO_RAD;\r\n\r\n        double acX = Math.sin(radianAngleX);\r\n        double acY = Math.sin(radianAngleY);\r\n        double acZ = Math.cos(radianAngleZ);\r\n\r\n        // use this if you need the sum of the acceleration squared to be G squared\r\n        //double scaling = G / Math.sqrt(acX*acX + acY*acY + acZ*acZ);\r\n        // EDIT Cheloute: with scaling = 1, that works perfectly for my use case\r\n        double scaling = 1;\r\n\r\n        return new double[]{acX*scaling, acY*scaling, acZ*scaling};\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote though that although the `calculateAccelerations` function will spit back values for any three input angles, that doesn&#39;t mean that any three angle combinations are actually valid; for example, the way you&#39;ve got your measurements set up, `angleY` is restricted to being between `-abs(abs(angleX)-90)` and `abs(abs(angleX)-90)`, and given `angleX` and `angleY`, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s possible to determine `angleZ` or at least narrow it down to only two possibilities.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you feed `calculateAccelerations` angles that came out of `calculateAngles` you should get back the original accelerations, or close enough.","title":"How to estimate angles from acceleration and acceleration from angles in 3 dimensions?","body":"<p>First off, what do you want your angles to measure?

For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nObject o = 5;\r\n```\r\n\r\n&#39;5&#39; is an expression. Its type is `int`. This is valid java code, but the type of the expression remains `int`; the fact that its being assigned to a variable of type `Object` does not change this. The compiler applies auto-boxing (assumes you meant to write `Object o = Integer.valueOf(5)`), and thus the desugared type of that expression becomes `Integer`, which is a subtype of Object and therefore can be assigned to variable o.\r\n\r\nThe thing about lambdas (`(x, y) -&gt; foo`) and function references (`something::methodName`) is that they, too, are values, and therefore they, too, need to have a type.\r\n\r\nAnd therein lies the rub. Java is designed so that there aren&#39;t generalized functional types. Instead, java checks the context _around_ the method reference or lambda and checks: Which functional interface type is required here? - and then assumes that&#39;s the type that lambda/functional type is meant to have, and __only then__ does the compiler actually parse the content of the lambda/method ref.\r\n\r\nIt has to do it this way, after all, `(x) -&gt; x.toLowerCase().length() &lt; 5` or whatever has to be a compiler error _unless_ the type of `x` is `String` or something else with a `toLowerCase()` method, so to even begin to compile this, the compiler needs to know x is of type `String` but it can&#39;t know that unless the context _around_ the `x -&gt; x.toLowerCase().length() &lt; 5` expression gives the compiler enough info to e.g. infer that the thing is meant to be a `Predicate&lt;String&gt;`.\r\n\r\nThe compiler does this by going inside-out, then outside-in, then inside-out again: First the compiler zooms in on everything and assigns types to it (i.e. in `Object o = 5;`, the compiler zooms in on the 5, it knows what type that is (`int`), and then zooms back out and figures out that auto-boxing is needed) - that&#39;s inside-out.\r\n\r\nWith lambdas/methodrefs, the compiler doesn&#39;t go any further than &#39;some lambda / some methodref, with unknown types&#39; and doesn&#39;t try to parse the content at all. With that info it continues (and e.g. figures out which of a bunch of overloaded methods you meant), and only if that determines a single unique functional interface, that interface is applied and the lambda/methodref is parsed in that light.\r\n\r\nA functional interface is any interface where you list all methods, remove anything with a default impl, remove anything that `j.l.Object` already has, and if there is precisely 1 method left over - then that is a functional interface, and you can implement it using lambda syntax or methodref syntax.\r\n\r\nHere, if you wrote:\r\n\r\n```\r\ns = Stream.of(s).filter(x -&gt; x != null).sorted(Comparator.comparing(BigDecimal::new)).toArray(String[]::new); \r\n```\r\n\r\nAll is well: `BigDecimal::new` is first treated as &#39;some methodref&#39;, then `Comparator.comparing` is checked, which determines that the argument has to be of type `Comparator&lt;? super X&gt;` where X isn&#39;t clear yet, so the compiler continues and eventually figures out that `s` is a `String[]`, from there it determines that therefore `Stream.of(s)` is a `Stream&lt;String&gt;`, therefore `Stream.of(s).filter(x -&gt; x != null)` is a `Stream&lt;String&gt;`, and from there that the argument to calling `.sorted()` on that must be `Comparator&lt;? super String&gt;`, and picks the most specific bound (`String`), and figures out that the argument needs to be a `Function&lt;String, Z extends Comparable&lt;Z&gt;` where Z can be anything.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s all _very very_ complicated but the compiler manages to get that far, and in that light, parsed `BigDecimal::new` and figures it out: That is an implementation of `Function&lt;String, BigDecimal&gt;`, and BigDecimal is indeed a valid type for Z here. The code compiles and works.\r\n\r\nNow go back to what you have (which tosses a `reversed()` in the mix) and you&#39;ve exceeding the compiler&#39;s abilities to figure this out. It decides to go ahead and &#39;parse&#39; `BigDecimal::new` with less info (because it needs to figure out what `.reversed()` does before it can figure out the context around it), so it tries its best and parses it as a `Function&lt;Object, Z extends Comparable&lt;Z&gt;&gt;` and `BigDecimal::new` doesn&#39;t &#39;fit&#39; that type (as `new BigDecimal(anyObject)` doesn&#39;t exist).\r\n\r\nAnd that&#39;s the error you see.\r\n\r\nSolving it:\r\n\r\nYou need to tell the compiler about that context &#39;sooner&#39;. In your original code, you do that by assigning the comparator to a variable - because now the type of the variable serves as context. You can do that in the second snippet too:\r\n\r\n```\r\nComparator&lt;String&gt; byValue = Comparator.comparing(BigDecimal::new);\r\ns = Stream.of(s).filter(x -&gt; x != null).sorted(byValue.reversed()).toArray(String[]::new);\r\n```\r\n","title":"Java Comparator.Comparing().reversed() won&#39;t accept BigDecimal Constructor issue","body":"<p>Expressions need types.

here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nWe are using the following to gather this information from the cert (which btw, does well when we use it get the cert information for a form if we use normal registration):\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage com.mycompany.pki.pkihelper;\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nimport org.jboss.resteasy.spi.HttpRequest;\r\n...\r\nimport org.jboss.logging.Logger;\r\n\r\npublic class CertHelper {\r\n    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(CertHelper.class);\r\n\r\n    private static String removeBeginEndPem(String pem) {\r\n        pem = pem.replace(&quot;-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----&quot;, &quot;&quot;);\r\n        pem = pem.replace(&quot;-----END CERTIFICATE-----&quot;, &quot;&quot;);\r\n        pem = pem.replace(&quot;\\r\\n&quot;, &quot;&quot;);\r\n        pem = pem.replace(&quot;\\n&quot;, &quot;&quot;);\r\n        return pem.trim();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    public static String getCertificateUserName(HttpRequest httpRequest) {\r\n        \r\n        String firstName = getCertificateFirstName(httpRequest);\r\n        String lastName = getCertificateLastName(httpRequest);\r\n        String userName = firstName+

By default, the JavaFX column resizing policy will keep the columns at their preferred widths.  You aren&#39;t going to get the table columns filling the width of your entire table unless you either set a new column resizing policy or set the sum of the preferred widths of all of your columns to add up to your table width.\r\n\r\nJavaFX does provide a mechanism to [modify the default column resizing policy][2]. By setting the column resize policy to a [CONSTRAINED_RESIZE_POLICY][3], the sum of the widths of every column will be constrained to fill the width of the tableview - even if the tableview is resized or individual columns are resized.  This is likely the behaviour which you desire.\r\n\r\nWhile there may be a way to set a CONSTRAINED_RESIZE_POLICY on a tableView from FXML, I am not aware of one (though my skills in fxml are rudimentary - so perhaps somebody more informed can accomplish the configuration using pure fxml).\r\n\r\nWhat you can do is define a controller for your fxml file and then configure the resize policy in the controller.

How do i save an entity with a composite primary using IdClass key with a CrudRepository?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","java-stream","option-type"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":162699,"reputation":138060,"user_id":3788176,"accept_rate":54,"display_name":"Andy Turner"},"score":0,"creation_date":1620747992,"post_id":67490088,"comment_id":119289997,"body_markdown":"How about using `map` instead of `mapToDouble`?","body":"How about using <code>map</code> instead of <code>mapToDouble</code>?"},{"owner":{"account_id":2139538,"reputation":42521,"user_id":1898563,"accept_rate":78,"display_name":"Michael"},"score":3,"creation_date":1620748135,"post_id":67490088,"comment_id":119290069,"body_markdown":"@AndyTurner Only the primitive stream specializations have `average()`. `Stream&lt;Double&gt;` doesn&#39;t have it.

Create an [`ObjectMapper`][3] to use for JSON mapping (generation/parsing)\r\n```java\r\nvar mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n// optional configuration\r\n```\r\n3. pass your object instance to the suitable [`write..`][4] method\r\n```java\r\ntry {\r\n    // convert object to JSON string and print it \r\n    String json = mapper.writeValueAsString(person)\r\n    System.out.println(json);\r\n}\r\ncatch (JsonGenerationException | JsonMappingException  e) {\r\n    // catch various errors\r\n    e.printStackTrace();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**ℹ️ Note:** You need public getters so Jackson mapper can access and serialize to JSON.\r\n\r\n## Configure desired serialization\r\n\r\n### Exclude null, empty or absent values\r\nTo exclude `null` values in written JSON, you can add the annotation [`@JsonInclude(Include.NON_NULL)`][5] to your properties:\r\n```java\r\npublic class Data {\r\n\r\n  private String name;\r\n  private String age;\r\n  @JsonInclude(Include.NON_NULL)\r\n  private String job;\r\n\r\n  // getters and setters omitted\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThere are a few of similar ex-/inclusion options:\r\n\r\n* `NON_ABSENT`\r\n  &gt; Value that indicates that properties are included unless their value is: null &quot;absent&quot; value of a referential type (like Java 8 `Optional`, or {link java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference}); that is, something that would not deference to a non-null value.\r\n* `NON_EMPTY`\r\n  &gt; Value that indicates that only properties with null value, or what is considered empty, are not to be included.\r\n* `NON_NULL`\r\n  &gt; Value that indicates that only properties with non-null values are to be included.\r\n\r\n### Conditional in-/exclusion\r\n\r\n&gt; I want to create a list of people, but I want the attribute `job` only to appear when the person is more than 30 years old.\r\n\r\nFollowing are 2 ways to achieve this conditional serialization:\r\n* [KISS] a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; solution\r\n* [SOLID] a safe and maintainable design\r\n\r\n#### [KISS] Simple modification of default getter\r\nAssume the class `Data` is only used for the JSON-representation (what we call a DTO).\r\nThen I would solve this simply by implementing a **conditional getter** like:\r\n```java\r\npublic class Data {\r\n\r\n  private String name;\r\n  private String age;\r\n  @JsonInclude(Include.NON_NULL)\r\n  private String job;\r\n\r\n  public String getJob() {\r\n    // exclude in JSON if 30 or younger\r\n    if (Integer.valueOf(age) &lt;= 30) {\r\n       return null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return job;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // remaining getters and setters omitted\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**⚠️ Warning:** This modification breaks the conventional behavior of Java-getters. They should be free of conditions. Thus I added a comment to explain the &quot;why&quot; and kept the if-block easily removable to undo. \r\n\r\n#### [SOLID] Add a custom accessor\r\nClean-code (expressive/additive) that follows design-principles (SRP/OCP) [as recommended by Reilas][6] would:\r\n 1. keep `getJob` as your accessor, and \r\n 2. make a different method to provide the conditional check, call it `job` or `jobIfOver30`. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```java\r\nprivate String job;\r\n\r\n// other fields and getters omitted to focus on custom property serialization\r\n\r\n@JsonIgnore  // 1. ignore the original property to keep accessor\r\npublic String getJob() {\r\n  return job;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@JsonProperty(&quot;job&quot;)  // 2. conditional serialization with original name\r\n@JsonInclude(Include.NON_NULL)\r\npublic String jobIfOver30() {\r\n  if (Integer.valueOf(age) &gt; 30) {\r\n     return job;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**&#128154;️ Benefit:** We don&#39;t need a comment and can invert the if-statement because the added method has\r\n* a single responsibility (JSON serialization only) and \r\n* a self-expressive name.\r\n\r\n#### See also\r\nUnfortunately not the case here, but when the condition depends only on values of the same property, you could use the `@JsonInclude` annotation with [`CUSTOM`][7] option as explained

prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;com.fasterxml.jackson.core&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;jackson-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;2.15.2&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;com.fasterxml.jackson.core&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;jackson-annotations&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;2.15.2&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;com.fasterxml.jackson.core&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;jackson-databind&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;2.15.2&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Create an <a href=\"https://www.javadoc.io/static/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind/2.15.2/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ObjectMapper.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>ObjectMapper</code></a> to use for JSON mapping (generation/parsing)</li>\n</ol>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>var mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n// optional configuration\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>pass your object instance to the suitable <a

e.printStackTrace();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>ℹ️ Note:</strong> You need public getters so Jackson mapper can access and serialize to JSON.</p>\n<h2>Configure desired serialization</h2>\n<h3>Exclude null, empty or absent values</h3>\n<p>To exclude <code>null</code> values in written JSON, you can add the annotation <a href=\"https://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-annotations/javadoc/2.15.2/com/fasterxml/jackson/annotation/JsonInclude.Include.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>@JsonInclude(Include.NON_NULL)</code></a> to your properties:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class Data {\n\n  private String name;\n  private String age;\n  @JsonInclude(Include.NON_NULL)\n  private String job;\n\n  // getters and setters omitted\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are a few of similar ex-/inclusion options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>NON_ABSENT</code>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Value that indicates that properties are included unless their value is: null &quot;absent&quot; value of a referential type (like Java 8 <code>Optional</code>, or {link java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference}); that is, something that would not deference to a non-null value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><code>NON_EMPTY</code>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Value that indicates that only properties with null value, or what is considered empty, are not to be included.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><code>NON_NULL</code>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Value that indicates that only properties with non-null values are to be included.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Conditional in-/exclusion</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I want to create a list of people, but I want the attribute <code>job</code> only to appear when the person is more than 30 years old.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following are 2 ways to achieve this conditional serialization:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[KISS] a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; solution</li>\n<li>[SOLID] a safe and maintainable design</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>[KISS] Simple modification of default getter</h4>\n<p>Assume the class <code>Data</code> is only used for the JSON-representation (what we call a DTO).\nThen I would solve this simply by implementing a <strong>conditional getter</strong> like:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class Data {\n\n  private String name;\n  private String age;\n  @JsonInclude(Include.NON_NULL)\n  private String job;\n\n  public String getJob() {\n    // exclude in JSON if 30 or younger\n    if (Integer.valueOf(age) &lt;= 30) {\n       return null;\n    }\n\n    return job;\n  }\n\n  // remaining getters and setters omitted\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Warning:</strong> This modification breaks the conventional behavior of Java-getters. They should be free of conditions. Thus I added a comment to explain the &quot;why&quot; and kept the if-block easily removable to undo.</p>\n<h4>[SOLID] Add a custom accessor</h4>\n<p>Clean-code (expressive/additive) that follows design-principles (SRP/OCP) <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76764950/how-to-create-a-class-in-java-that-has-an-array-which-can-accept-different-objec/76765608#comment135336569_76765608\">as recommended by Reilas</a> would:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>keep <code>getJob</code> as your accessor, and</li>\n<li>make a different method to provide the conditional check, call it <code>job</code> or <code>jobIfOver30</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>private String job;\n\n// other fields and getters omitted to focus on custom property serialization\n\n@JsonIgnore  // 1. ignore the original property to keep accessor\npublic String getJob() {\n  return job;\n}\n\n@JsonProperty(&quot;job&quot;)  // 2. conditional serialization with original name\n@JsonInclude(Include.NON_NULL)\npublic String jobIfOver30() {\n  if (Integer.valueOf(age) &gt; 30) {\n     return job;\n  }\n\n  return null;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>💚️ Benefit:</strong> We don't need a comment and can invert the if-statement because the added method has</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a single responsibility (JSON serialization only) and</li>\n<li>a self-expressive name.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>See also</h4>\n<p>Unfortunately not the case here, but when the condition depends only on values of the same property, you could use the <code>@JsonInclude</code> annotation with <a href=\"https://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-annotations/javadoc/2.14/com/fasterxml/jackson/annotation/JsonInclude.Include.html#CUSTOM\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>CUSTOM</code></a> option as explained in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60422906/jsonignore-with-conditions\">@JsonIgnore with Conditions</a></li>\n</ul>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":9071166,"reputation":39,"user_id":16359344,"display_name":"Ruan Roussenq Alves"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":110,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":76765608,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1690402292,"creation_date":1690304159,"question_id":76764950,"body_markdown":"I am using Quarkus framework.

I&#39;ll try not to go too technically in-depth but you &amp; future readers need to understand how to deal with these quirks.\r\n\r\n1. There is no ability to move the &#39;read&#39; cursor forward other than actually getting or browsing a message.\r\n\r\n2. There may be far more MQGETs performed than you actually realize.\r\n\r\nThe reason why it takes more than 45 seconds to get to message # 39,500 is because you are pulling all of the data across the network. By that I mean, if the average message size was 100k and you retrieved 39,500 messages, then you dragged a minimum of 3.8GB of data across the network to get to message number 39,500 plus a minimum of 39,500 MQGET API calls.\r\n\r\nNow why do I say &quot;minimum&quot; of 39,500 MQGET API calls? It is because for Java, JMS and .NET applications, the MQ Client library preallocates a 4KB buffer to retrieve the message. So, under the covers, it may take 2 MQGETs to actually retrieve your message if it is larger than 4KB.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve written a lot about it on my blog:\r\n- [JMS and Java Client Mode Performance Issues for MQ Get API Calls][1]\r\n- [How to Improve Your Java/JMS MQ Tuning Cred.][2]\r\n- [Tuning Java Programs for Optimum MQ Get API Calls Performance][3]\r\n\r\nNow to the second part, how to speed up moving the cursor from the current message to say message number 39,500.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 get methods for the MQQueue class: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq/latest?topic=java-mqqueue\r\n\r\nYou should be using the get method that takes 3 parameters for when you are simply wanting to move the cursor forward.\r\n\r\n    public void get(MQMessage message,\r\n                    MQGetMessageOptions getMessageOptions,\r\n                    int maxMsgSize)\r\n             throws MQException\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the loop for moving the cursor forward, you change:\r\n\r\n    queue.get(message, gmo); \r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n    queue.get(message, gmo, 0); \r\n\r\nThere used to be a weird bug if you set the max message length to zero but it appears that it has been fixed.  I still use 1 just to make sure I don&#39;t hit that issue.\r\n\r\nAnd you need to add the MQGMO_ACCEPT_TRUNCATED_MSG option to GMO options.\r\ni.e.\r\n\r\n    gmo.options = CMQC.MQGMO_BROWSE_NEXT + CMQC.MQGMO_FAIL_IF_QUIESCING + CMQC.MQGMO_ACCEPT_TRUNCATED_MSG;\r\n\r\nFinally, you should ALWAYS have &quot;Fail if Quiescing&quot; options added to MQ API calls like MQOPEN, MQGET, MQPUT, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen you set the max. message length to zero &amp; add the MQGMO_ACCEPT_TRUNCATED_MSG option, the MQGET call will throw an MQ exception of 2079 - MQRC_TRUNCATED_MSG_ACCEPTED which is perfectly normal.

I'll try not to go too technically in-depth but you &amp; future readers need to understand how to deal with these quirks.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>There is no ability to move the 'read' cursor forward other than actually getting or browsing a message.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>There may be far more MQGETs performed than you actually realize.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The reason why it takes more than 45 seconds to get to message # 39,500 is because you are pulling all of the data across the network. By that I mean, if the average message size was 100k and you retrieved 39,500 messages, then you dragged a minimum of 3.8GB of data across the network to get to message number 39,500 plus a minimum of 39,500 MQGET API calls.</p>\n<p>Now why do I say &quot;minimum&quot; of 39,500 MQGET API calls? It is because for Java, JMS and .NET applications, the MQ Client library preallocates a 4KB buffer to retrieve the message. So, under the covers, it may take 2 MQGETs to actually retrieve your message if it is larger than 4KB.</p>\n<p>I've written a lot about it on my blog:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.capitalware.com/rl_blog/?p=5647\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JMS and Java Client Mode Performance Issues for MQ Get API Calls</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.capitalware.com/rl_blog/?p=5619\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">How to Improve Your Java/JMS MQ Tuning Cred.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.capitalware.com/rl_blog/?p=5598\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tuning Java Programs for Optimum MQ Get API Calls Performance</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now to the second part, how to speed up moving the cursor from the current message to say message number 39,500.</p>\n<p>There are 3 get methods for the MQQueue class: <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq/latest?topic=java-mqqueue\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq/latest?topic=java-mqqueue</a></p>\n<p>You should be using the get method that takes 3 parameters for when you are simply wanting to move the cursor forward.</p>\n<pre><code>public void get(MQMessage message,\n                MQGetMessageOptions getMessageOptions,\n                int maxMsgSize)\n         throws MQException\n</code></pre>\n<p>Therefore, in the loop for moving the cursor forward, you change:</p>\n<pre><code>queue.get(message, gmo); \n</code></pre>\n<p>to</p>\n<pre><code>queue.get(message, gmo, 0); \n</code></pre>\n<p>There used to be a weird bug if you set the max message length to zero but it appears that it has been fixed.  I still use 1 just to make sure I don't hit that issue.</p>\n<p>And you need to add the MQGMO_ACCEPT_TRUNCATED_MSG option to GMO options.\ni.e.</p>\n<pre><code>gmo.options = CMQC.MQGMO_BROWSE_NEXT + CMQC.MQGMO_FAIL_IF_QUIESCING + CMQC.MQGMO_ACCEPT_TRUNCATED_MSG;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, you should ALWAYS have &quot;Fail if Quiescing&quot; options added to MQ API calls like MQOPEN, MQGET, MQPUT, etc.</p>\n<p>When you set the max. message length to zero &amp; add the MQGMO_ACCEPT_TRUNCATED_MSG option, the MQGET call will throw an MQ exception of 2079 - MQRC_TRUNCATED_MSG_ACCEPTED which is perfectly normal. MQ will return the MQMD of the message along with an empty message buffer. You just handle the MQ exception and loop again for the next message.</p>\n<p>Hence, the time it takes to move the cursor to message number 39,500 should now be under 5 seconds, maybe even less than 1 second depending on your network traffic.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":7050143,"reputation":50,"user_id":5399526,"display_name":"JP13"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":76774726,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1690402192,"creation_date":1690377149,"question_id":76771706,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m currently writing an Application for viewing messages in an IBM MQ.\r\nNow I am implementing pagination.

To find a fix for the C# code, at least a rough understanding of PKCS#1 v1.5 padding is required (for an exact specification see [RFC8017][1]): \r\n \r\nFor PKCS#1 v1.5 padding, the message M is first hashed: H, then the digest ID is prepended:  \r\nT = ID || H (more precisely, T is the DER encoding of the DigestInfo).  \r\nWhen padding, T is prefixed with 0x00 || 0x01 || PS || 0x00, where PS consists of so many 0xFF values that the signature size is equal to the RSA key size (i.e. the modulus).  \r\n\r\nSo the whole signature is: 0x00 || 0x01 || PS || 0x00 || T.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nIn the Java code, `hashBase64` corresponds to the Base64 encoding of T, where the ID corresponds to that of SHA256. To see this, the easiest way is to Base64 decode `hashBase64` and then hex encode the resulting data:  \r\n```none\r\n3031300d060960864801650304020105000420 6944f8baf4cbbea730e77134bbb59398389777dea16538318666f32a34379bc4\r\n```\r\nThis value, i.e. T, becomes most understandable when viewed in an Asn.1 parser, e.g. https://lapo.it/asn1js/.  \r\n\r\n`NONEwithRSA` defines that the data is *directly* interpreted as T (so neither the message is hashed nor an ID is prepended). \r\n \r\nIn this way, the signature 0x00 || 0x01 || PS || 0x00 || T is also generated, i.e. you get the same PKCS#1 v1.5 compliant signature as if you use the original data (from which the hash was generated) and the algorithm `SHA256withRSA`.\r\n\r\nSigning already hashed data is the actual purpose of `NONEwithRSA` (namely when the signing authority is only allowed to know the hash, but not the actual data).
