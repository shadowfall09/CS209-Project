I don't know exactly what the onComplete() log means, since it's being shown before the execution of the getRequestExchange method (which is invoked).

Also, I hear about decoupling when multiple subscribers are being invoked, so I tried to  avoid them as possible.</p>\n<p>Any help regarding reactive programming, reactor-core, or the specific flow and how to improve it it's appreciated.</p>\n<p>Cheers.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":14283811,"reputation":6405,"user_id":10317684,"display_name":"Ricky Mo"},"score":0,"creation_date":1635385897,"post_id":69747337,"comment_id":123286157,"body_markdown":"You can write `this.methodName()` to call another method within the same class.

You are not working with SQL, so you should not be using `java.sql.Timestamp`.  The `java.time` classes also have many improvements over obsolete date and time functions used in other Java packages like `java.util`.\r\n\r\n### Answer in context with a re-write of your example code\r\n\r\nThere were a lot of things about the provided example application that were either wrong or annoyed me. \r\n\r\nSo I re-wrote it to match a bit more closely how I would normally write such an application.  \r\n\r\nThere are maybe a hundred different small decisions made in the choices for how to implement the re-write and explaining them all here would be too verbose.\r\n\r\nHopefully, you can compare the re-write to your original code, note some of the differences, and learn some things from it.\r\n\r\n[![example app][2]][2]\r\n\r\n**GraphicControlApp.java**\r\n\r\n    package

using a standard format.</p>\n<p>It sets the formatted timestamp string as the text of a Label node.</p>\n<p>Now that the returned element is a Node, it can be placed in the scene graph without generating the compile error you saw in your original example.</p>\n<p>Using the <code>java.time</code> APIs is preferred over the <code>java.sql.Timestamp</code> and <code>java.util.Date</code> code in your question. You are not working with SQL, so you should not be using <code>java.sql.Timestamp</code>.  The <code>java.time</code> classes also have many improvements over obsolete date and time functions used in other Java packages like <code>java.util</code>.</p>\n<h3>Answer in context with a re-write of your example code</h3>\n<p>There were a lot of things about the provided example application that were either wrong or annoyed me.</p>\n<p>So I re-wrote it to match a bit more closely how I would normally write such an application.</p>\n<p>There are maybe a hundred different small decisions made in the choices for how to implement the re-write and explaining them all here would be too verbose.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, you can compare the re-write to your original code, note some of the differences, and learn some things from it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VnRrF.png\"

This API is located in a module called &quot;Menu.API&quot;, and has the following classes defined:\r\n\r\n`@MenuProvider`:\r\n```java\r\npackage com.my.menu.api;\r\n\r\n@Documented\r\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n@Target(ElementType.CLASS)\r\n@Repeatable(RepeatableMenus.class)\r\npublic @interface MenuProvider {\r\n    String name();\r\n    String text();\r\n    int position();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`@RepeatableMenus`:\r\n```java\r\npackage com.my.menu.api;\r\n\r\n@Documented\r\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\n@Target(ElementType.TYPE)\r\npublic @interface RepeatableMenus {\r\n    MenuProvider[] value();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFor the sake of brevity, we will only concentrate on this annotation, because I am sure the rest of them will work with whatever solution I am able to get for this one.\r\n\r\nWith this module completed, I created the `module-info.java` file with the following contents:\r\n```java\r\nmodule Menu.API {\r\n    requires java.base;   // Just for the sake of completeness.\r\n\r\n    exports com.my.menu.api;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, with the API in place, I created a second module called &quot;Menu.Platform&quot;, with the following class defined:\r\n```java\r\npackage com.my.platform;\r\n\r\n// Imports removed for brevity.\r\n\r\n@MenuProvider(name = &quot;fileMenu&quot;, text = &quot;File&quot;, position = Integer.MIN_VALUE)\r\n@MenuProvider(name = &quot;editMenu&quot;, text = &quot;Edit&quot;, position = Integer.MIN_VALUE + 1)\r\n@MenuProvider(name = &quot;toolsMenu&quot;, text = &quot;Tools&quot;, position = Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1000)\r\n@MenuProvider(name = &quot;helpMenu&quot;, text = &quot;Help&quot;, position = Integer.MAX_VALUE)\r\npublic class App {\r\n\r\n    private final MainFrame mainFrame;\r\n    private final JMenuBar menuBar;\r\n    private final JToolBar toolBar;\r\n    private final JPanel statusPanel;\r\n    private final JLabel statusLabel;\r\n    \r\n    public static MenuProvider provider() {\r\n        // I am not sure how to send back my @MenuProvider annotations.\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public App() {\r\n        configureWindowParts();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void configureWindowParts() {\r\n        // No problems here...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void initialize(String[] args) {\r\n        // I do not need the args[] variable yet.\r\n        \r\n        createMenuBar();\r\n    \r\n        // ... the rest of the initialization.\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void createMenuBar() {\r\n        ServiceLoader&lt;MenuProvider&gt; menusLoader = ServiceLoader.load(MenuProvider.class);\r\n\r\n        // PostionableMenu is a subclass of JMenu that implements Comparable and provides\r\n        //+ the `position` parameter.\r\n        List&lt;PositionableMenu&gt; menus = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n        for (MenuProvider p : menusLoader) {\r\n            PositionableMenu menu = new PositionableMenu(p.name(), p.text(), p.position());\r\n            menus.add(menu);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        Collections.sort(menus);\r\n\r\n        menus.foreach(m -&gt; {\r\n            menuBar.add(m);\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`module-info.java`:\r\n```java\r\nmodule Menu.Platform {\r\n    requires java.desktop;\r\n    requires Menu.API;\r\n\r\n    uses com.my.menu.api.MenuProvider;\r\n    uses com.my.menu.api.RepeatableMenus;\r\n\r\n    export com.my.platform;\r\n\r\n    provides com.my.menu.api.MenuProvider with com.my.platform.App;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo my problem is that I receive the error: \r\n```\r\nthe service implementation type must be a subtype of the service interface type,\r\nor have a public static no-args method named &quot;provider&quot; returning the service implementation\r\n```\r\n...when I do not have the `public static MenuProvider provider()` method in my `App` class. But then when I put that method in my `App` class, I have no clue how to return those four (4) `@MenuProvider`s from the method.\r\n\r\nAny assistance that can be given to point me in the right direction is greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advance!\r\n\r\n-SC\r\n\r\n[EDIT]\r\nWell, I spent so long thinking of just how to ask this question that the answer came to me shortly after posting it...\r\n\r\nWhat needs to be returned from the `provider` method is obtained by reflecting on the class:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    public static MenuProvider provider(){\r\n        MenuProvider[] provider = App.class.getAnnotationsByType(MenuProvider.class);\r\n        \r\n        // How to return an array? If I change the return type to an\r\n        //+ array, I get errors again because the provider method only\r\n        //+ wants to return a single instance.\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was my conundrum now. So I was thinking about how to edit this question when the answer hit me like a ton of bricks! Instead of returning the `MenuProvider`, I needed to return the `RepeatableMenus` instance.  The `value` property of `RepeatableMenus` returns an array of `MenuProvider`s. DUH!\r\n\r\nSo, I updated the `provider` method as follows:\r\n```java\r\n    public static RepeatableMenus provider(){\r\n        RepeatableMenus provider = App.class.getAnnotation(RepeatableMenus.class);\r\n        \r\n        return provider;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAnd, I changed my `module-info.java` file to this:\r\n```java\r\nmodule Menu.Platform {\r\n    requires java.desktop;\r\n    requires Menu.API;\r\n\r\n    uses com.my.menu.api.MenuProvider;\r\n    uses com.my.menu.api.RepeatableMenus;\r\n\r\n    export com.my.platform;\r\n\r\n    provides com.my.menu.api.RepeatableMenus with com.my.platform.App;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow, I am receiving all of the `@MenuProvider` instances from my class. I cannot wait to try it from an additional module...\r\n\r\nThank you all anyway for the possible help you would have offered.\r\n\r\n-SC","title":"Using ServiceLoader to get All Instances of an Annotation","body":"<p>All!</p>\n<p>I know that long questions are frowned upon, but this is the only way I will be able to get my problem adequately explained.

This is because what `order.receiveHiredObject` returns is determined by the runtime type of `order`, and the _compiler_ has no way of knowing what that is.

So parameterize your `send` method.\r\n\r\n### Design issues\r\nBefore:  No parameter but static hard-coded request. Thus not testable.\r\n```java\r\npublic VehicleRequest sendRequest() throws Exception {\r\n    out.println(VehicleRequest.toJSON(new VehicleRequest(2008,&quot;Honda&quot;,&quot;Civic&quot;)));\r\n    return VehicleRequest.fromJSON(in.readLine());\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote: the method signature `...Request sendRequest()` can be read like &quot;output = produceInput()&quot;. This style of designing methods or functions is called [pure function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function): it usually converts an input to a new output - it produces something, like a response.\r\n\r\nDesign issues:\r\nHere no input can be given. The returned product or answer could be expected to be always the same. Wouldn&#39;t you like to ask different questions or send different requests. So that the expected answer depends on the given request.\r\n\r\n### Improve\r\nAfter: Added parameter to make testable with different `request`s. Method name simplified.\r\n```java\r\npublic VehicleResponse send(VehicleRequest request) throws Exception {\r\n    out.println(VehicleRequest.toJSON(request));\r\n    return VehicleResponse.fromJSON(in.readLine());\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nThis can be called in your `main` or in a test like `response = client.send(new VehicleRequest(2008,&quot;Honda&quot;,&quot;Civic&quot;))`.\r\n\r\n## Object representation: JSON-conversion as separate-concern\r\nThere are some basic representation formats like `String` that are tightly coupled to each class. In Java this _concern_ is inherited from `Object` class&#39;s methods `toString()` and for some wrapper-classes like `Integer.valueOf(String s)`.\r\n\r\nHowever more complex representations, especially REST- or HTTP-related like _JSON_, `XML`, `HTML`, but also binary formats are usually treated by a design principle called [Separation of Concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). Especially in web-applications (like your simplified client-server architecture) this leads to separate layers (best-practice):\r\n\r\n * Representation layer (concern of UI, Web, Communication) .. e.g. your `Client` / `Server` classes and Jackson&#39;s `ObjectMapper` handling JSON-conversion\r\n * Business layer (concern of Logic) .. e.g. your `Vehicle..` classes \r\n * Persistence layer (concern of Storage, Database, etc.)\r\n\r\nSee these separate concerns illustrated as layers, e.g. in Wikipedia [Multi-tier Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture) or in Robert C. Martin&#39;s [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).\r\n\r\n## Design issues\r\nThe external dependency Jackson is duplicated part of your DTO-classes like `..Request` and `..Response`. So both depend on Jackson and JSON-format.\r\n\r\nBefore: Concern of representation layer is mixed into DTO-classes, which might change along with Business layer. Now they need to change with each format, the client can support, too (strong-coupling and 2 reasons to change).\r\n```\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnore;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\n\r\n// ..\r\n\r\n@JsonIgnore\r\nprivate static final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n\r\n// duplicated code, implemented similarly for both classes\r\npublic static String toJSON(VehicleRe.. vehicle) throws Exception {\r\n    return objectMapper.writeValueAsString(vehicle);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static VehicleRe.. fromJSON(String input) throws Exception{\r\n    return objectMapper.readValue(input, VehicleRe.. .class);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote: You could move this cross-cutting (used by many classes) concern into the client. This way, your (entity) classes stay independent from the format/mapping-framework and the client can be easily extended to support other formats (like XML) in the future. \r\n\r\n## Improve\r\nAfter: In REST formats are concern of the representation layer. The client is responsible of content-negotiation and conversion. \r\n```java\r\nclass Client {\r\n   private final ObjectMapper mapper;\r\n\r\n   // Mapper can be injected as dependency, configurable from ouside\r\n   public Client(ObjectMapper mapper) {\r\n       this.mapper = mapper;\r\n       // optional remaining initialization, could add ip, port, etc.\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   public VehicleResponse send(VehicleRequest vehicle) throws Exception {\r\n       String request = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(vehicle);  // to &lt;textual-format&gt;\r\n\r\n       out.println(request); // request as String (now JSON, future XML)\r\n       String response = in.readLine(); // request as String (now JSON, future XML)\r\n       \r\n       return objectMapper.readValue(response); // from &lt;textual-format&gt;\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis way you can in your main-method simply create a special XML-capable client by configuring like\r\n`Client xmlClient = new Client(new XmlMapper())` or use as-is (with JSON as content-exchange format): `Client client = new Client(new ObjectMapper())`.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\nFor your CS-course and homework this might be too much and over-engineering. \r\n\r\nHowever in &quot;real code&quot;, as seen in professional web-frameworks like `Spring`, this is good or best-practice and contributes to extensible and maintainable software, see [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) .","title":"How to convert an input into a method that the program will understand","body":"<p>Although <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/69712620/5730279\">João Dias already solved your lapse by fixing the response-type</a>, I would like to share some practical advice on JSON-conversion especially when implementing web-API <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">facades</a> like your <code>Client</code> / <code>Server</code> classes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>pure-functions</strong> with parameters make code more testable: <code>send(request)</code></li>\n<li>content-conversion (from/into formats, like JSON) is a (cross-cutting) <strong>separate concern</strong>: inject a reusable component like <code>ObjectMapper</code> into client and server (representation layer) to make your request/response classes format-independent</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The resulting code might appeal to you as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>more readable</li>\n<li>easier to comprehend and debug</li>\n<li>less coupled</li>\n<li>easier to maintain and extend</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Request to response: <code>send</code> as <em>pure function</em></h2>\n<p>Usually the responsibility of a client is to send multiple different requests.

Method name simplified.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public VehicleResponse send(VehicleRequest request) throws Exception {\n    out.println(VehicleRequest.toJSON(request));\n    return VehicleResponse.fromJSON(in.readLine());\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This can be called in your <code>main</code> or in a test like <code>response = client.send(new VehicleRequest(2008,&quot;Honda&quot;,&quot;Civic&quot;))</code>.</p>\n<h2>Object representation: JSON-conversion as separate-concern</h2>\n<p>There are some basic representation formats like <code>String</code> that are tightly coupled to each class. In Java this <em>concern</em> is inherited from <code>Object</code> class's methods <code>toString()</code> and for some wrapper-classes like <code>Integer.valueOf(String s)</code>.</p>\n<p>However more complex representations, especially REST- or HTTP-related like <em>JSON</em>, <code>XML</code>, <code>HTML</code>, but also binary formats are usually treated by a design principle called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Separation of Concerns</a>. Especially in web-applications (like your simplified client-server architecture) this leads to separate layers (best-practice):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Representation layer (concern of UI, Web, Communication) .. e.g. your <code>Client</code> / <code>Server</code> classes and Jackson's <code>ObjectMapper</code> handling JSON-conversion</li>\n<li>Business layer (concern of Logic) .. e.g. your <code>Vehicle..</code> classes</li>\n<li>Persistence layer (concern of Storage, Database, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See these separate concerns illustrated as layers, e.g. in Wikipedia <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Multi-tier Architecture</a> or in Robert C. Martin's <a href=\"https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Clean Architecture</a>.</p>\n<h2>Design issues</h2>\n<p>The external dependency Jackson is duplicated part of your DTO-classes like <code>..Request</code> and <code>..Response</code>. So both depend on Jackson and JSON-format.</p>\n<p>Before: Concern of representation layer is mixed into DTO-classes, which might change along with Business layer. Now they need to change with each format, the client can support, too (strong-coupling and 2 reasons to change).</p>\n<pre><code>import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnore;\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\n\n// ..\n\n@JsonIgnore\nprivate static final ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\n\n// duplicated code, implemented similarly for both classes\npublic static String toJSON(VehicleRe.. vehicle) throws Exception {\n    return objectMapper.writeValueAsString(vehicle);\n}\n\npublic static VehicleRe.. fromJSON(String input) throws Exception{\n    return objectMapper.readValue(input, VehicleRe.. .class);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: You could move this cross-cutting (used by many classes) concern into the client. This way, your (entity) classes stay independent from the format/mapping-framework and the client can be easily extended to support other formats (like XML) in the future.</p>\n<h2>Improve</h2>\n<p>After: In REST formats are concern of the representation layer. The client is responsible of content-negotiation and conversion.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>class Client {\n   private final ObjectMapper mapper;\n\n   // Mapper can be injected as dependency, configurable from ouside\n   public Client(ObjectMapper mapper) {\n       this.mapper = mapper;\n       // optional remaining initialization, could add ip, port, etc.\n   }\n\n   public VehicleResponse send(VehicleRequest vehicle) throws Exception {\n       String request = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(vehicle);  // to &lt;textual-format&gt;\n\n       out.println(request); // request as String (now JSON, future XML)\n       String response = in.readLine(); // request as String (now JSON, future XML)\n       \n       return objectMapper.readValue(response); // from &lt;textual-format&gt;\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This way you can in your main-method simply create a special XML-capable client by configuring like\n<code>Client xmlClient = new Client(new XmlMapper())</code> or use as-is (with JSON as content-exchange format): <code>Client client = new Client(new ObjectMapper())</code>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>For your CS-course and homework this might be too much and over-engineering.</p>\n<p>However in &quot;real code&quot;, as seen in professional web-frameworks like <code>Spring</code>, this is good or best-practice and contributes to extensible and maintainable software, see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SOLID</a> .</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":22611674,"reputation":65,"user_id":16791732,"display_name":"Tobi "},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":182,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":69712620,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1635364836,"creation_date":1635036343,"question_id":69693090,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m currently working on my homework about client and server topic:\r\nI created a class called `VehileRequest.java` which will take three variables (year, make, model) from `Client.java` and pass them to `Server.java` then the `Server` will get information from `VehicleRespone.java` and display the information about price, miles vv...\r\n\r\nAs I understand, the program didn&#39;t recognize the request that pass to the respond file.\r\n\r\nI got stuck at passing the Request to Response so that the Response will understand.

And I'd suggest you to use a better name for the <code>BroadcastReceiver</code>. Something like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class Receiver extends BroadcastReceiver {\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the <code>Manifest.xml</code> would look like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;receiver android:name=&quot;Receiver&quot;\n    android:exported=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;intent-filter&gt;\n            &lt;action android:name=&quot;com.tutorialspoint.CUSTOM_INTENT&gt; \n           &lt;/action&gt;\n        &lt;/intent-filter&gt;\n&lt;/receiver&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Still you'll have to find the <strong>real</strong> main activity that you're using and make sure it has the same as in <code>Manifest.xml</code> and in this case that is <code>MainActivity</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;activity\n    android:name=&quot;.MainActivity&quot;\n    android:exported=&quot;true&quot;\n    tools:ignore=&quot;Instantiatable&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;intent-filter&gt;\n            &lt;action android:name=&quot;android.intent.action.MAIN&quot;

So, to avoid making you do something like <code>new Math().sqrt(5);</code>, they make a static method, which you can call like <code>Math.sqrt(5);</code>.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":16445344,"reputation":21,"user_id":11880305,"display_name":"HARSHIT DANG"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":94,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1615995038,"answer_count":1,"score":-4,"last_activity_date":1635360919,"creation_date":1615938071,"question_id":66665025,"body_markdown":"I read this about when we should use static functions, but I didn&#39;t understand it.
