The default _content pane_ is a `JPanel` whose layout manager is [BorderLayout][6]. Hence no need to add your components to a `JPanel` and add that `JPanel` to the `JFrame`. You can add components directly to the `JFrame`. Just be aware that when you are adding components directly to a `JFrame`, you are actually adding them to a `JPanel` with `BorderLayout`.\r\n\r\nAnd since the _content pane_ is a `JPanel`, you are free to also change its layout manager &amp;ndash; as you have done in your code via this line:\r\n```java\r\nframe.setLayout(grid);\r\n```\r\nNote that you only need to set one of the dimensions in the `GridLayout` constructor. Here is a quote from the _javadoc_ of that constructor.\r\n&gt; One, but not both, of rows and cols can be zero, which means that any number of objects can be placed in a row or in a column.\r\n\r\nIn other words, for your tic-tac-toe game, you need only set the columns to 3. That means that each row will contain no more than three columns so when you add nine buttons, `GridLayout` will ensure that they will be arranged in three rows of three columns each.

The default <em>content pane</em> is a <code>JPanel</code> whose layout manager is <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/border.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BorderLayout</a>. Hence no need to add your components to a <code>JPanel</code> and add that <code>JPanel</code> to the <code>JFrame</code>. You can add components directly to the <code>JFrame</code>. Just be aware that when you are adding components directly to a <code>JFrame</code>, you are actually adding them to a <code>JPanel</code> with <code>BorderLayout</code>.</p>\n<p>And since the <em>content pane</em> is a <code>JPanel</code>, you are free to also change its layout manager – as you have done in your code via this line:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>frame.setLayout(grid);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that you only need to set one of the dimensions in the <code>GridLayout</code> constructor. Here is a quote from the <em>javadoc</em> of that constructor.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One, but not both, of rows and cols can be zero, which means that any number of objects can be placed in a row or in a column.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, for your tic-tac-toe game, you need only set the columns to 3. That means that each row will contain no more than three columns so when you add nine buttons, <code>GridLayout</code> will ensure that they will be arranged in three rows of three columns each. Hence, for your tic-tac-toe board, you can use the following code.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>GridLayout grid = new GridLayout(0, 3); // zero rows and three columns\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":23096189,"reputation":57,"user_id":17206264,"display_name":"ntg_908"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1958,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":69673258,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1634914047,"creation_date":1634878859,"question_id":69671622,"body_markdown":"Im trying to build a tic tac toe game with swing.

Keeping this in mind will ease the overall understanding of the inheritance.</p>\n<p>Another viable example:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class A {\n  private int num1;\n  private int num2;\n\n   public A () { // this will be called with super() method call from B's constructor\n\n  }\n\n  public A (int num1, int num2){\n    this.num1 = num1;\n    this.num2 = num2;\n  }\n}\n\nclass B extends A {\n  private int num3;\n  private int num4;\n\n  public B (int num3, int num4){\n\n     // super(); // called by default, but you can write it\n\n    this.num3 = num3;\n    this.num4 = num4;\n  \n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":20675616,"reputation":1,"user_id":15180298,"display_name":"braiden-cu"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":88,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1634913196,"creation_date":1634908390,"question_id":69677521,"body_markdown":"So, not so much a question for a specific project but more for understanding for future.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t understand what the daughter class constructors are meant to look like and contain.

it doesnt recognize the text properly you can check below I have added one more edittext to show you the difference on how the text send by texts.getText() gives you better result.</p>\n<p>Check the code below:</p>\n<pre><code>import android.app.Activity;\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport android.graphics.Bitmap;\nimport android.graphics.BitmapFactory;\nimport android.graphics.Matrix;\nimport android.media.ExifInterface;\nimport android.net.Uri;\nimport android.os.Build;\nimport android.os.Bundle;\nimport android.os.Environment;\nimport android.os.ParcelFileDescriptor;\nimport android.os.StrictMode;\nimport android.provider.MediaStore;\nimport android.util.Log;\nimport android.view.View;\nimport android.widget.AdapterView;\nimport android.widget.ArrayAdapter;\nimport android.widget.EditText;\nimport android.widget.ImageButton;\nimport android.widget.Spinner;\nimport android.widget.Toast;\n\nimport androidx.annotation.NonNull;\nimport androidx.annotation.RequiresApi;\nimport androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;\nimport androidx.core.content.FileProvider;\n\nimport com.google.android.gms.tasks.OnFailureListener;\nimport com.google.android.gms.tasks.OnSuccessListener;\nimport com.google.android.gms.tasks.Task;\n\nimport com.google.mlkit.vision.common.InputImage;\nimport com.google.mlkit.vision.text.Text;\nimport com.google.mlkit.vision.text.TextRecognition;\nimport com.google.mlkit.vision.text.TextRecognizer;\nimport com.google.mlkit.vision.text.latin.TextRecognizerOptions;\n\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.FileDescriptor;\nimport java.io.FileNotFoundException;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.text.SimpleDateFormat;\nimport java.util.Date;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Locale;\n\npublic class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {\n    private static final String TAG = &quot;MainActivity&quot;;\n    private ImageButton imageButton_Site;\n    private EditText editText_Site;\n    EditText editText;\n    private Spinner spinner_Site;\n    private InputImage createdImage;\n    String recognizedText=&quot;&quot;;\n    String currentPhotoPath;\n    static final int REQUEST_IMAGE_CAPTURE = 1;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n        editText_Site=findViewById(R.id.editText_Site);\n        editText=findViewById(R.id.editText);\n        imageButton_Site = findViewById(R.id.imageButton_Site);\n        spinner_Site = findViewById(R.id.spinner_Site);\n        String[] items = new String[]{&quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;Ludwigshafen&quot;};

Unfortunately, current compilers have a tendency to flood the error messages with reports about generic signature mismatches, making it easy to overlook the simpler errors like methods or types that haven’t been found, which are more than often the actual cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is no `stream()` method in `Map`. You have to decide which collection view to stream on, `keySet()`, `entrySet()` or `values()`. Obviously, you want to use `map-&gt; map.entrySet().stream()` instead of `map-&gt; map.stream()`.\r\n\r\nSecond, you used `Collectors.reducing` instead of the obviously intended `Collectors.mapping`.\r\n\r\nFixing these errors should be sufficient to let the generic signature errors go away as well; the result of the `groupingBy` collector is a `Map&lt;Integer, LinkedHashSet&lt;String&gt;&gt;` then, but unfortunately, it’s not an order maintaining map by default. Therefore, you have to add a map `Supplier`, i.e. `LinkedHashMap::new` to enforce the use of an order maintaining `Map`.\r\n\r\nThen, you have to copy the result map’s `values()` to a `LinkedHashSet` to get a result of the desired type, i.e. `new LinkedHashSet&lt;&gt;(resultMap.values())`.\r\n\r\nPutting it all together, we get:\r\n\r\n    Map&lt;Integer,String&gt; map1 = map(1,&quot;a1&quot;, 2,&quot;b1&quot;, 3,&quot;c1&quot;);\r\n    Map&lt;Integer,String&gt; map2 = map(1,&quot;a2&quot;, 2,&quot;b2&quot;, 3,&quot;c2&quot;);\r\n    Map&lt;Integer,String&gt; map3 = map(1,&quot;a3&quot;, 2,&quot;b3&quot;, 3,&quot;c3&quot;);\r\n\r\n    Map&lt;Integer, LinkedHashSet&lt;String&gt;&gt; m = Stream.of(map1, map2, map3)\r\n        .flatMap( map -&gt; map.entrySet().stream() )\r\n        .collect( Collectors.groupingBy(Map.Entry::getKey,\r\n            LinkedHashMap::new,\r\n            Collectors.mapping(Map.Entry::getValue,\r\n                Collectors.toCollection(LinkedHashSet::new))));\r\n    LinkedHashSet&lt;LinkedHashSet&lt;String&gt;&gt; result=new LinkedHashSet&lt;&gt;(m.values());\r\n    // [[a1, a2, a3], [b1, b2, b3], [c1, c2, c3]]\r\n    System.out.println(result);\r\n&#160;\r\n\r\n    static &lt;K,V&gt; Map&lt;K,V&gt; map(K k1, V v1, K k2, V v2, K k3, V v3) {\r\n        LinkedHashMap&lt;K,V&gt; m=new LinkedHashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n        m.put(k1, v1);\r\n        m.put(k2, v2);\r\n        m.put(k3, v3);\r\n        return m;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI hope, you still recognize your original approach within the changed code.\r\nYou can also integrate the post-processing step into the `Collector` via `collectingAndThen`:\r\n\r\n    LinkedHashSet&lt;LinkedHashSet&lt;String&gt;&gt; result = Stream.of(map1, map2, map3)\r\n        .flatMap( map -&gt; map.entrySet().stream() )\r\n        .collect( Collectors.collectingAndThen(\r\n            Collectors.groupingBy(Map.Entry::getKey,\r\n                LinkedHashMap::new,\r\n                Collectors.mapping(Map.Entry::getValue,\r\n                    Collectors.toCollection(LinkedHashSet::new))),\r\n            m -&gt; new LinkedHashSet&lt;&gt;(m.values())));\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that this result will only look rectangular, like a transposed table of the original maps, if the values are all unique. `LinkedHashSet`, like any other `Set`, will eliminate duplicate elements. This does not only apply to the sub-sets, but also to the result set that will eliminate identical sub-sets.\r\n","title":"Reducing/Collecting stream of a flattened map in particular traversing order (not Depth-first search)","body":"<p>Your original approach isn’t so bad, but you have small errors within it.

Therefore, you have to add a map <code>Supplier</code>, i.e. <code>LinkedHashMap::new</code> to enforce the use of an order maintaining <code>Map</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Then, you have to copy the result map’s <code>values()</code> to a <code>LinkedHashSet</code> to get a result of the desired type, i.e. <code>new LinkedHashSet&lt;&gt;(resultMap.values())</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Putting it all together, we get:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Map&lt;Integer,String&gt; map1 = map(1,\"a1\", 2,\"b1\", 3,\"c1\");\nMap&lt;Integer,String&gt; map2 = map(1,\"a2\", 2,\"b2\", 3,\"c2\");\nMap&lt;Integer,String&gt; map3 = map(1,\"a3\", 2,\"b3\", 3,\"c3\");\n\nMap&lt;Integer, LinkedHashSet&lt;String&gt;&gt; m = Stream.of(map1, map2, map3)\n    .flatMap( map -&gt; map.entrySet().stream() )\n    .collect( Collectors.groupingBy(Map.Entry::getKey,\n        LinkedHashMap::new,\n        Collectors.mapping(Map.Entry::getValue,\n            Collectors.toCollection(LinkedHashSet::new))));\nLinkedHashSet&lt;LinkedHashSet&lt;String&gt;&gt; result=new LinkedHashSet&lt;&gt;(m.values());\n// [[a1, a2, a3], [b1, b2, b3], [c1, c2, c3]]\nSystem.out.println(result);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<pre><code>static &lt;K,V&gt; Map&lt;K,V&gt; map(K k1, V v1, K k2, V v2, K k3, V v3) {\n    LinkedHashMap&lt;K,V&gt; m=new LinkedHashMap&lt;&gt;();\n    m.put(k1, v1);\n    m.put(k2, v2);\n    m.put(k3, v3);\n    return m;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I hope, you still recognize your original approach within the changed code.\nYou can also integrate the post-processing step into the <code>Collector</code> via <code>collectingAndThen</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>LinkedHashSet&lt;LinkedHashSet&lt;String&gt;&gt; result = Stream.of(map1, map2, map3)\n    .flatMap( map -&gt; map.entrySet().stream() )\n    .collect( Collectors.collectingAndThen(\n        Collectors.groupingBy(Map.Entry::getKey,\n            LinkedHashMap::new,\n            Collectors.mapping(Map.Entry::getValue,\n                Collectors.toCollection(LinkedHashSet::new))),\n        m -&gt; new LinkedHashSet&lt;&gt;(m.values())));\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It should be mentioned that this result will only look rectangular, like a transposed table of the original maps, if the values are all unique. <code>LinkedHashSet</code>, like any other <code>Set</code>, will eliminate duplicate elements. This does not only apply to the sub-sets, but also to the result set that will eliminate identical sub-sets.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1429890,"reputation":6439,"user_id":1352530,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"Whimusical"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":195,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":42505884,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1634905554,"creation_date":1488205387,"question_id":42488106,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m checking everything for reducing/collecting a flattened map in my particular traverse order (not Depth-first search) and can&#39;t find an example/collectors signature for this kind of operation.

I've commented out a couple different places I've tried placing the car.draw sections.</p>\n<p>I've edited the code to just resemble how the boolean flags aren't corresponding with the lights changing.</p>\n<p>Also if I can get the flags to work how can I call upon that flag in another class?</p>\n<pre><code>  int greenX, greenY = 50;   // Alphas of Green Lights (50 = OFF &amp; 250 = ON)\n  int redX, redY = 50;       // Alphas of Red Lights (50 = OFF &amp; 250 = ON)\n  int yellowX, yellowY = 50; // Alphas of Yellow Lights (50 = OFF &amp; 250 = ON) \n  int time;                  // set to equal millis()\n  int lastInterval;          // Used to update time since last light change then used to take away from &quot;time&quot; in order to get amount of time specified\n  float interval = 5;        // Interval for Lights in Seconds\n  float wait = 1000*interval; // turn interval from seconds to millis\n  char lightX = 'G';         // Switch for Lights on X-Cords\n  char lightY = 'R';         // Switch for Lights on Y-Cords\n  boolean X, Y, Xy, Yy;  // Booleans for Lights to corespond to draw/make car (Xy &amp; Yy = yellow lights)\n\nvoid setup() {\n}\n\n  void draw() {\n    time = millis();\n    println(&quot;Last Interval Times is &quot; + lastInterval/1000);\n\n    if (time - lastInterval &lt; wait) { //  // If the Light has been green for less than wait time\n      if ((X == true) &amp;&amp; (Y == false)) {\n    }\n      println(&quot;X-Light = &quot; + X);\n      println(&quot;Y-Light = &quot; + Y);\n    } \n\n    if (time - lastInterval &gt;= wait) {  // If the Light has been green for more than wait time\n        X = !X;\n        Y = !Y;\n      if (lightX == 'G' &amp;&amp; lightY == 'R') {\n        lightX = 'Y';\n        lightY = 'R';\n      } \n      else if (lightX == 'Y' &amp;&amp; lightY == 'R') {\n        lightX = 'R';\n        lightY = 'G';\n      } \n      else if (lightX == 'R' &amp;&amp; lightY == 'G') {\n        lightX = 'R';\n        lightY = 'Y';\n      }\n      else if (lightX == 'R' &amp;&amp; lightY == 'Y') {\n        lightX = 'G';\n        lightY = 'R';\n      }\n      lastInterval = time; // Update last Interval to time of light change\n    }\n\n\n    switch(lightX) {        //Switch For X-Cord Lights\n    case 'G':              // Green Light\n      println(&quot;X-Axis = Green Light&quot;);\n      time = millis();\n      greenX = 250;\n      yellowX = 50;\n      redX = 50;\n      X = true;\n      Xy = true;\n      break;\n\n    case 'Y':              // Yellow Light\n      println(&quot;X-Axis = Yellow Light&quot;);\n      time = millis();\n      greenX = 50;\n      yellowX = 250;\n      redX = 50;\n      Xy = true;\n      X = !X;\n      break;\n\n\n    case 'R':             //Red Light\n      println(&quot;X-Axis = Red Light&quot;);\n      time = millis();\n      greenX = 50;\n      yellowX = 50;\n      redX = 250;\n      Xy = !X;\n      X = !X;\n      break;\n    }\n\n    switch(lightY) {       //Switch For Y-Cord Lights\n    case 'G':              // Green Light\n      println(&quot;Y-Axis = Green Light&quot;);\n      println(time/1000);\n      println();\n      time = millis();\n      greenY = 250;\n      yellowY = 50;\n      redY = 50;\n      Y = true;\n      Yy = true;\n      break;\n\n    case 'Y':              // Yellow Light\n      println(&quot;Y-Axis = Yellow Light&quot;);\n      println(time/1000);\n      println();\n      time = millis();\n      greenY = 50;\n      yellowY = 250;\n      redY = 50;\n      Yy = true;\n      Y = !Y;\n      break;\n\n\n    case 'R':             //Red Light\n      println(&quot;Y-Axis = Red Light&quot;);\n      println(time/1000);\n      println();\n      time = millis();\n      greenY = 50;\n      yellowY = 50;\n      redY = 250;\n      Y = !Y;\n      Yy = !Yy;\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":7595189,"reputation":44576,"user_id":5761558,"display_name":"ernest_k"},"score":9,"creation_date":1634899204,"post_id":69675431,"comment_id":123156667,"body_markdown":"`try (Writer w = out) {`: that&#39;s a try-with-resources.
