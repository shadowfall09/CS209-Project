Re using requestFocusInWindow, I am using that (in the RequestFocusListener above), rather than requestFocus.  And the RequestFocusListener does not get triggered until the window becomes active and visible unless I am mistaken (as described in the RequestFocusListener example, re the AncestorListener interface). I have wrapped the focus code in an invokeLater call, to delay it, but that has not solved the issue."},{"owner":{"account_id":969721,"reputation":344527,"user_id":992484,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"MadProgrammer"},"score":0,"creation_date":1355197346,"post_id":13810945,"comment_id":19005111,"body_markdown":"@dingfelder Sounds like something else is interfering with the change of focus...","body":"@dingfelder Sounds like something else is interfering with the change of focus..."}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":969721,"reputation":344527,"user_id":992484,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"MadProgrammer"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":7,"is_accepted":true,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1495593299,"creation_date":1355181276,"answer_id":13810945,"question_id":13810777,"body_markdown":"There are any number of possible reasons a request for focus will fail.\r\n\r\nTo start with, the Java Docs for `Component#requestFocus` actually states\r\n\r\n&gt; Because the focus behavior of this method is platform-dependent,\r\n&gt; developers are strongly encouraged to use requestFocusInWindow when\r\n&gt; possible.\r\n\r\nAnd\r\n\r\n&gt; This component must be displayable, focusable, visible and all of its\r\n&gt; ancestors (with the exception of the top-level Window) must be visible\r\n&gt; for the request to be granted\r\n\r\nIn order for a component to become focusable, the component and all it&#39;s ancestors must be valid (displayable).

By converting source string to lower-case and call `String.contains()` with the pre-cached, lower-cased substring. This solution is already not as flexible because it tests a predefiend substring.\r\n 4. Using regular expression (the accepted answer `Pattern.compile().matcher().find()`...)\r\n 5. Using regular expression but with pre-created and cached `Pattern`. This solution is already not as flexible because it tests a predefined substring.\r\n\r\n\r\nResults (by calling the method 10 million times):\r\n\r\n 1. Our method: 670 ms\r\n 2. 2x toLowerCase() and contains(): 2829 ms\r\n 2. 1x toLowerCase() and contains() with cached substring: 2446 ms\r\n 3. Regexp: 7180 ms\r\n 4. Regexp with cached `Pattern`: 1845 ms\r\n\r\nResults in a table:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n                                            RELATIVE SPEED   1/RELATIVE SPEED\r\n METHOD                          EXEC TIME    TO SLOWEST      TO FASTEST (#1)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n 1.

The communication protocol is mqtt. The goal of the entire code is to send a valve opening command to the device, and then listen for the device&#39;s response message to change the status of the operation record to completed. In order to achieve asynchronous and non blocking effects, we introduced the Reactor. core framework. But first of all, as far as I know, the Mono object requires the entire flow to start working after calling the subscribe method.However, the use of Sinks. one to construct Mono objects in the above code did not explicitly call the subscribe method, but the entire code can run normally. I am very confused about this and hope someone can resolve my doubts. Thank you.\r\n\r\nand by the way i have saw a few words about this,like this &quot;Mono.from is a factory method that adapts any kind of Publisher to a Mono. It will only take the first element and ignore subsequent signals (completion, errors) if any.

The communication protocol is mqtt. The goal of the entire code is to send a valve opening command to the device, and then listen for the device's response message to change the status of the operation record to completed. In order to achieve asynchronous and non blocking effects, we introduced the Reactor. core framework. But first of all, as far as I know, the Mono object requires the entire flow to start working after calling the subscribe method.However, the use of Sinks. one to construct Mono objects in the above code did not explicitly call the subscribe method, but the entire code can run normally. I am very confused about this and hope someone can resolve my doubts.

I decided to try and run the decrypt from the cli to see if that worked, so I ran this with the same error:</p>\n<p><code>aws kms decrypt --ciphertext-blob fileb://&lt;(echo 'encrypted-data' | base64 -d) --key-id arn:aws:kms:&lt;region&gt;:&lt;accountid&gt;:key/&lt;id&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the error doesn't provide any useful information. I already checked to make sure that the lambda function has the <code>kms:Decrypt</code> and <code>kms:DescribeKey</code> policies.</p>\n<p>I had tried with a NodeJS function to see if that would work at one point and it actually would work with this code:</p>\n<pre><code>const b64 = require('base64-js');\nconst encryptionSdk = require('@aws-crypto/client-node');\nconst { decrypt } = encryptionSdk.buildClient(\n  encryptionSdk.CommitmentPolicy.REQUIRE_ENCRYPT_ALLOW_DECRYPT\n);\nconst generatorKeyId = process.env.KEY_ALIAS;\nconst keyIds = [process.env.KEY_ARN];\nconst keyring = new encryptionSdk.KmsKeyringNode({ generatorKeyId, keyIds });\n\nif (event.request.code) {\n  const { plaintext } = await decrypt( keyring, b64.toByteArray(event.request.code) );\n  return plaintext.toString();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Anyone else have this issue?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","internationalization","currency","turkish"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":7745,"reputation":189765,"user_id":13531,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"Michael Myers"},"score":2,"creation_date":1242928804,"post_id":894223,"comment_id":701432,"body_markdown":"This doesn&#39;t immediately help, but file a bug and it&#39;ll probably be fixed in the next Java update.","body":"This doesn&#39;t immediately help, but file a bug and it&#39;ll probably be fixed in the next Java update."},{"owner":{"account_id":17205,"reputation":7140,"user_id":38264,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"z  -"},"score":1,"creation_date":1242930483,"post_id":894223,"comment_id":701565,"body_markdown":"there is no way other than to create your own wrapper for Currency.
