So, it allows us to break our dataset down into small &quot;buckets&quot; where all records in a certain bucket are guaranteed to be different from all records in all other buckets. Then, we can process each bucket individually, effectively having broken the problem down into many smaller problems, each one of which will hopefully<sup>1</sup> fit within memory.</p>\n<p>A very rough algorithm follows. This algorithm can be greatly improved upon, (optimized,) I am just showing it here to illustrate the general idea.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>For each record:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compute its hash-code.</li>\n<li>Create a &quot;bucket&quot; file if it does not already exist, using the hash-code as filename.</li>\n<li>Append the record to the bucket file.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>Then, for each bucket file:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read the entire bucket file into memory.</li>\n<li>Scan for duplicates.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since each bucket is independent, we can process many of them in parallel if we want to.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> I say &quot;hopefully&quot; because whether this will work or not depends on the content of your dataset. If your 2 billion records consist of only 2 different records, then you will have only 2 buckets of 1 billion records each, and this will not work either. But if you have sufficient variety in your data, meaning that you are not suffering from any pathological duplication scenarios, then it will work.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":23736008,"reputation":25,"user_id":17754688,"display_name":"umang"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":378,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1668949150,"creation_date":1668435100,"question_id":74432998,"body_markdown":"I have a database table and has 2 billion records in it and wanted to find duplicate records by reading each line and keep only unique records Then update one of the parent table with new adr_id  wherever old adr_id was being used \r\ne.g. \r\n\r\n**Before Address**\r\n\r\n|adr_id|ver_id|address|\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n|11|0|newYork|\r\n|12|0|Washington|\r\n|13|1|Washington|\r\n|14|1|newYork|\r\n|15|2|Washington|\r\n\r\nResult file should have unique records as below \r\n\r\n**After Address**\r\n\r\n|adr_id|ver_id|address|\r\n|--|--|--|\r\n|100|0|newYork|\r\n|101|0|Washington|\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any standard framework in java which can help me to process \r\n2 billion records in parallel with minimum time ?\r\nE.g.

I that case, you will notice a difference even in Spring AOP, because `@within` would still match the proxied interface, while `@target` would not. Why is that?\r\n\r\n  * `@within` asks if the actual type is annotated. A class implementing or extending an interface type `@Marker MyInterface`, is a `MyInterface` too due to class inheritance. Therefore, asking if that interface type has a `@Marker` annotation will yield a positive result.\r\n\r\n  * `@target` asks if the runtime type, i.e. the Spring AOP proxy, has the `@Marker` annotation, which it does not. Annotations, even if they carry the `@Inherited` meta annotation, can only be inherited from class to class, not from interface to class or super method to overriding method, cf. [javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/annotation/Inherited.html). Therefore, the proxy class implementing the interface does not carry the same annotations as the implemented interface.

The java.time classes use [ISO 8601][3] formats by default when parsing/generating date-time values.\r\n\r\nSpecify a [proper time zone name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_zones_by_name) in the format of `continent/region`, such as [`America/Montreal`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America/Montreal), [`Africa/Casablanca`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa/Casablanca), or `Pacific/Auckland`. Never use the 3-4 letter abbreviation such as `EST` or `IST` as they are *not* true time zones, not standardized, and not even unique(!). For example, your use of `IST` may be Irish Standard Time, Israel Standard Time (as interpreted by java.time, seen above), or India Standard Time. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n# About java.time\r\n\r\nThe [java.time](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html) framework is built into Java 8 and later. These classes supplant the troublesome old [legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system) date-time classes such as [`java.util.Date`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Date.html), [`Calendar`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html), &amp; [`SimpleDateFormat`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html).\r\n\r\nThe [Joda-Time](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) project, now in [maintenance mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_mode), advises migration to the [java.time](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html) classes.\r\n\r\nTo learn more, see the [Oracle Tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/TOC.html). And search Stack Overflow for many examples and explanations. Specification is [JSR 310](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310).\r\n\r\nWhere to obtain the java.time classes? \r\n\r\n - [**Java SE 8**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_8) and [**SE 9**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_9) and later\r\n  - Built-in. \r\n  - Part of the standard Java API with a bundled implementation.\r\n  - Java 9 adds some minor features and fixes.\r\n - [**Java SE 6**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_6) and [**SE 7**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_7)\r\n  - Much of the java.time functionality is back-ported to Java 6 &amp; 7 in [***ThreeTen-Backport***](http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/).\r\n - [**Android**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system))\r\n  - The [***ThreeTenABP***](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP) project adapts *ThreeTen-Backport* (mentioned above) for Android specifically.\r\n  - See [*How to use ThreeTenABP…*](https://stackoverflow.com/q/38922754/642706).\r\n\r\nThe [ThreeTen-Extra](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/) project extends java.time with additional classes. This project is a proving ground for possible future additions to java.time. You may find some useful classes here such as [`Interval`](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/Interval.html), [`YearWeek`](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/YearWeek.html), [`YearQuarter`](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/YearQuarter.html), and [more](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/index.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html\r\n  [2]: http://ideone.com/nBDdXP\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601","title":"How to convert &quot;Mon Jun 18 00:00:00 IST 2012&quot; to 18/06/2012?","body":"<h1>java.time</h1>\n\n<p>The modern approach is with the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">java.time</a> classes.

Never use the 3-4 letter abbreviation such as <code>EST</code> or <code>IST</code> as they are <em>not</em> true time zones, not standardized, and not even unique(!).
