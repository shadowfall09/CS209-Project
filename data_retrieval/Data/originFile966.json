Calling it (the second segment in main()) with page size set to 500, it also returns no response control (array is null) but it happily allows me to list all 5000 users without issues. If I use the commented SearchControl() with parameters instead of default, then I get the size limit exceeded exception after 500. \r\n\r\nIt seems both ApacheDS and ActiveDirectory do not honor PagedResultsControl... I recall I used to be able to page many years ago. \r\n\r\nThe closest question I can find is this:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/51878159/why-doesnt-active-directory-return-me-a-pagedresultsresponsecontrol\r\nAnd it does not have an answer. The comment about disabling referral is not applicable as I have already tried not using it (the commented line about SearchControls). \r\n\r\nIs the code sample now out of date and needs changes?

Examples below.\r\n\r\nAnd a general solution to your problem: use plugin architecture - the best thing (and maybe the only thing) that OOP can offer.

I have overriden the equals method and the hashCode","title":"add words from file java","body":"<p>I have a txt file which contains only this one line &quot;website which allows me to do&quot;. I want to build a tree based on the file such that: root is the &quot;+&quot; sign, first letter of a word in the file is the child of the root PROVIDED that letter already doesn't exist in the tree. Here is my code:</p>\n<pre><code>public class TreeTest {\n    \n    public void parse(File f) throws Exception {\n        Node root = new  Node('+'); //create a root node\n        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(f)));\n        \n        String line;\n        while((line = br.readLine())!=null){\n            String[] words = line.toLowerCase().split(&quot; &quot;);\n            \n            for(int i = 0; i &lt; words.length; i++){\n                addToTree(words[i], root);\n            }\n        }//end of while\n                \n        System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(root.children()));\n        \n        br.close();\n    }\n    \n    public void addToTree(String s, Node root){\n    \n            char[] characters = s.toCharArray();\n            \n            if(characters.length &gt; 0){\n                Node addChar1 = new Node(characters[0]);\n                \n            \n                //if the root has no children ??\n                //add the first addChar1 as a child\n                if (root.hasChildren()==false){\n                    root.addChild(addChar1);\n                    \n                }\n                //root has children\n            \n                //get the child nodes of the root\n                Node[] rootChildren = root.children();\n                \n                for(int i=0; i&lt;rootChildren.length; i++){\n                    Node rootChild = rootChildren[i];\n                    //see if the addChar1 already exists in the tree\n                    //if it doesn't\n                    \n                    if(!rootChild.equals(addChar1)){\n                        //add the addChar1 as a child of the root\n                        root.addChild(addChar1);\n                                                     \n                    }\n                    else{\n                        System.out.println(addChar1.getItem() + &quot; Exists in the tree already&quot;);\n                    }           \n                \n                }\n                \n            }//end of addToTree\n            \n    }\n    \n     public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n         TreeTest test = new TreeTest();\n         \n         File f = new File(&quot;textFile.txt&quot;);\n         test.parse(f);\n     }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I don't understand why the output is:</p>\n<pre><code> character   w    Exists in the tree already\n character   w    Exists in the tree already\n[w, a, m, m, t, t, t, t, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d]\n</code></pre>\n<p>why does it only outputs that 'w' exists in the tree even though there are order letters as well such as 'o' ?
