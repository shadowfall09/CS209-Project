You don't want that - you want to pass the idea of 'how do I make a dog'. <code>Dog::new</code> turns into a <code>Supplier&lt;Dog&gt;</code> that operates by executing new Dog() every time you call <code>.get()</code> on that supplier.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":15555087,"reputation":1,"user_id":11221779,"display_name":"Narwhals64"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1676940532,"creation_date":1676938392,"question_id":75515298,"body_markdown":"I would like to pass an ArrayList of a class (i.e. Dog) that implements an interface (i.e. Animal) through a method, and I would like the method to create an instance of the given class.\r\n\r\nI have tried many methods so far, but every resource I&#39;ve found has told me how to do one part of the whole, yet combining those parts has been fruitless.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n   private interface Animal {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private class Dog implements Animal {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void Main(String[] args) {\r\n        ArrayList&lt;Dog&gt; dogs = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n        doSomething(dogs);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static &lt;T extends Animal&gt; void doSomething(ArrayList&lt;T&gt; list) {\r\n        // This line does not compile or produces NoSuchMethodException based on how it&#39;s written:\r\n        T newObj = new T().getClass().getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();\r\n        list.add(newObj);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, would it be possible to pass an ArrayList of Dogs and expect `doSomething` method to add a Dog?","title":"Create Instance of a Class extending an Interface, passed through a Method?","body":"<p>I would like to pass an ArrayList of a class (i.e. Dog) that implements an interface (i.e. Animal) through a method, and I would like the method to create an instance of the given class.</p>\n<p>I have tried many methods so far, but every resource I've found has told me how to do one part of the whole, yet combining those parts has been fruitless.</p>\n<pre><code>   private interface Animal {\n\n    }\n\n    private class Dog implements Animal {\n\n    }\n\n    public static void Main(String[] args) {\n        ArrayList&lt;Dog&gt; dogs = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n\n        doSomething(dogs);\n    }\n\n    public static &lt;T extends Animal&gt; void doSomething(ArrayList&lt;T&gt; list) {\n        // This line does not compile or produces NoSuchMethodException based on how it's written:\n        T newObj = new T().getClass().getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();\n        list.add(newObj);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example, would it be possible to pass an ArrayList of Dogs and expect <code>doSomething</code> method to add a Dog?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","regex","validation","url"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2214260,"reputation":3942,"user_id":1955317,"accept_rate":71,"display_name":"Squazz"},"score":0,"creation_date":1677231650,"post_id":75513630,"comment_id":133301031,"body_markdown":"This post, has a bunch of regular expressions you might be able to use. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6038061/regular-expression-to-find-urls-within-a-string/41242257\n\nFull disclosure: One of the answers is mine.","body":"This post, has a bunch of regular expressions you might be able to use. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6038061/regular-expression-to-find-urls-within-a-string/41242257\" title=\"regular expression to find urls within a string\">stackoverflow.com/questions/6038061/&hellip;</a>  Full disclosure: One of the answers is mine."},{"owner":{"account_id":2214260,"reputation":3942,"user_id":1955317,"accept_rate":71,"display_name":"Squazz"},"score":0,"creation_date":1677231668,"post_id":75513630,"comment_id":133301033,"body_markdown":"Does this answer your question?

Then we have the BIOS chip - which is also a standardized interface, but it&#39;s never made public in any way, only a few companies know the exact details in private. So, of course, interfaces can have any visibility!

Okay, that&#39;s possible, but you don&#39;t have to - and java is not going to let you abuse the type system simply because &#39;well, maaaaybe it will work&#39;.\r\n\r\nThus, to sort a `Person` array, the only comparator that will do is a `Comparator&lt;Person&gt;`, or a `Comparator&lt;Object&gt;`.\r\n\r\nA `Comparator&lt;Person&gt;` can already compare 2 developers - because all developers are persons.

If you already have a comparator that can compare any 2 persons, then there is no further need for a comparator for developers, or for employees. Given that all employees and all developers are also persons, it doesn&#39;t matter.\r\n\r\nYou appear to be looking for, perhaps, &#39;reverse types&#39;, where your Person comparator is capable only of comparing specifically instances of Person itself (i.e. stuff made as `new Person()`), and is not capable of comparing objects created as `new Developer()`. __Java does not work that way__ - you said `class Employee extends Person`, therefore, __all Employees are also Persons__, and there is no way to say &#39;I have a comparator that can compare all X, but not any subtypes of X&#39;.\r\n\r\nHence, your mental model doesn&#39;t work here and your question is not directly answerable because of it.\r\n\r\nYou have two options:\r\n\r\n## Heterogenous arrays\r\n\r\nYou have a single array that contains a combo of persons, developers, and employees all mixed and matched. The only way to sort it, is to have a comparator that can compare 2 persons (which could be `new Person()`, or `new Developer()`, or `new Employee()` - those are _all_ persons!).\r\n\r\n## Homogenous arrays\r\n\r\nYou have a single array and it is in fact bound to contain only Xs, where X is either Person _or_ Employee _or_ Developer. There is no way to say &#39;I have an array with SOLELY objects created with `new Person()` and not objects created as `new Developer()`, so if it&#39;s `Person[]`, we&#39;re in the same boat as the heterogenous array situation. However, it&#39;s possible you want a way to say: Given an array of Xs, and a Comparator of that same X, sort em.\r\n\r\nYou can do that. But, you are confused about generics syntax.\r\n\r\n## Type var declaration vs usage\r\n\r\nYou wrote:\r\n\r\n&gt; ```java\r\n&gt; public static void sortPeople(Person[] array, Comparator&lt;T extends Person&gt; comparator) {\r\n&gt;        Arrays.sort(array, comparator);\r\n&gt;    }\r\n&gt; ```\r\n\r\nT is being _used_, but you declared it nowhere, hence, this code makes no sense. Given that it&#39;s a static method, there are no type vars available except those you declare. So, you have to declare them. You put bounds in as you declare, usually. You CAN do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static &lt;T extends Person&gt; void sortPeople(T[] array, Comparator&lt;T&gt; comparator) {\r\n  Arrays.sort(array, comparator);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we first _declare_ a new type var named `T` (you put these after the modifiers and before the return type, it&#39;s the `&lt;T extends Person&gt;` part there), and, once declared, we use it - twice, once for the array type, once for the comparator. This code works fine, and you can invoke it with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDeveloper[] devs = ...;\r\nComparator&lt;Developer&gt; c = ...;\r\nSortingUtil.sortPeople(devs, c);\r\n\r\n// or\r\nPerson[] persons = ...;\r\nComparator&lt;Person&gt; p = ...;\r\nSortingUtil.sortPeople(persons, p);\r\n\r\n// BUT NOT:\r\n\r\nPerson[] persons = new Person[2];\r\npersons[0] = new Developer();\r\npersons[1] = new Developer();\r\nComparator&lt;Developer&gt; c = ...;\r\nSortingUtil.sortPeople(persons, c);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat last one does not work - your eyeballs can tell that this person array contains only developers, but the type system doesn&#39;t say that. The type system says that persons array could contain an employee too, or a `new Person()`, and your comparator can&#39;t compare those, so that code does not compile.\r\n\r\n## An important note\r\n\r\nArrays and generics do not mix. Do not do this. Do not use arrays of non-primitive types. Use a `List&lt;Person&gt;` instead of a `Person[]`.\r\n\r\n## The common confusion about generics\r\n\r\nYou may be thinking: I have a list of persons. Actually, it&#39;s not JUST `new Person()`, it could be `new Developer()` too, so I want a `List&lt;? extends Person&gt;`, not a `List&lt;Person&gt;` right?\r\n\r\nNo. You&#39;re missing that generics is one abstraction layer higher. A list that contains all of `new Person()`, `new Developer()`, and `new Employee()` __is__ a `List&lt;Person&gt;`, not a `List&lt;? extends Person&gt;` - all developers are persons, after all! There is _no way_ to express &#39;a list that contains only `new Person()` and not `new Developer()`.\r\n\r\nNo, a `List&lt;? extends Person&gt;` expresses the idea that the list ITSELF is bound to contain Persons (which also means developers or employees, all mixed together, if you want), _OR_ only developers, _OR_ only employees. You&#39;re capturing the notion that you want this variable or parameter to allow containing any of `new ArrayList&lt;Person&gt;()`, `new ArrayList&lt;Developer&gt;()`, as well as `new ArrayList&lt;Employee&gt;()`, and restricts you to write only code that would work for all 3 of those.\r\n\r\nFor example, a `List&lt;? extends Person&gt;` __has no add method at all!!__ - or rather, it does, but there is NOTHING you could pass that wouldn&#39;t be a compiler error, except literally `list.add(null)` because `null` fits all types. After all, it COULD be a `List&lt;Employee&gt;`, and it COULD be a `List&lt;Developer&gt;`, and there isn&#39;t any object that can be both an employee and a developer at the same time, therefore, there is simply no way to add anything.\r\n\r\nThis is great if you are writing a method that isn&#39;t going to add stuff anyway.\r\n\r\nRead up on [PECS](https://www.baeldung.com/java-generics-pecs), that&#39;ll help.\r\n","title":"How do I sort an array of multiple classes using comparators","body":"<p>Given a <code>Person[]</code> array, java knows that every item in that array could be a Person.

The type system says that persons array could contain an employee too, or a <code>new Person()</code>, and your comparator can't compare those, so that code does not compile.</p>\n<h2>An important note</h2>\n<p>Arrays and generics do not mix. Do not do this. Do not use arrays of non-primitive types. Use a <code>List&lt;Person&gt;</code> instead of a <code>Person[]</code>.</p>\n<h2>The common confusion about generics</h2>\n<p>You may be thinking: I have a list of persons. Actually, it's not JUST <code>new Person()</code>, it could be <code>new Developer()</code> too, so I want a <code>List&lt;? extends Person&gt;</code>, not a <code>List&lt;Person&gt;</code> right?</p>\n<p>No. You're missing that generics is one abstraction layer higher. A list that contains all of <code>new Person()</code>, <code>new Developer()</code>, and <code>new Employee()</code> <strong>is</strong> a <code>List&lt;Person&gt;</code>, not a <code>List&lt;? extends Person&gt;</code> - all developers are persons, after all! There is <em>no way</em> to express 'a list that contains only <code>new Person()</code> and not <code>new Developer()</code>.</p>\n<p>No, a <code>List&lt;? extends Person&gt;</code> expresses the idea that the list ITSELF is bound to contain Persons (which also means developers or employees, all mixed together, if you want), <em>OR</em> only developers, <em>OR</em> only employees. You're capturing the notion that you want this variable or parameter to allow containing any of <code>new ArrayList&lt;Person&gt;()</code>, <code>new ArrayList&lt;Developer&gt;()</code>, as well as <code>new ArrayList&lt;Employee&gt;()</code>, and restricts you to write only code that would work for all 3 of those.</p>\n<p>For example, a <code>List&lt;? extends Person&gt;</code> <strong>has no add method at all!!</strong> - or rather, it does, but there is NOTHING you could pass that wouldn't be a compiler error, except literally <code>list.add(null)</code> because <code>null</code> fits all types. After all, it COULD be a <code>List&lt;Employee&gt;</code>, and it COULD be a <code>List&lt;Developer&gt;</code>, and there isn't any object that can be both an employee and a developer at the same time, therefore, there is simply no way to add anything.</p>\n<p>This is great if you are writing a method that isn't going to add stuff anyway.</p>\n<p>Read up on <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/java-generics-pecs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PECS</a>, that'll help.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":27503600,"reputation":84,"user_id":20986750,"display_name":"Marco Riccetti"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1676929091,"creation_date":1676929091,"answer_id":75514373,"question_id":75514089,"body_markdown":" In truth, you cannot compare different classes, even if they belong to a hierarchy of classes, if each class does not have as many attributes as you want to use for sorting.\r\n\r\nA possible workaround would be to decide what happens if you compare an attribute with the fact that the attribute does not exist.\r\n\r\nOnce you have decided this, assume that any value of the attribute is greater than the absence of that attribute,\r\nwe could write an interface for the comparison to be implemented by classes done in the following way:\r\n\r\n    interface PersonComparable extends Comparable&lt;Person&gt;

Our back-end is developed in Java and works stateless as REST services. The demo client should be based on Angular as we want to try out some things first. Both I and other developers already have expertise there. Whereby other web future oriented frameworks are also welcome. \r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nThe migration to a new client is no problem and no challenge. However, there are one or two problems and challenges. We have a couple of functions that require a lot of processing power but these functions are executed on the client side. In the future this should no longer be the case but happen in the backend. So far so good BUT these algorithms start with various start parameters and execute certain logic. In the course via. Dialogs various new input parameters are needed or information messages are displayed.  So the program or these function(s) wait for the user input before continuing. (These do not run in their own thread btw). The whole thing should now be outsourced to the backend. \r\nHere the question arises how something like this could be implemented.

Our back-end is developed in Java and works stateless as REST services. The demo client should be based on Angular as we want to try out some things first. Both I and other developers already have expertise there. Whereby other web future oriented frameworks are also welcome.</p>\n<p>Problem:\nThe migration to a new client is no problem and no challenge. However, there are one or two problems and challenges. We have a couple of functions that require a lot of processing power but these functions are executed on the client side. In the future this should no longer be the case but happen in the backend. So far so good BUT these algorithms start with various start parameters and execute certain logic. In the course via. Dialogs various new input parameters are needed or information messages are displayed.  So the program or these function(s) wait for the user input before continuing. (These do not run in their own thread btw). The whole thing should now be outsourced to the backend.\nHere the question arises how something like this could be implemented.
