But it never does. The Client side get&#39;s stuck where last log line is:\r\n\r\n    02.10.23-04:23:55@com.ffleuchten.conduit.peripheral.utils.ConduitConnector: (18801883-15c9-457f-960d-17a57c4e97ee)objectoutputstream created: java.io.ObjectOutputStream@7de62196\r\n\r\nwhich tells me, that it is right before creating the objectinputstream, which it never does.\r\n\r\nFunny thing is: 45 transactions are handled correct(counting the transaction complete lines in the log). But the 46th transaction get&#39;s stuck. btw: all the transactions do the same on server side.\r\n\r\nSo what&#39;s happening here? Does anyone has any suggestions on why this is happening? It feels like the treadpoolexecutor never executes the Transaction run method. But if so, why does the client get stuck on creating the objectinputstream then? shouldn&#39;t it stop when client is trying to receive data from the (not executing) server side?\r\nI am out of ideas about this one. Any help is highly appreciated ;)\r\n\r\nas mentioned in the comments I added some status info about the threadpoolexecutor to the logs.

It feels like the treadpoolexecutor never executes the Transaction run method.

By trying to do this calculations by hand it turns out the same values as the software (taking the filesize  with explorer.exe and the bitrate with HxD)</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","google-app-engine","oauth-2.0","google-shared-contacts"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":9917587,"reputation":640,"user_id":7341878,"accept_rate":10,"display_name":"Prakash"},"score":0,"creation_date":1501654845,"post_id":45441031,"comment_id":77866613,"body_markdown":"ok but I am getting an exception as `java.net.UnknownHostException: www.google.com` when ever I am trying to insert contact. is there any solution for this @Khalil M","body":"ok but I am getting an exception as <code>java.net.UnknownHostException: www.google.com</code> when ever I am trying to insert contact. is there any solution for this @Khalil M"},{"owner":{"account_id":5744747,"reputation":1838,"user_id":4742188,"accept_rate":79,"display_name":"Khalil M"},"score":0,"creation_date":1501667266,"post_id":45441031,"comment_id":77874873,"body_markdown":"@Prakash I can&#39;t be sure without relevant code snippet but my guess is you are using proxy so check if network allows you to connect via code","body":"@Prakash I can&#39;t be sure without relevant code snippet but my guess is you are using proxy so check if network allows you to connect via code"},{"owner":{"account_id":9917587,"reputation":640,"user_id":7341878,"accept_rate":10,"display_name":"Prakash"},"score":0,"creation_date":1501671709,"post_id":45441031,"comment_id":77878045,"body_markdown":"ok but when I run that application under localhost its working fine but when I deploy it I am facing this error.

However, could the use of global variables in the when clause, combined with concurrent rule execution, be causing this unexpected behavior?</p>\n<p>Here's a snippet of my code:</p>\n<pre><code>public void executeRules(DomainEventRulesProvider rulesProvider, Object fact, Map&lt;String, Object&gt; globals) throws RuleEvaluationException {\n    // Create a new KieSession each time\n    final KieContainer kieContainer = droolsKieContainerProvider.getKieContainer(rulesProvider);\n    final KieSession session = kieContainer.newKieSession();\n\n   CloseableKieSession closeableSession = new CloseableKieSession(session);\n        final KieSession kieSession = closeableSession.getSession();\n        if(globals != null) {\n            globals.forEach((key, val) -&gt; {\n                if (val == null) {\n                    throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Null value passed for global variable: &quot; + key);\n                }\n                kieSession.setGlobal(key, val);\n            });\n        }\n        setupFactAndFireAllRules(fact, kieSession);\n}\n\n// Set up the fact and fire all rules\nprivate void setupFactAndFireAllRules(Object fact, KieSession kieSession) {\n    kieSession.insert(fact);\n    kieSession.fireAllRules();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm using Drools with a singleton KieContainer, but I create a new KieSession for each execution of the function. In this function, I check if my globals map is null; it's essentially a map with a string key and a list value. The list is supposed to be modified by Drools rules.</p>\n<p>I suspect that concurrent rule execution may be the cause of the unexpected behavior. Any insights or suggestions on how to handle this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Is there any way I can test the concurrent execution of these rules and find a root cause in case such errors occur</p>\n<pre><code> public KieContainer getKieContainer(@NonNull final RulesProvider rulesProvider) {\n        if (containerCache.containsKey(rulesProvider.getKieBaseName())) {\n            return containerCache.get(rulesProvider.getKieBaseName());\n        }\n\n        final KieServices ks = KieServices.Factory.get();\n        final KieRepository kr = ks.getRepository();\n        final KieFileSystem kfs = ks.newKieFileSystem();\n        final KieModuleModel km = ks.newKieModuleModel();\n        final List&lt;Resource&gt; rules = rulesProvider.getRules();\n        rules.forEach(kfs::write);\n        km.newKieBaseModel(rulesProvider.getKieBaseName())\n                .newKieSessionModel(rulesProvider.getKieSessionName())\n                .setDefault(true);\n        kfs.writeKModuleXML(km.toXML());\n\n        final KieBuilder kb = ks.newKieBuilder(kfs);\n        kb.buildAll();\n        if (kb.getResults().hasMessages(Message.Level.ERROR)) {\n            throw new KieContainerBuildException(&quot;Build Errors:\\n&quot; + kb.getResults().toString());\n        }\n\n        final KieContainer container = ks.newKieContainer(kr.getDefaultReleaseId());\n        containerCache.put(rulesProvider.getKieBaseName(), container);\n        log.info(&quot;KieContainer created for : {}&quot;, rulesProvider.getKieBaseName());\n        return container;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","azure","azureservicebus","spring-jms"],"owner":{"account_id":17191106,"reputation":21,"user_id":12444856,"display_name":"Pavan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":72,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1696431421,"creation_date":1696431421,"question_id":77230704,"body_markdown":"I am running into an issue where, listener session closing abruptly and connection not restored and no error code.

The app runs but gets the exception below when some data is being serialized in one of the REST controllers.  No code or library changes were made.  the only difference is that im trying to now run the app from the eclipse open liberty plugin instead of the myeclipse WAS plugin.</p>\n<p>im not clear where to even look for this issue.  It looks like spring is maybe not using the same jackson version?  Note, the same code works fine in WAS. And why would I get an error like this when serializing?</p>\n<p>A couple thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm assuming the servlet jar is different.  I see  javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet.service in the stack trace, which is why I mention this.  I was a little confused about where the servlet jar was coming from with Open Liberty.  the OL eclipse plugin did not seem to include this.</li>\n<li>WAS has parent first class loaders as described here - <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was/8.5.5?topic=loading-configuring-class-loaders-server\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/was/8.5.5?topic=loading-configuring-class-loaders-server</a>.

I don't think this is the issue because my app has jackson 2.11 &amp; WAS had jackson 1.6.2.

The IP cameras are linked to a server (Gateway Server as they call it) that serves a `REST API`. In essence I have to implement a reduced number of features like live view, list the recorded files for a camera, record on demand, alarm managing and downloading files.

Since we are not handling it, DefaultErrorHandler by Apache Camel handles it.</p>\n<p>The error log like this on the server:</p>\n<pre><code> main 2022-08-05 15:24:43.537 ERROR [user-manager] 1 --- [nio-8080-exec-5] o.a.c.p.e.DefaultErrorHandler            : Failed delivery for (MessageId:-0000000 on Exc │    │\n│ main +[                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      │    │\n│ main +[ Message History (complete message history is disabled)                                                                                                                                                                               │    │\n│ main +[ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                              │    │\n│ main +[ RouteId              ProcessorId          Processor                                                                        Elapsed (ms)                                                                                              │    │\n│ main +[ [PostUserToIdentity] [PostUserToIdentity] [from[direct://business.postUserToIdentity]                                    ] [        27]                                                                                              │    │\n│ main +[     ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                              │    │\n│ main +[ [PostUserToIdentity] [to58              ] [direct:postUserToIdentityRequestedInternal                                    ] [         0]                                                                                              │    │\n│ main +[                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      │    │\n│ main +[ Stacktrace                                                                                                                                                                                                                           │    │\n│ main +[ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                              │    │\n│ main +[                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      │    │\n│ main                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         │    │\n│ main com.user.manager.exception.ConflictException: User already exists         \n</code></pre>\n<p>So, I wrote a Custom Handler and a RouteClass which extends the <strong>RouteBuilder</strong> with the proper Camel <strong>OnException</strong> clause.</p>\n<p><strong>OnConflictExceptionRoute Class</strong></p>\n<pre><code>@Component\npublic class OnConflictExceptionRoute extends RouteBuilder {\n\n    @Override\n    public void configure() {\n        log.info(&quot;Configuring extended create user by context route&quot;);\n\n        onException(ConflictException.class)\n            .process(new ConflictExceptionHandler())\n            .handled(true);\n\n        from(&quot;direct:business.postUserToIdentity&quot;)\n            .routeId(&quot;PostUserToIdentity&quot;)\n            .onException(ConflictException.class)\n            .process(new ConflictExceptionHandler());\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Custom Error Handler</strong></p>\n<pre><code>@Slf4j\npublic class ConflictExceptionHandler implements Processor {\n\n    @Override\n    public void process(Exchange exchange) {\n        log.info(&quot;USER ALREADY EXISTS!&quot;);\n        throw new ConflictException().withMessage(&quot;USER ALREADY EXISTS!&quot;);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>At the application startup, I could see that the Configure method in the RouteClass is triggered.</p>\n<p>But when I am triggering the flow, I am still seeing the same error is handling by the DefaultErrorHandler.</p>\n<p>Why it is not working?

Check the Classpath (correct version of JAXB (jaxb-api and jaxb-impl) is on your classpath. )\r\n 2. Inspect Generated XML (verify that the generated XML indeed contains the &lt;request&gt; element by examining the output or using a\r\n    tool to pretty-print the XML.
