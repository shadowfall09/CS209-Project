made a class named `LocalChunkSender` implementing an interface named `ChunkSender`. \r\nA `ChunkSender` exposes a 16KB `ByteBuffer` for other classes to fill it with data and then writes this buffer into a `java.nio.channels.WritableByteChannel` which writes into a local file (the *chunk-file*).\r\nWhen the other class decides that enough bytes have been stored into the current chunk-file, it commands the ChunkSender to close the current chunk-file, to open a new one and the story goes on.\r\n\r\nHere are the key methods of an abstract BaseChunkSender:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\npublic void sendChunkBuffer(DataChunk chunk) throws IOException {\r\n    if (currentChunk == null) {\r\n        currentChunk = chunk;\r\n        checkSum = 0;\r\n        checkedOutputStream = new CheckedOutputStream(createChunkStream(chunk), new CRC32());\r\n        outChannel = Channels.newChannel(checkedOutputStream);\r\n    }\r\n    outChannel.write(buffer);\r\n    buffer.clear();\r\n}\r\n\r\nprotected abstract OutputStream createChunkStream(DataChunk chunk) throws IOException;\r\n```\r\nThe `createChunkStream()` method is implemented by the `LocalChunkSender` and provides the `OutputStream` to be used by the `WritableByteChannel`.\r\n\r\nNow I want to make another ChunkSender implementation sending out the ByteBuffer data to a remote REST service through POST.\r\nI think I should use an `org.springframework.http.RequestEntity&lt;InputStreamResource&gt;` constructed from an `org.springframework.core.io.InputStreamResource`, but here is the problem: \r\nmy `ChunkSender` does not have any `InputStream` for an `InputStreamResource` because receives data through its 16KB `ByteBuffer` which is supposed to be written in a `WritableByteChannel`.\r\nI want to avoid to store the full chunk-file in memory, or as a temporary file, and then send it as a normal `MultiPartFile` in a POST because this would take too much memory and time.\r\n\r\nSo my question: is it possible and reasonable to build an `InputStreamResource` fed ciclically by a `ByteBuffer` and then use it (even in a separate thread) to make the body of the `RequestEntity`?\r\nOr is

Funny enough it didn&#39;t happen on my original test, it only seems to be happening now. Most answers like this one (such as [this one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50642177/gradle-build-resource-androidstyle-textappearance-material-not-found), or [this one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42144415/error-retrieving-parent-for-item-no-resource-found-that-matches-the-given-name)), all pretty much advise to bump up the SDK compiling version. I&#39;m unfortunately not able to do this since the board won&#39;t run that code. Plus it all seems to be related to the &quot;look&quot; of the application, which is something that I&#39;m willing to change.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated!

This is where I run into this problem:</p>\n<pre><code>Android resource linking failed\nerror: resource android:style/TextAppearance.Material.Widget.Button.Borderless.Colored not found.\nerror: resource android:style/TextAppearance.Material.Widget.Button.Colored not found.\nerror: resource android:style/TextAppearance.Material.Widget.Button.Inverse not found.\norg.newroads.boardconnectionsclient.app-mergeDebugResources-11:/values-v26/values-v26.xml:7: error: resource android:attr/colorError not found.\norg.newroads.boardconnectionsclient.app-mergeDebugResources-11:/values-v26/values-v26.xml:7: error: resource android:attr/colorError not found.\norg.newroads.boardconnectionsclient.app-mergeDebugResources-11:/values-v26/values-v26.xml:11: error: resource android:attr/colorError not found.\norg.newroads.boardconnectionsclient.app-mergeDebugResources-11:/values-v26/values-v26.xml:11: error: resource android:attr/colorError not found.\norg.newroads.boardconnectionsclient.app-mergeDebugResources-11:/values-v26/values-v26.xml:15: error: style attribute 'android:attr/keyboardNavigationCluster' not found.\norg.newroads.boardconnectionsclient.app-mergeDebugResources-11:/values-v28/values-v28.xml:7: error: resource android:attr/dialogCornerRadius not found.\norg.newroads.boardconnectionsclient.app-mergeDebugResources-11:/values-v28/values-v28.xml:7: error: resource android:attr/dialogCornerRadius not found.\norg.newroads.boardconnectionsclient.app-mergeDebugResources-11:/values-v28/values-v28.xml:11: error: resource android:attr/dialogCornerRadius not found.\norg.newroads.boardconnectionsclient.app-mergeDebugResources-11:/values-v28/values-v28.xml:11: error: resource android:attr/dialogCornerRadius not found.\nerror: resource android:style/Widget.Material.Button.Colored not found.\norg.newroads.boardconnectionsclient.app-mergeDebugResources-11:/values-v23/values-v23.xml:39: error: resource android:attr/colorBackgroundFloating not found.\norg.newroads.boardconnectionsclient.app-mergeDebugResources-11:/values-v23/values-v23.xml:39: error: resource android:attr/colorBackgroundFloating not found.\norg.newroads.boardconnectionsclient.app-mergeDebugResources-11:/values/values.xml:3238: error: resource android:attr/fontStyle not found.\norg.newroads.boardconnectionsclient.app-mergeDebugResources-11:/values/values.xml:3239: error: resource android:attr/font not found.\norg.newroads.boardconnectionsclient.app-mergeDebugResources-11:/values/values.xml:3240: error: resource android:attr/fontWeight not found.\norg.newroads.boardconnectionsclient.app-mergeDebugResources-11:/values/values.xml:3241: error: resource android:attr/fontVariationSettings not found.\norg.newroads.boardconnectionsclient.app-mergeDebugResources-11:/values/values.xml:3242: error: resource android:attr/ttcIndex not found.\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, based on my research, all the declarations that neem to be missing are for Button decorations and how they display. Now, I had to make some changes to the gradle to work. My original SDK 24 gradle is:</p>\n<pre><code>android {\n    namespace 'org.newroads.boardconnectionsclient'\n    compileSdk 28\n    lintOptions {\n        abortOnError false\n        disable 'ExpiredTargetSdkVersion'\n    }\n    defaultConfig {\n        applicationId &quot;org.newroads.boardconnectionsclient&quot;\n        minSdk 21\n        targetSdk 26\n        versionCode 5\n        versionName &quot;1.3&quot;\n        ndk {\n            abiFilters &quot;armeabi-v7a&quot;, &quot;arm64-v8a&quot;, &quot;x86_64&quot;, &quot;x86&quot;\n        }\n\n    }\n\ndependencies {\n\n    implementation 'androidx.leanback:leanback:1.0.0'\n    implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])\n    implementation 'com.pusher:pusher-java-client:2.4.4'\n    implementation 'androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.1.4'\n    implementation 'androidx.cardview:cardview:1.0.0'\n    implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer:2.15.1'\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And my SDK 21 is now:</p>\n<pre><code>android {\n    namespace 'org.newroads.boardconnectionsclient'\n    compileSdk 21\n    lintOptions {\n        abortOnError false\n        disable 'ExpiredTargetSdkVersion'\n    }\n    defaultConfig {\n        applicationId &quot;org.newroads.boardconnectionsclient&quot;\n        minSdk 21\n        targetSdk 21\n        multiDexEnabled true\n        versionCode 5\n        versionName &quot;1.3&quot;\n        ndk {\n            abiFilters &quot;armeabi-v7a&quot;, &quot;arm64-v8a&quot;, &quot;x86_64&quot;, &quot;x86&quot;\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    compileOptions {\n        // Flag to enable support for the new language APIs\n        coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true\n        // Sets Java compatibility to Java 8\n        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8\n        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8\n    }\ndependencies {\n    coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.0.2'\n    implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])\n    implementation 'com.pusher:pusher-java-client:2.4.4'\n    implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:21.0.3'\n    implementation 'com.android.support:cardview-v7:21.0.3'\n    implementation 'com.android.support.constraint:constraint-layout:2.0.4'\n    implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer-core:2.15.1'\n    implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer-ui:2.15.1'\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've gone through all my GUI declarations, which only happen in two files, and updated my themes.xml to be:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;resources&gt;\n\n    &lt;style name=&quot;Theme.BoardConnectionsClient&quot; parent=&quot;@style/Theme.AppCompat&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/resources&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have tried overriding themes on buttons as well as other elements, but I'm not sure why the error is there. Funny enough it didn't happen on my original test, it only seems to be happening now. Most answers like this one (such as <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50642177/gradle-build-resource-androidstyle-textappearance-material-not-found\">this one</a>, or <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42144415/error-retrieving-parent-for-item-no-resource-found-that-matches-the-given-name\">this one</a>), all pretty much advise to bump up the SDK compiling version. I'm unfortunately not able to do this since the board won't run that code. Plus it all seems to be related to the &quot;look&quot; of the application, which is something that I'm willing to change.</p>\n<p>Any help is appreciated! Thank you!!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","multithreading","mergesort","java-threads"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2053598,"reputation":41316,"user_id":1831987,"display_name":"VGR"},"score":4,"creation_date":1679687949,"post_id":75837669,"comment_id":133772054,"body_markdown":"Merely creating a Thread object does not start a new thread.

The most common way to set a default error page has always been the `SimpleMappingExceptionResolver` (since Spring V1 in fact). However Spring Boot also provides for a fallback error-handling page.\r\n\r\nAt start-up, Spring Boot tries to find a mapping for `/error`. By convention, a URL ending in `/error` maps to a logical view of the same name: `error`. Generally this view maps in turn to the `error.html` Thymeleaf template. (If using JSP, it would map to `error.jsp` according to the setup of your\r\nInternalResourceViewResolver).\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring Boot will automatically use and configure Thymeleaf as the view rendering engine, as long as it&#39;s on the classpath. \r\n\r\n**Thymeleaf with Maven:**\r\n\r\nMake sure you have Maven 3 installed with the following command: mvn --version. Navigate to the directory you want to create your project in and execute Maven archtetype:\r\n\r\n    mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DgroupId=pl.codeleak.demos.sbt -DartifactId=spring-boot-thymeleaf -interactiveMode=false\r\n\r\nThe above command will create a new directory spring-boot-thymeleaf. Now you can import it to your IDE.\r\nThe next step is to configure the application.

The most common way to set a default error page has always been the <code>SimpleMappingExceptionResolver</code> (since Spring V1 in fact). However Spring Boot also provides for a fallback error-handling page.</p>\n\n<p>At start-up, Spring Boot tries to find a mapping for <code>/error</code>. By convention, a URL ending in <code>/error</code> maps to a logical view of the same name: <code>error</code>. Generally this view maps in turn to the <code>error.html</code> Thymeleaf template. (If using JSP, it would map to <code>error.jsp</code> according to the setup of your\nInternalResourceViewResolver).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Spring Boot will automatically use and configure Thymeleaf as the view rendering engine, as long as it's on the classpath. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Thymeleaf with Maven:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have Maven 3 installed with the following command: mvn --version. Navigate to the directory you want to create your project in and execute Maven archtetype:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DgroupId=pl.codeleak.demos.sbt -DartifactId=spring-boot-thymeleaf -interactiveMode=false\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above command will create a new directory spring-boot-thymeleaf. Now you can import it to your IDE.\nThe next step is to configure the application. Open pom.xml and add a parent project:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;parent&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1.1.8.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/parent&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Values from the parent project will be the default for this project if they are left unspecified.\nThe next step is to add web dependencies.

I may help you! I&#39;ve been there: I searched through the internet and was growing pretty desperate, but then I did this, and the problem vanished &#128588;\r\n\r\n 1. **You must have this Tomcat dependency**\r\n```\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.tomcat.embed&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;tomcat-embed-jasper&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n```\r\nNotice that it has a default scope. The default scope is `compile`. It is important that you have this scope!\r\n\r\n 2. **You should have these JSP/JSTL dependencies**, both of them (at least, if you use something like a `forEach` tag)!\r\n```\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;3.0.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n            &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.glassfish.web&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;3.0.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n            &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n```\r\nNotice that they belong to the `jakarta` package. In my case, it was important! Maybe, it may be important in your case too. Before I migrated my project to Spring Boot, I used `javax` dependencies, specifically these two\r\n```\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;javax.servlet&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;javax.servlet-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;3.1.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n            &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;javax.servlet&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jstl&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;1.2&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhen trying to open my home page with those dependencies, I received error 500\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.TagLibraryValidator\r\n```\r\nI added some more `javax` dependencies to appease Spring a little\r\n```\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;javax.servlet.jsp.jstl&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jstl-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;1.2&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;javax.servlet.jsp&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jsp-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;2.2&lt;/version&gt;\r\n            &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n```\r\nand it still didn&#39;t work in Spring Boot! This time, I received `ClassCastException` because apparently Spring needed something specifically from the `jakarta` package\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: class org.apache.taglibs.standard.tlv.JstlCoreTLV cannot be cast to class jakarta.servlet.jsp.tagext.TagLibraryValidator (org.apache.taglibs.standard.tlv.JstlCoreTLV and jakarta.servlet.jsp.tagext.TagLibraryValidator are in unnamed module of loader &#39;app&#39;)\r\n```\r\n 3. **MOST IMPORTANTLY! It appears you do need a `webapp` package when working with JSP views!** I thought that since it&#39;s Spring Boot, I don&#39;t need that directory and may place my views in the `resources/templates` folder as HTML/Thymeleaf folks do. BIG MISTAKE! Even when my properties looked like this\r\n```\r\nspring.mvc.view.prefix=/templates/\r\nspring.mvc.view.suffix= .jsp\r\n```\r\nor like this\r\n```\r\nspring.mvc.view.prefix=classpath:/templates/\r\nspring.mvc.view.suffix= .jsp\r\n```\r\nin fact, any way you could imagine (I tried to describe the directory in all possible ways), I still got that pesky 404! Not before I created a `webapp` directory had I managed to get rid of that problem\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nNotice that tiny bluish circle on the `webapp` folder icon. I have a suspicion that it&#39;s important. As a matter of fact, I *did* try to create such a directory before, but it didn&#39;t have that little circle and moving my JSPs there had no effect on my 404. Why it didn&#39;t have that circle the first time? I don&#39;t know! But at any rate I suspect that the `webapp` package should be in the same directory as your *source root*. In this case, it&#39;s the `java` package. So since it&#39;s in the `main` folder, your `webapp` directory should be in the `main` folder too\r\n\r\nFun fact! My favicon and CSS stylesheet are still in the `resources` directory (that is, in the `resources/static` directory)! Despite that, Spring has no problem figuring out where they are. So the webapp package is necessary only for your JSPs (perhaps, you can store CSSs and favicons there too, I didn&#39;t try it, but at least you don&#39;t have to)\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nWhy it works this way with JSP? Search me! I have no idea at all! But it&#39;s what helped me and what you should apparently do too if you experience the same issue\r\n\r\nYou can get in touch with me and request the project&#39;s repo if that&#39;s something you need &#128076;\r\n\r\n**UPD:** A quick note. Some folks [maintain][4] that you need to have a WAR package for JSP projects. It doesn&#39;t appear so! But keep it in mind anyway.

But the page still opens! So since you apparently don&#39;t need WAR packaging, you also shouldn&#39;t be concerned about the blue circle. I take that back! Or maybe, the circle has nothing to do with WAR at all as I briefly returned that property and clean-installed the project, and it didn&#39;t appear again &#129335;‍♂️\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][7]][7]\r\n\r\n**UPD3:** By the way, that underlining never went away.

It is important that you have this scope!</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>You should have these JSP/JSTL dependencies</strong>, both of them (at least, if you use something like a <code>forEach</code> tag)!</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;version&gt;3.0.0&lt;/version&gt;\n            &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.glassfish.web&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;version&gt;3.0.1&lt;/version&gt;\n            &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that they belong to the <code>jakarta</code> package. In my case, it was important! Maybe, it may be important in your case too. Before I migrated my project to Spring Boot, I used <code>javax</code> dependencies, specifically these two</p>\n<pre><code>        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;javax.servlet&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;javax.servlet-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;version&gt;3.1.0&lt;/version&gt;\n            &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n    \n        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;javax.servlet&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jstl&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;version&gt;1.2&lt;/version&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>When trying to open my home page with those dependencies, I received error 500</p>\n<pre><code>java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.TagLibraryValidator\n</code></pre>\n<p>I added some more <code>javax</code> dependencies to appease Spring a little</p>\n<pre><code>        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;javax.servlet.jsp.jstl&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jstl-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;version&gt;1.2&lt;/version&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;javax.servlet.jsp&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jsp-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;version&gt;2.2&lt;/version&gt;\n            &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>and it still didn't work in Spring Boot! This time, I received <code>ClassCastException</code> because apparently Spring needed something specifically from the <code>jakarta</code> package</p>\n<pre><code>java.lang.ClassCastException: class org.apache.taglibs.standard.tlv.JstlCoreTLV cannot be cast to class jakarta.servlet.jsp.tagext.TagLibraryValidator (org.apache.taglibs.standard.tlv.JstlCoreTLV and jakarta.servlet.jsp.tagext.TagLibraryValidator are in unnamed module of loader 'app')\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>MOST IMPORTANTLY! It appears you do need a <code>webapp</code> package when working with JSP views!</strong> I thought that since it's Spring Boot, I don't need that directory and may place my views in the <code>resources/templates</code> folder as HTML/Thymeleaf folks do. BIG MISTAKE! Even when my properties looked like this</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>spring.mvc.view.prefix=/templates/\nspring.mvc.view.suffix= .jsp\n</code></pre>\n<p>or like this</p>\n<pre><code>spring.mvc.view.prefix=classpath:/templates/\nspring.mvc.view.suffix= .jsp\n</code></pre>\n<p>in fact, any way you could imagine (I tried to describe the directory in all possible ways), I still got that pesky 404! Not before I created a <code>webapp</code> directory had I managed to get rid of that problem</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nBZRX.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nBZRX.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Notice that tiny bluish circle on the <code>webapp</code> folder icon. I have a suspicion that it's important. As a matter of fact, I <em>did</em> try to create such a directory before, but it didn't have that little circle and moving my JSPs there had no effect on my 404. Why it didn't have that circle the first time? I don't know! But at any rate I suspect that the <code>webapp</code> package should be in the same directory as your <em>source root</em>. In this case, it's the <code>java</code> package. So since it's in the <code>main</code> folder, your <code>webapp</code> directory should be in the <code>main</code> folder too</p>\n<p>Fun fact! My favicon and CSS stylesheet are still in the <code>resources</code> directory (that is, in the <code>resources/static</code> directory)! Despite that, Spring has no problem figuring out where they are. So the webapp package is necessary only for your JSPs (perhaps, you can store CSSs and favicons there too, I didn't try it, but at least you don't have to)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5FWaw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5FWaw.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F4s7K.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F4s7K.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Why it works this way with JSP?

The schema provides the namespace `&quot;my.namespace/Invoices&quot;` which **JAXB** uses to create the Java `package` name using its own naming convention.\r\n\r\nAs an option, a more advanced implementation of Java&#39;s built-in `Object` methods are generated using these **XJC** [hisrc-basicjaxb-plugins][10]. In particular, the sample project uses the `toString` plugin to display *human-readable* representations of the unmarshaled `Invoice` objects.\r\n\r\n**hisrc-basicjaxb-plugins**\r\n~~~\r\n&lt;args&gt;\r\n    &lt;arg&gt;-no-header&lt;/arg&gt;\r\n    &lt;arg&gt;-XhashCode&lt;/arg&gt;\r\n    &lt;arg&gt;-Xequals&lt;/arg&gt;\r\n    &lt;arg&gt;-XtoString&lt;/arg&gt;\r\n&lt;/args&gt;\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n&gt; *Note:* When the **XJC** [hisrc-basicjaxb-plugins][10] are used, the [hisrc-basicjaxb-runtime][10] dependency is required on the run-time class path.\r\n\r\n##### Testing\r\n\r\nThe JUnit test class, [InvoicesTest.java][7], scans for the sample files and invokes the method `checkSample(File sample)` to provide each file to the tester. For this project, a `JAXBContext` is created and each file in the [samples][8] path is *unmarshaled* to a `InvoiceList` object. When successful, each object is *marshaled* for logging and your [review][2].\r\n\r\n##### Demonstration\r\n\r\nA Java standard engine application with a constructor as provided by the OP and a `main(...)` method is at [`namespace.my.invoices.Aufgabe4`][11].\r\n\r\n~~~\r\npublic Aufgabe4(String path) throws JAXBException\r\n{\r\n    File f = new File(path);\r\n    JAXBContext context = JAXBContext.newInstance(ObjectFactory.class);\r\n    Unmarshaller unmarshaller = context.createUnmarshaller();\r\n    InvoiceList invoiceList = (InvoiceList) JAXBIntrospector.getValue( unmarshaller.unmarshal(f));\r\n    setInvoices(invoiceList);\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThis application is executed using:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nmvn compile exec:java &quot;src/test/samples/Invoices01-1.xml&quot;\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- References --&gt;\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/patrodyne/hisrc-higherjaxb/releases/download/2.1.0/hisrc-higherjaxb-sample-invoices-2.1.0-mvn-src.zip\r\n[2]: https://github.com/patrodyne/hisrc-higherjaxb/blob/master/assembly/samples/invoices/OUTPUT.txt\r\n[3]: https://github.com/patrodyne/hisrc-higherjaxb/blob/master/assembly/samples/invoices/project-pom.xml\r\n[4]: https://github.com/patrodyne/hisrc-higherjaxb/blob/master/assembly/samples/invoices/src/main/resources/Invoices.xsd\r\n[5]: https://github.com/patrodyne/hisrc-higherjaxb/blob/master/assembly/samples/invoices/src/test/samples/Invoices01-1.xml\r\n[6]: https://github.com/patrodyne/hisrc-higherjaxb/blob/master/assembly/samples/invoices/src/main/resources/Invoices.xjb\r\n[7]: https://github.com/patrodyne/hisrc-higherjaxb/blob/master/assembly/samples/invoices/src/test/java/namespace/my/invoices/InvoicesTest.java\r\n[8]: https://github.com/patrodyne/hisrc-higherjaxb/tree/master/assembly/samples/invoices/src/test/samples\r\n[9]: https://github.com/patrodyne/hisrc-higherjaxb#readme\r\n[10]: https://github.com/patrodyne/hisrc-basicjaxb#readme\r\n[11]: https://github.com/patrodyne/hisrc-higherjaxb/blob/master/assembly/samples/invoices/src/main/java/namespace/my/invoices/Aufgabe4.java\r\n","title":"Exception at Unmarshalling an XML with JAXB","body":"<h3>Solution</h3>\n<p>Reading an XML file via <strong>JAXB</strong> and generated objects based on an XSD.</p>\n<p>Use <strong>JAXB</strong> to generate Java classes from XML Schema file(s) using its <strong>XJC</strong> compiler.

The schema provides the namespace <code>&quot;my.namespace/Invoices&quot;</code> which <strong>JAXB</strong> uses to create the Java <code>package</code> name using its own naming convention.</p>\n<p>As an option, a more advanced implementation of Java's built-in <code>Object</code> methods are generated using these <strong>XJC</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/patrodyne/hisrc-basicjaxb#readme\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hisrc-basicjaxb-plugins</a>. In particular, the sample project uses the <code>toString</code> plugin to display <em>human-readable</em> representations of the unmarshaled <code>Invoice</code> objects.</p>\n<p><strong>hisrc-basicjaxb-plugins</strong></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;args&gt;\n    &lt;arg&gt;-no-header&lt;/arg&gt;\n    &lt;arg&gt;-XhashCode&lt;/arg&gt;\n    &lt;arg&gt;-Xequals&lt;/arg&gt;\n    &lt;arg&gt;-XtoString&lt;/arg&gt;\n&lt;/args&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Note:</em> When the <strong>XJC</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/patrodyne/hisrc-basicjaxb#readme\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hisrc-basicjaxb-plugins</a> are used, the <a href=\"https://github.com/patrodyne/hisrc-basicjaxb#readme\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hisrc-basicjaxb-runtime</a> dependency is required on the run-time class path.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5>Testing</h5>\n<p>The JUnit test class, <a href=\"https://github.com/patrodyne/hisrc-higherjaxb/blob/master/assembly/samples/invoices/src/test/java/namespace/my/invoices/InvoicesTest.java\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">InvoicesTest.java</a>, scans for the sample files and invokes the method <code>checkSample(File sample)</code> to provide each file to the tester.
