It is a type of [Message Authentication Code (MAC)][2].\r\n\r\nThe latter link explains the difference between a signature and a MAC this way:\r\n\r\n&gt; MACs differ from digital signatures as MAC values are both generated\r\n&gt; and verified using the same secret key. This implies that the sender\r\n&gt; and receiver of a message must agree on the same key before initiating\r\n&gt; communications, as is the case with symmetric encryption. For the same\r\n&gt; reason, MACs do not provide the property of non-repudiation offered by\r\n&gt; signatures specifically in the case of a network-wide shared secret\r\n&gt; key: any user who can verify a MAC is also capable of generating MACs\r\n&gt; for other messages. In contrast, a digital signature is generated\r\n&gt; using the private key of a key pair, which is asymmetric encryption.\r\n&gt; Since this private key is only accessible to its holder, a digital\r\n&gt; signature proves that a document was signed by none other than that\r\n&gt; holder. Thus, digital signatures do offer non-repudiation. However,\r\n&gt; non-repudiation can be provided by systems that securely bind key\r\n&gt; usage information to the MAC key; the same key is in possession of two\r\n&gt; people, but one has a copy of the key that can be used for MAC\r\n&gt; generation while the other has a copy of the key in a hardware\r\n&gt; security module that only permits MAC verification. This is commonly\r\n&gt; done in the finance industry.\r\n\r\nSo in order to verify an HMAC, you need to share the key that was used to generate it.  You would send the message, the HMAC, and the receiver would have the same key you used to generate the HMAC.  They could then use the same algorithm to generate an HMAC from your message, and it should match the HMAC you sent.  Public/private keys (assymetric) are not used for this.  You need to generate a symmetric key (like AES) and securely share that with the people that will be generating/verifying the HMAC.\r\n\r\nThis limits the HMAC to having `integrity` and `authenticity` properties only, and not `non-repudiation`.  \r\n\r\nThe quote above mentioned that hardware security modules could be used to enforce the key use, and then you could get non-repudiation as long as only one person could use the key for generating the HMAC.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could use a hybrid approach.  Use a shared symmetric key to generate the HMAC.  The HMAC in the end is a hash.  You could then sign this hash with your private key (different than the key used in the HMAC).  A third party with the symmetric key and your public key could verify you signed the HMAC, and could generate their own HMAC with the message and the shared key to make sure it matched.  This would also give you non-repudiation.\r\n\r\nIf you want to go this route, use the Java [Signature][3] class.  The HMAC algorithm is SHA-1, and assuming your keypair is RSA, you could use the `NONEwithRSA` Signature algorithm since the input is already a SHA-1 hash.  Or you could hash it again with the `SHA1withRSA` algorithm.  As long as you generate the signature and verify with the same algorithm, it should be OK.\r\n\r\n\t\tbyte[] data = hmac.getBytes(&quot;UTF-8&quot;);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSignature mySig = Signature.getInstance(&quot;NONEwithRSA&quot;);\r\n\r\n\t\tmySig.initSign(myPrivateKey);\r\n\r\n\t\tmySig.update(data);\r\n\r\n\t\tbyte[] sigBytes = mySig.sign();\r\n\r\n\t\t// And to verify.\r\n\r\n\t\tSignature mySig2 = Signature.getInstance(&quot;NONEwithRSA&quot;);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tmySig2.initVerify(myPublicKey);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tboolean isSigValid = mySig2.verify(sigBytes);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code\r\n  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code\r\n  [3]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/security/Signature.html","title":"Verifying HMAC SHA1 signature in Java","body":"<p>First to clarify, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code\" rel=\"noreferrer\">HMAC</a> code does not generate a signature.

This can be done to compare different representations for equivalence, to count the number of distinct data structures, to improve the efficiency of various algorithms by eliminating repeated calculations, or to make it possible to impose a meaningful sorting order.\r\n\r\nThe **Unicode** example made the most sense to me:\r\n\r\n&gt; Variable-length encodings in the Unicode standard, in particular UTF-8, have more than one possible encoding for most common characters. This makes string validation more complicated, since every possible encoding of each string character must be considered. A software implementation which does not consider all character encodings runs the risk of accepting strings considered invalid in the application design, which could cause bugs or allow attacks. The solution is to allow a single encoding for each character. Canonicalization is then the process of translating every string character to its single allowed encoding.

This can be done to compare different representations for equivalence, to count the number of distinct data structures, to improve the efficiency of various algorithms by eliminating repeated calculations, or to make it possible to impose a meaningful sorting order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <strong>Unicode</strong> example made the most sense to me:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Variable-length encodings in the Unicode standard, in particular UTF-8, have more than one possible encoding for most common characters. This makes string validation more complicated, since every possible encoding of each string character must be considered. A software implementation which does not consider all character encodings runs the risk of accepting strings considered invalid in the application design, which could cause bugs or allow attacks. The solution is to allow a single encoding for each character. Canonicalization is then the process of translating every string character to its single allowed encoding. An alternative is for software to determine whether a string is canonicalized, and then reject it if it is not. In this case, in a client/server context, the canonicalization would be the responsibility of the client.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In summary, a standard form of representation for data.

This is a show-stopper for most people as you have to understand the byte code and a little bit of the [JVMS][2] to use it properly. But mastering ASM is most certainly very interesting. Note however that while there is a **great** [ASM 4 guide][3], in some part of the API the javadoc documentation can be very concise if it is present at all, but it is being improved. It closely follows JVM versions to support new features, however it has a downside is cannot handle well byte codes from the next JDK release and as such may require to wait for a release supporting those.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you need full control, ASM is your weapon of choice.\r\n\r\nThis project sees regular updates ; at the time of this edit version 9.6 was released on 30 September 2023, with supports for JDK 22 opcodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Byte Buddy][4] [tag:byte-buddy]\r\n--------------------------------\r\nByte Buddy is a rather new library but provides any functionality that CGLIB or Javassist provides and much more. Byte Buddy can be fully customised down to the byte code level and comes with an expressive domain specific language that allows for very readable code.\r\n\r\n - It supports all JVM bytecode versions, including Java 8 semantic changes of some opcodes regarding default methods.\r\n - ByteBuddy don&#39;t seem to suffer from the drawbacks other libraries have\r\n - Highly configurable\r\n - Quite fast ([benchmark][5] [code][6])\r\n - Type safe fluent API\r\n - Type safe callbacks\r\n\r\n   &gt; Javassist advices or custom instrumentation code is based on code in a plain `String` thus type check and debugging is impossible within this code, while ByteBuddy allows to write those with pure Java hence enforces type checks and allows debugging.\r\n\r\n\r\n - Annotation driven (flexible)\r\n\r\n   &gt; The user callbacks can be configured with annotations allowing to receive the wanted parameters in the callback.\r\n\r\n - Available as an agent\r\n\r\n   &gt; The nifty agent builder allows ByteBuddy to be used as a pure agent or as attaching agent.\r\n\r\n   Note that since JDK 21, the JDK is gearing toward _integrity by default_, meaning that dynamic attachment will be disabled by default ([JEP-451][7]), for serviceability agent the adding `-XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading`, however for libraries that require an agent to work, they must be declared on the command line using `-javaagent:path/to/jar`.\r\n\r\n - Very well documented\r\n - Lots of example\r\n - Clean code, ~94% test coverage\r\n - Android DEX support\r\n \r\nThe main downside perhaps, would the API is a bit verbose for a beginner but it is designed as an opt-in API shaped as a proxy generation DSL ; there&#39;s no magic or questionable defaults. When manipulating byte code it is probably the most safe and the most reasonable choice. Also with multiple examples and a big tutorial this is not a real issue.\r\n\r\nIn October 2015 this projects received the [Oracle Duke&#39;s choice award][8]. The latest release at the time of this edit is [1.14.9][9], and ships with ASM 9.6 with preliminary JDK 22 support.\r\n\r\nNote that [tag:mockito] has replaced [CGLIB by Byte Buddy][10] in version 2.1.0.\r\n\r\n[The JDK&#39;s classfile API (JEP-456)][11]\r\n---------------------------------------\r\nThe authors of the JDK have been working on an API within the JDK, the JEP mentions the [java.lang.classfile][12] package.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to provide an API based on today&#39;s challenge for the JDK, as classfile is evolving faster than in 2002 when ASM was designed. THE JDK authors wanted to start from a fresh perspective when they created this API, instead of taking ownership of the old ASM codebase (A significant difference might be that ASM does very few allocations, while Classfile API might do a lot more, but the tradeoff are gained elsewhere ([source][13]).).\r\n\r\nAt the time of this edit the Classfile API JEP is not yet targeted for JDK 22, but is likely to land on the JDK at some point, in preview at first. \r\n\r\nThis API is an alternative to ASM, and may support additional features, but it won;t offer the higher level features that ByteBuddy provides, and certainly won&#39;t help for Android developers.\r\n\r\n[Javassist][14] [tag:javassist]\r\n------------------------------\r\nThe javadoc of Javassist is way better than that of CGLIB. The class engineering API is OK, but Javassist is not perfect either. In particular, the `ProxyFactory` which is the equivalent of the CGLIB&#39;s `Enhancer` suffer from some drawbacks too, just to list a few :\r\n\r\n - Bridge method are not fully supported (ie the one that are generated for covariant return types)\r\n - `ClassloaderProvider` is a static field instead, then it applies to all instances within the same classloader\r\n - Custom naming could have been welcome (with checks for signed jars)\r\n - There is no extension point and almost all methods of interest are private, which is cumbersome if we want to change some behavior\r\n - While Javassist offer support for annotation attributes in classes, they are not supported in `ProxyFactory`.\r\n\r\nOn the aspect oriented side, one can inject code in a proxy, but this approach in Javassist is limited and a bit error-prone :\r\n\r\n - aspect code is written in a plain Java String that is _compiled_ in opcodes\r\n - no type check\r\n - no generics\r\n - no lambda\r\n - no auto-(un)boxing\r\n\r\nAlso Javassist is recognized to be slower than Cglib. This is mainly due to its approach of reading class files instead of reading loaded classes such as CGLIB does. And the [implementation][15] itself is hard to read to be fair ; if one requires to make changes in the Javassist code there&#39;s many chances to break something.\r\n\r\nJavassist suffered from inactivity as well, their move to [github circa 2013][16] seem to have proven useful as it shows regular commits and pull requests from the community.\r\n\r\nThese limitations still stand in the version 3.17.1. Version has been bumped to version 3.20.0, yet it seems Javassist may still have issues with Java 8 support.\r\n\r\n[JiteScript][17]\r\n---------------\r\nJiteScript does seem like a new piece of nicely shaping up DSL for ASM, this is based on the latest ASM release (4.0). The code looks clean.\r\n\r\n**But** the project is still in his early age so API / behavior can change, plus the documentation is dire. And updates scarce if not abandoned.\r\n\r\n[Proxetta][18] [tag:jodd]\r\n------------------------\r\nThis is a rather new tool but it offers the by far best _human_ API. It allows for different types of proxies such as subclass proxies (cglib approach) or weaving or delegation.\r\n\r\nAlthough, this one is rather rare, no information exists if it works well. There are so many corner case to deal with when dealing with bytecode.\r\n\r\n[AspectJ][19] [tag:aspectj]\r\n--------------------------\r\nAspectJ is a very powerful tool for **aspect-oriented programming** (only). AspectJ manipulates byte code to achieve its goals such that you might be able to achieve your goals with it. However, this requires manipulation at compile-time; spring offer weaving at load time via an agent since version [2.5][20], [4.1.x][21].\r\n\r\n[CGLIB][22] [tag:cglib]\r\n-----------------------\r\n_A word about CGLIB that has been updated since that question has been asked._\r\n\r\nCGLIB is quite fast, it is one of the main reason why it is still around, along with the fact that CGLIB worked almost better than any alternatives until now (2014-2015).\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking libraries that allow the rewriting of classes at run time have to avoid loading any types before the corresponding class is rewritten. Therefore, they cannot make use of the Java reflection API which requires that any type used in reflection is loaded. Instead, they have to read the class files via IO (which is a performance-breaker). This makes for example Javassist or Proxetta significantly slower than Cglib which simply reads the methods via the reflection API and overrides them. \r\n\r\n&lt;s&gt;However, CGLIB is no longer under active development. There were recent releases but those changes were seen as insignificant by many and most people did never update to version 3 since CGLIB introduced some [severe bugs][23] in the last releases what did not really build up confidence.&lt;/s&gt; Version 3.1 fixed a lot of the woes of version 3.0 (since version 4.0.3 Spring framework repackages [version 3.1][24]).\r\n\r\nAlso, the CGLIB source code is of rather [poor quality][25] such that we do not see new developers joining the CGLIB project. For an impression of CGLIB&#39;s activeness, see their [mailing list][26].\r\n\r\nNote that following a [proposition on the guice mailing list][27], CGLIB is now available on [github][24] to enable the community to better help the project, it appears to be working (multiple commits and pull requests, ci, updated maven), yet most concerns still remain.\r\n\r\nAt this time there are working on version 3.2.0, and they are focusing effort on Java 8, but so far users that want that java 8 support have to use tricks at build time. But progress is very slow.\r\n\r\nAnd CGLIB is still known to be plagued for PermGen memory leak. But other projects may not have been battle tested for so many years.\r\n\r\n[Compile time annotation Processing][28] [tag:annotation-processing]\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n_This one is not runtime of course, but is an important part of the ecosystem, and most code generation usage don&#39;t need runtime creation._\r\n\r\nThis started with Java 5 that came with the separate command line tool to process annotations : `apt`, and starting from Java 6 annotation processing is integrated into the Java compiler.\r\n\r\nAt some time you were required to explicitly pass the processor, now with the `ServiceLoader` approach  (just add this file `META-INF/services/javax.annotation.processing.Processor` to the jar)  the compiler can detect automatically the annotation processor.\r\n\r\nThis approach at code generation has drawbacks too it require a lot of work and understanding of the Java language not bytecode. This API is a bit cumbersome, and as one is plugin in the compiler one must take extreme care to make this code the most resilient and user friendly error message.\r\n\r\nThe biggest advantage here is that it avoids another dependency at runtime, you may avoid permgen memory leak. And one has full control on the generated code.\r\n\r\nNote that annotation processing in JDK 22 will need to be explicit (`-processor`, `--processor-path`, `--processor-module-path`, `-proc:only`, `-proc:full`) on the `javac` command line ([JDK-8306819][29]).\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n----------\r\nIn [2002][30] CGLIB defined a new standard to manipulate bytecode with ease. Many tools and methodology we have nowadays (CI, coverage, TDD, etc.) were not available or not mature at that time.

But mastering ASM is most certainly very interesting. Note however that while there is a <strong>great</strong> <a href=\"https://asm.ow2.io/asm4-guide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ASM 4 guide</a>, in some part of the API the javadoc documentation can be very concise if it is present at all, but it is being improved. It closely follows JVM versions to support new features, however it has a downside is cannot handle well byte codes from the next JDK release and as such may require to wait for a release supporting those.</p>\n<p>However, if you need full control, ASM is your weapon of choice.</p>\n<p>This project sees regular updates ; at the time of this edit version 9.6 was released on 30 September 2023, with supports for JDK 22 opcodes.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://bytebuddy.net\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Byte Buddy</a> <a href=\"/questions/tagged/byte-buddy\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;byte-buddy&#39;\" aria-label=\"show questions tagged &#39;byte-buddy&#39;\" rel=\"tag\" aria-labelledby=\"tag-byte-buddy-tooltip-container\">byte-buddy</a></h2>\n<p>Byte Buddy is a rather new library but provides any functionality that CGLIB or Javassist provides and much more.

Also with multiple examples and a big tutorial this is not a real issue.</p>\n<p>In October 2015 this projects received the <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/dukes-award-102815.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Oracle Duke's choice award</a>. The latest release at the time of this edit is <a href=\"https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy/blob/master/release-notes.md\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1.14.9</a>, and ships with ASM 9.6 with preliminary JDK 22 support.</p>\n<p>Note that <a href=\"/questions/tagged/mockito\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;mockito&#39;\" aria-label=\"show questions tagged &#39;mockito&#39;\" rel=\"tag\" aria-labelledby=\"tag-mockito-tooltip-container\">mockito</a> has replaced <a href=\"https://github.com/mockito/mockito/pull/171\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CGLIB by Byte Buddy</a> in version 2.1.0.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/457\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The JDK's classfile API (JEP-456)</a></h2>\n<p>The authors of the JDK have been working on an API within the JDK, the JEP mentions the <a href=\"https://cr.openjdk.org/%7Easotona/JDK-8308753-preview/api/java.base/java/lang/classfile/package-summary.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">java.lang.classfile</a> package.</p>\n<p>The goal is to provide an API based on today's challenge for the JDK, as classfile is evolving faster than in 2002 when ASM was designed. THE JDK authors wanted to start from a fresh perspective when they created this API, instead of taking ownership of the old ASM codebase (A significant difference might be that ASM does very few allocations, while Classfile API might do a lot more, but the tradeoff are gained elsewhere (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcg-E_qyMOI\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>).).</p>\n<p>At the time of this edit the Classfile API JEP is not yet targeted for JDK 22, but is likely to land on the JDK at some point, in preview at first.</p>\n<p>This API is an alternative to ASM, and may support additional features, but it won;t offer the higher level features that ByteBuddy provides, and certainly won't help for Android developers.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://jboss-javassist.github.io/javassist/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Javassist</a> <a href=\"/questions/tagged/javassist\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;javassist&#39;\" aria-label=\"show questions tagged &#39;javassist&#39;\" rel=\"tag\" aria-labelledby=\"tag-javassist-tooltip-container\">javassist</a></h2>\n<p>The javadoc of Javassist is way better than that of CGLIB. The class engineering API is OK, but Javassist is not perfect either. In particular, the <code>ProxyFactory</code> which is the equivalent of the CGLIB's <code>Enhancer</code> suffer from some drawbacks too, just to list a few :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bridge method are not fully supported (ie the one that are generated for covariant return types)</li>\n<li><code>ClassloaderProvider</code> is a static field instead, then it applies to all instances within the same classloader</li>\n<li>Custom naming could have been welcome (with checks for signed jars)</li>\n<li>There is no extension point and almost all methods of interest are private, which is cumbersome if we want to change some behavior</li>\n<li>While Javassist offer support for annotation attributes in classes, they are not supported in <code>ProxyFactory</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the aspect oriented side, one can inject code in a proxy, but this approach in Javassist is limited and a bit error-prone :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>aspect code is written in a plain Java String that is <em>compiled</em> in opcodes</li>\n<li>no type check</li>\n<li>no generics</li>\n<li>no lambda</li>\n<li>no auto-(un)boxing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also Javassist is recognized to be slower than Cglib. This is mainly due to its approach of reading class files instead of reading loaded classes such as CGLIB does. And the <a href=\"https://github.com/jboss-javassist/javassist/blob/master/src/main/javassist/util/proxy/ProxyFactory.java\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">implementation</a> itself is hard to read to be fair ; if one requires to make changes in the Javassist code there's many chances to break something.</p>\n<p>Javassist suffered from inactivity as well, their move to <a href=\"https://github.com/jboss-javassist/javassist/commit/651ccca561b933660a0a26139daa6e42911f866d\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">github circa 2013</a> seem to have proven useful as it shows regular commits and pull requests from the community.</p>\n<p>These limitations still stand in the version 3.17.1. Version has been bumped to version 3.20.0, yet it seems Javassist may still have issues with Java 8 support.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/qmx/jitescript\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JiteScript</a></h2>\n<p>JiteScript does seem like a new piece of nicely shaping up DSL for ASM, this is based on the latest ASM release (4.0). The code looks clean.</p>\n<p><strong>But</strong> the project is still in his early age so API / behavior can change, plus the documentation is dire. And updates scarce if not abandoned.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://jodd.org/doc/proxetta/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Proxetta</a> <a href=\"/questions/tagged/jodd\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;jodd&#39;\" aria-label=\"show questions tagged &#39;jodd&#39;\" rel=\"tag\" aria-labelledby=\"tag-jodd-tooltip-container\">jodd</a></h2>\n<p>This is a rather new tool but it offers the by far best <em>human</em> API. It allows for different types of proxies such as subclass proxies (cglib approach) or weaving or delegation.</p>\n<p>Although, this one is rather rare, no information exists if it works well. There are so many corner case to deal with when dealing with bytecode.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://eclipse.org/aspectj/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AspectJ</a> <a href=\"/questions/tagged/aspectj\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;aspectj&#39;\" aria-label=\"show questions tagged &#39;aspectj&#39;\" rel=\"tag\" aria-labelledby=\"tag-aspectj-tooltip-container\">aspectj</a></h2>\n<p>AspectJ is a very powerful tool for <strong>aspect-oriented programming</strong> (only). AspectJ manipulates byte code to achieve its goals such that you might be able to achieve your goals with it. However, this requires manipulation at compile-time; spring offer weaving at load time via an agent since version <a href=\"http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/aop.html#aop-aj-ltw\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2.5</a>, <a href=\"http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.1.x/spring-framework-reference/html/aop.html#aop-aj-ltw\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4.1.x</a>.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/cglib/cglib\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CGLIB</a> <a href=\"/questions/tagged/cglib\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;cglib&#39;\" aria-label=\"show questions tagged &#39;cglib&#39;\" rel=\"tag\" aria-labelledby=\"tag-cglib-tooltip-container\">cglib</a></h2>\n<p><em>A word about CGLIB that has been updated since that question has been asked.</em></p>\n<p>CGLIB is quite fast, it is one of the main reason why it is still around, along with the fact that CGLIB worked almost better than any alternatives until now (2014-2015).</p>\n<p>Generally speaking libraries that allow the rewriting of classes at run time have to avoid loading any types before the corresponding class is rewritten. Therefore, they cannot make use of the Java reflection API which requires that any type used in reflection is loaded. Instead, they have to read the class files via IO (which is a performance-breaker). This makes for example Javassist or Proxetta significantly slower than Cglib which simply reads the methods via the reflection API and overrides them.</p>\n<p><s>However, CGLIB is no longer under active development. There were recent releases but those changes were seen as insignificant by many and most people did never update to version 3 since CGLIB introduced some <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/p/cglib/bugs/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">severe bugs</a> in the last releases what did not really build up confidence.</s> Version 3.1 fixed a lot of the woes of version 3.0 (since version 4.0.3 Spring framework repackages <a href=\"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/build.gradle#L282\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">version 3.1</a>).</p>\n<p>Also, the CGLIB source code is of rather <a href=\"http://www.docjar.com/html/api/net/sf/cglib/proxy/Enhancer.java.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">poor quality</a> such that we do not see new developers joining the CGLIB project. For an impression of CGLIB's activeness, see their <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/p/cglib/mailman/cglib-devel/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mailing list</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that following a <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/google-guice/J8QCB3HNSEY/2YYB9ooRNTQJ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">proposition on the guice mailing list</a>, CGLIB is now available on <a href=\"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/build.gradle#L282\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">github</a> to enable the community to better help the project, it appears to be working (multiple commits and pull requests, ci, updated maven), yet most concerns still remain.</p>\n<p>At this time there are working on version 3.2.0, and they are focusing effort on Java 8, but so far users that want that java 8 support have to use tricks at build time. But progress is very slow.</p>\n<p>And CGLIB is still known to be plagued for PermGen memory leak. But other projects may not have been battle tested for so many years.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/annotation/processing/Processor.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Compile time annotation Processing</a> <a href=\"/questions/tagged/annotation-processing\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;annotation-processing&#39;\" aria-label=\"show questions tagged &#39;annotation-processing&#39;\" rel=\"tag\" aria-labelledby=\"tag-annotation-processing-tooltip-container\">annotation-processing</a></h2>\n<p><em>This one is not runtime of course, but is an important part of the ecosystem, and most code generation usage don't need runtime creation.</em></p>\n<p>This started with Java 5 that came with the separate command line tool to process annotations : <code>apt</code>, and starting from Java 6 annotation processing is integrated into the Java compiler.</p>\n<p>At some time you were required to explicitly pass the processor, now with the <code>ServiceLoader</code> approach  (just add this file <code>META-INF/services/javax.annotation.processing.Processor</code> to the jar)  the compiler can detect automatically the annotation processor.</p>\n<p>This approach at code generation has drawbacks too it require a lot of work and understanding of the Java language not bytecode. This API is a bit cumbersome, and as one is plugin in the compiler one must take extreme care to make this code the most resilient and user friendly error message.</p>\n<p>The biggest advantage here is that it avoids another dependency at runtime, you may avoid permgen memory leak. And one has full control on the generated code.</p>\n<p>Note that annotation processing in JDK 22 will need to be explicit (<code>-processor</code>, <code>--processor-path</code>, <code>--processor-module-path</code>, <code>-proc:only</code>, <code>-proc:full</code>) on the <code>javac</code> command line (<a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8306819\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JDK-8306819</a>).</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/cglib/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2002</a> CGLIB defined a new standard to manipulate bytecode with ease.

Define &#39;uncaught exception&#39;.\r\n\r\n## Technical\r\n\r\nTechnically there&#39;s no such thing. Exceptions are always caught by something, eventually. They bubble up the stack, ending methods immediately, recursively applying that principle (end this method right now, going back to the method one up the stack. End that one right now, go back to the method one further up. Endlessly. Or until we hit a catch block, which __you always will__).\r\n\r\nThread itself will catch it if it has to. It then invokes the uncaught exception handler with it. You can configure it using `Thread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler`. There&#39;s no need to use agents to call that method.\r\n\r\nHowever, inject something as simple as, say, an appserver or web server, and usually their &#39;endpoint runner&#39; (the thing in the framework that invokes your code) will catch it all.\r\n\r\nSo, how do you define &#39;uncaught&#39;? Does an exception that bubbles up to the webserver endpoint runner count as &#39;uncaught&#39;?\r\n\r\nIf you say &#39;yes, that is uncaught&#39;, you have a few problems:\r\n\r\n1. You need specific knowledge and modify the webframework to figure this out. You&#39;d have to write it for every web framework or at least customize your &#39;uncaught exceptions counter&#39; for every appserver-ish thing your stack uses.\r\n\r\n2. This will also count, say, an IOException caused by the sender because they hung up the connection halfway through sending HTTP headers, and ServletExceptions - i.e. things that __are designed to be handled by the webserver endpoint runner__. I assume the point of this &#39;uncaught exceptions counting system&#39; is to find and eliminate such things, but then you have a false positive issue. These exceptions should absolutely not be &#39;handled&#39; - what is currently happening (that they end up at the webserver runner that handles them) is correct.\r\n\r\nIf you say &#39;no, that means they are handled&#39;, then your app is useless, as that means everything is handled. Because those endpoint runners catch Throwable. (and are correct in doing so).\r\n\r\nSo, the technical approach isn&#39;t feasible. Unless you just want to stop stack traces showing up on sysout. Then, just use `Thread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler`. JVMs start with an uncaught exception handler that just prints the exception type, message, trace, and causal chain to `System.err`. You can override it with one that does something else, no problem. Do it as first thing in your `void main()` method. No need to bother with agents.\r\n\r\n## Pragmatically\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to focus on some sort of technical definition, we can talk about what you actually mean by &#39;an unhandled exception&#39;, which is generally: An exception that code ought to be handling, but doesn&#39;t.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, that, as a concept, is completely unbound from anything you can technically measure. For example, take this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic void saveGame() {\r\n  try {\r\n    Files.write(&quot;symersAwesomeGame001.sav&quot;, gameState.asBytes());\r\n  } catch (IOException e) {\r\n    e.printStackTrace();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I take a microphone to a java conference, show them the above code, and ask: &quot;Soo, what do you say? Did the author of this code handle I/O exceptions?&quot;, the vast majority of respondents would give the correct answer. Which is __NO__ - that isn&#39;t appropriate at all.\r\n\r\nIf the aim is to find places where exception handling isn&#39;t proper, this is exactly the kind of thing you want to find. But it&#39;s the opposite of the technical definition: The exception __is__ being caught. But that&#39;s the problem: It&#39;s caught but not handled properly. The right move here is likely to make the `saveGame()` method declared as `throws IOException`, or possibly `throws SaveException`). Failing that, the catch block should read `throw new RuntimeException(&quot;unhandled&quot;, e);`.\r\n\r\nTrying to write an agent to catch this stuff is somewhat possible, if you posit that &#39;a catch block that just prints stack trace is just wrong, period&#39;. You can scan for that by parsing through class defs (scan the bytecode: Toss it through ASM or bytebuddy or some other bytecode introspection tool).\r\n\r\nHowever, this job is far better suited to source-code-level linting. A linter rule should be set up to disallow catch blocks that just `e.printStackTrace()`. An advantage of this is that you can set up some comment that opts out of the linter - for the very few cases what `e.printStackTrace();` is a well thought out correct answer (it _very rarely_ is, but situations exist, rare as they are, that it&#39;s right to do that).\r\n\r\n","title":"collect metrics for uncaught exceptions in Java","body":"<p>Not really possible.</p>\n<p>The problem is in the definition.

(This can happen when you copy past from somewhere ) Example:<br>\nthe value for spring.cloud.config.uri=http:localhost:&lt; port ><strong><em>&lt; additional empty space ></em></strong></p>\n\n<p>If this is the case, the client's log shows localhost:/<em>20%20%/</em> &lt; app name > / &lt; profile > </p>\n\n<p>Simply remove the post empty space. Then it should work !</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3795830,"reputation":6437,"user_id":3150948,"accept_rate":70,"display_name":"Amer Qarabsa"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1531347286,"creation_date":1531347286,"answer_id":51294894,"question_id":44014594,"body_markdown":"I ran into similar issue, when I run my server locally I see in the logs only on the stratup\r\n\r\n    o.s.c.c.c.ConfigServicePropertySourceLocator - Could not locate PropertySource: label not found\r\n\r\nIt turned out this is a problem with the health check for the config server, when health check is triggered to config server an empty environment is used so the application name is empty hence the spring cloud client will try to access {config-server}/application since application is the default application name, see [issue][1] for more info on this.\r\n\r\nTo solve the issue I just disabled the health check for config server\r\n\r\n    health.config.enabled=false\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config/issues/386","title":"Spring boot Could not locate PropertySource: label not found","body":"<p>I ran into similar issue, when I run my server locally I see in the logs only on the stratup</p>\n\n<pre><code>o.s.c.c.c.ConfigServicePropertySourceLocator - Could not locate PropertySource: label not found\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It turned out this is a problem with the health check for the config server, when health check is triggered to config server an empty environment is used so the application name is empty hence the spring cloud client will try to access {config-server}/application since application is the default application name, see <a href=\"https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-config/issues/386\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">issue</a> for more info on this.</p>\n\n<p>To solve the issue I just disabled the health check for config server</p>\n\n<pre><code>health.config.enabled=false\n</code></pre>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":5464222,"reputation":2787,"user_id":4345461,"display_name":"Filip Savic"},"score":0,"creation_date":1581001794,"post_id":57980397,"comment_id":106291007,"body_markdown":"Omg I can&#39;t believe I forgot this...
