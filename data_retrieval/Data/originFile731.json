This can be done using array programming techniques such as illustrated in my [answer to this question][1]. Using some clever conditionals similar to that used in [Flown&#39;s answer to this question][2] takes care of the edge cases in a neat way.\r\n\r\nThe key insight is to realize that a new segment (or group) begins at every point where the desired predicate is **not** met. That is, a new segment begins is where `seq[i-1] + 1 != seq[i]`. Let&#39;s run an `IntStream` over the input and filter the indexes for this property and store the result in some array `x`:\r\n\r\n        int[] seq = { 1, 2, 3, -1, -1, 1, 2, 1, 2 };\r\n        int[] x = IntStream.range(1, seq.length)\r\n                           .filter(i -&gt; seq[i-1] + 1 != seq[i])\r\n                           .toArray();\r\n\r\nresulting in\r\n\r\n        [3, 4, 5, 7]\r\n\r\nThis only gives us the **interior** boundaries of the segments. To get the starts and ends of the segments, we need to tack on the start of the first segment and the end of the last segment. We adjust the index range and add some conditionals to the filter:\r\n\r\n        int[] x = IntStream.rangeClosed(0, seq.length)\r\n                           .filter(i -&gt; i == 0 || i == seq.length ||\r\n                                        seq[i-1] + 1 != seq[i])\r\n                           .toArray();\r\n\r\n        [0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9]\r\n\r\nNow every adjacent pair of indexes is a subrange of the original array. We can use another stream to extract those subranges, giving the desired result:\r\n\r\n        int[][] result =\r\n            IntStream.range(0, x.length - 1)\r\n                     .mapToObj(i -&gt; Arrays.copyOfRange(seq, x[i], x[i+1]))\r\n                     .toArray(int[][]::new);\r\n\r\n        [[1, 2, 3], [-1], [-1], [1, 2], [1, 2]]\r\n\r\nThis can be extracted into a function that itself takes a &quot;next&quot; function that computes the next value in the segment. That is, for any element, if the element to its right matches the result of the next-function, the elements are in the same segment; otherwise it&#39;s a segment boundary. Here&#39;s the code:\r\n\r\n    int[][] segments(int[] seq, IntUnaryOperator next) {\r\n        int[] x = IntStream.rangeClosed(0, seq.length)\r\n                           .filter(i -&gt; i == 0 || i == seq.length ||\r\n                                   next.applyAsInt(seq[i-1]) != seq[i])\r\n                           .toArray();\r\n        \r\n        return  IntStream.range(0, x.length - 1)\r\n                         .mapToObj(i -&gt; Arrays.copyOfRange(seq, x[i], x[i+1]))\r\n                         .toArray(int[][]::new);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou&#39;d call it like this:\r\n\r\n        int[] seq = { 1, 2, 3, -1, -1, 1, 2, 1, 2 };\r\n        System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(segments(seq, i -&gt; i + 1)));\r\n\r\n        [[1, 2, 3], [-1], [-1], [1, 2], [1, 2]]\r\n\r\nChanging the next-function allows splitting the segments in a different way. For example, to split an array into segments of equal values, you&#39;d do this:\r\n\r\n        int[] seq = { 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4 };\r\n        System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(segments(seq, i -&gt; i)));\r\n\r\n        [[2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [1, 1, 1], [4, 4, 4]]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with using a next-function like this is that the condition for values belonging to a segment is limited. It would be nicer provide a predicate that compares to adjacent values to test if they&#39;re in the same segment. We can do that using a `BiPredicate&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;` if we&#39;re willing to pay the cost of boxing:\r\n\r\n    int[][] segments(int[] input, BiPredicate&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; pred) {\r\n        int[] x = IntStream.rangeClosed(0, input.length)\r\n                           .filter(i -&gt; i == 0 || i == input.length ||\r\n                                   !pred.test(input[i-1], input[i]))\r\n                           .toArray();\r\n        \r\n        return  IntStream.range(0, x.length - 1)\r\n                         .mapToObj(i -&gt; Arrays.copyOfRange(input, x[i], x[i+1]))\r\n                         .toArray(int[][]::new);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis allows gathering segments using a different criterion, for example, monotonically increasing segments:\r\n\r\n        int[] seq = { 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3 };\r\n        System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(segments(seq, (a, b) -&gt; b &gt; a)));\r\n\r\n        [[3], [1, 4], [1, 5, 9], [2, 6], [5], [3]]\r\n\r\nThis could be specialized to use a primitive bi-predicate over two `int` values, or it could be generalized to allow using a `BiPredicate` of any type over input of any type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/29111023/1441122\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/35233967/1441122","title":"Group sequences of values","body":"<p>If you're willing to operate on an in-memory data structure, such as an array or list, it's possible to do this in standard Java 8 in just a couple steps. This can be done using array programming techniques such as illustrated in my <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/29111023/1441122\">answer to this question</a>. Using some clever conditionals similar to that used in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/35233967/1441122\">Flown's answer to this question</a> takes care of the edge cases in a neat way.</p>\n\n<p>The key insight is to realize that a new segment (or group) begins at every point where the desired predicate is <strong>not</strong> met. That is, a new segment begins is where <code>seq[i-1] + 1 != seq[i]</code>. Let's run an <code>IntStream</code> over the input and filter the indexes for this property and store the result in some array <code>x</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    int[] seq = { 1, 2, 3, -1, -1, 1, 2, 1, 2 };\n    int[] x = IntStream.range(1, seq.length)\n                       .filter(i -&gt; seq[i-1] + 1 != seq[i])\n                       .toArray();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>resulting in</p>\n\n<pre><code>    [3, 4, 5, 7]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This only gives us the <strong>interior</strong> boundaries of the segments. To get the starts and ends of the segments, we need to tack on the start of the first segment and the end of the last segment. We adjust the index range and add some conditionals to the filter:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    int[] x = IntStream.rangeClosed(0, seq.length)\n                       .filter(i -&gt; i == 0 || i == seq.length ||\n                                    seq[i-1] + 1 != seq[i])\n                       .toArray();\n\n    [0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now every adjacent pair of indexes is a subrange of the original array. We can use another stream to extract those subranges, giving the desired result:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    int[][] result =\n        IntStream.range(0, x.length - 1)\n                 .mapToObj(i -&gt; Arrays.copyOfRange(seq, x[i], x[i+1]))\n                 .toArray(int[][]::new);\n\n    [[1, 2, 3], [-1], [-1], [1, 2], [1, 2]]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This can be extracted into a function that itself takes a \"next\" function that computes the next value in the segment. That is, for any element, if the element to its right matches the result of the next-function, the elements are in the same segment; otherwise it's a segment boundary. Here's the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int[][] segments(int[] seq, IntUnaryOperator next) {\n    int[] x = IntStream.rangeClosed(0, seq.length)\n                       .filter(i -&gt; i == 0 || i == seq.length ||\n                               next.applyAsInt(seq[i-1]) != seq[i])\n                       .toArray();\n\n    return  IntStream.range(0, x.length - 1)\n                     .mapToObj(i -&gt; Arrays.copyOfRange(seq, x[i], x[i+1]))\n                     .toArray(int[][]::new);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You'd call it like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    int[] seq = { 1, 2, 3, -1, -1, 1, 2, 1, 2 };\n    System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(segments(seq, i -&gt; i + 1)));\n\n    [[1, 2, 3], [-1], [-1], [1, 2], [1, 2]]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Changing the next-function allows splitting the segments in a different way. For example, to split an array into segments of equal values, you'd do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    int[] seq = { 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4 };\n    System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(segments(seq, i -&gt; i)));\n\n    [[2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [1, 1, 1], [4, 4, 4]]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The difficulty with using a next-function like this is that the condition for values belonging to a segment is limited. It would be nicer provide a predicate that compares to adjacent values to test if they're in the same segment. We can do that using a <code>BiPredicate&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;</code> if we're willing to pay the cost of boxing:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int[][] segments(int[] input, BiPredicate&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; pred) {\n    int[] x = IntStream.rangeClosed(0, input.length)\n                       .filter(i -&gt; i == 0 || i == input.length ||\n                               !pred.test(input[i-1], input[i]))\n                       .toArray();\n\n    return  IntStream.range(0, x.length - 1)\n                     .mapToObj(i -&gt; Arrays.copyOfRange(input, x[i], x[i+1]))\n                     .toArray(int[][]::new);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This allows gathering segments using a different criterion, for example, monotonically increasing segments:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    int[] seq = { 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3 };\n    System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(segments(seq, (a, b) -&gt; b &gt; a)));\n\n    [[3], [1, 4], [1, 5, 9], [2, 6], [5], [3]]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This could be specialized to use a primitive bi-predicate over two <code>int</code> values, or it could be generalized to allow using a <code>BiPredicate</code> of any type over input of any type.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1642242,"reputation":1062,"user_id":1514467,"accept_rate":83,"display_name":"rednoah"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":2486,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":10,"accepted_answer_id":35234265,"answer_count":3,"score":10,"last_activity_date":1673633550,"creation_date":1454708944,"question_id":35234128,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s in any nifty way to use the new Stream APIs to &quot;group&quot; sequences of values. \r\n\r\ne.g. split a series of integers, into groups of integers where each group is an ascending number sequence:\r\n\r\n    IntStream seq = IntStream.of(1, 2, 3, -1, -1, 1, 2, 1, 2);\r\n    IntFunction next = i -&gt; i + 1;\r\n\r\n    // DESIRED OUTPUT: [[1,2,3], [-1], [-1], [1,2], [1,2]]\r\n","title":"Group sequences of values","body":"<p>I'm wondering if there's in any nifty way to use the new Stream APIs to \"group\" sequences of values. </p>\n\n<p>e.g. split a series of integers, into groups of integers where each group is an ascending number sequence:</p>\n\n<pre><code>IntStream seq = IntStream.of(1, 2, 3, -1, -1, 1, 2, 1, 2);\nIntFunction next = i -&gt; i + 1;\n\n// DESIRED OUTPUT: [[1,2,3], [-1], [-1], [1,2], [1,2]]\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":6488524,"reputation":879,"user_id":5023303,"accept_rate":40,"display_name":"ivoronline"},"score":0,"creation_date":1673635866,"post_id":75112895,"comment_id":132551512,"body_markdown":"Thank you very much.

See: http://polymathprogrammer.com/2009/10/22/english-metric-units-and-open-xml/ and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML_file_formats#DrawingML\r\n\r\n&gt; A DrawingML graphic&#39;s dimensions are specified in English Metric Units\r\n&gt; (EMUs). It is so called because it allows an exact common\r\n&gt; representation of dimensions originally in either English or Metric\r\n&gt; units—defined as 1/360,000 of a centimeter, and thus there are 914,400\r\n&gt; EMUs per inch, and 12,700 EMUs per point, to prevent round-off in\r\n&gt; calculations.\r\n\r\nSo your added picture is **very** small. It is not even a pixel (or a point) width and high. So it is not visible.\r\n\r\nAs documented in [XWPFRun.addPicture](https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/dev/org/apache/poi/xwpf/usermodel/XWPFRun.html#addPicture-java.io.InputStream-int-java.lang.String-int-int-&lt;):\r\n\r\n&gt; public XWPFPicture addPicture...\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Adds a picture to the run. This method handles attaching the picture\r\n&gt; data to the overall file. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Parameters: ... \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; width - width in EMUs. To\r\n&gt; convert to / from points use\r\n&gt; [Units](https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/dev/org/apache/poi/util/Units.html)\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; height - height in EMUs. To convert to / from points use\r\n&gt; [Units](https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/dev/org/apache/poi/util/Units.html)\r\n\r\nSo try using:\r\n\r\n    imageRun.addPicture(new FileInputStream(imgFile), XWPFDocument.PICTURE_TYPE_PNG, imgFile, Units.pixelToEMU(200), Units.pixelToEMU(200));\r\n\r\nif the 200 means pixel.\r\n\r\nOr \r\n\r\n    imageRun.addPicture(new FileInputStream(imgFile), XWPFDocument.PICTURE_TYPE_PNG, imgFile, Units.toEMU(200), Units.toEMU(200));\r\n\r\nif the 200 means points.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________\r\n\r\nThe above is one problem. But seeing your code I doubt it is the only one. \r\n\r\nThe code line `for (XWPFRun run : runs) {` should throw `java.util.ConcurrentModificationException` when the code in `if (text != null &amp;&amp; text.contains(&quot;word&quot;)) {...}` gets reached. `XWPFRun run : runs` internally uses an `Iterator` which gets damaged if `paragraph.insertNewRun` inserts a new XWPFRun in `paragraph`.  So if there is no error, then `text.contains(&quot;word&quot;)` never gets true. Try debugging:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n                    String text = run.getText(0);\r\n                    System.out.println(text);\r\n                    if (text != null &amp;&amp; text.contains(&quot;word&quot;)) {\r\n                        System.out.println(text + &quot; contains word&quot;);\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nIs there a run which contains &quot;word&quot;?\r\n\r\nTo avoid the `java.util.ConcurrentModificationException` do using:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n                //for (XWPFRun run : runs) {\r\n                for (int r = 0; r &lt; runs.size(); r++) {\r\n                    XWPFRun run = runs.get(r);\r\n                    // Check if the run contains the word we want to insert the image after\r\n                    String text = run.getText(0);\r\n                    System.out.println(text);\r\n                    if (text != null &amp;&amp; text.contains(&quot;word&quot;)) {\r\n                        System.out.println(text + &quot; contains word&quot;);\r\n                        // Create a new run for the image\r\n                        XWPFRun imageRun = paragraph.insertNewRun(runs.indexOf(run) + 1);\r\n     \r\n                        // Add the image to the run\r\n                        String imgFile = images[imageCounter].getAbsolutePath();\r\n                        //imageRun.addPicture(new FileInputStream(imgFile), XWPFDocument.PICTURE_TYPE_PNG, imgFile, 200, 200);\r\n                        imageRun.addPicture(new FileInputStream(imgFile), XWPFDocument.PICTURE_TYPE_PNG, imgFile, Units.pixelToEMU(200), Units.pixelToEMU(200));\r\n                        imageCounter++;\r\n                        if (imageCounter &gt;= images.length) {\r\n                            imageCounter = 0;\r\n                        }\r\n                        // Add a line break after the image\r\n                        imageRun.addBreak();\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n________________________________________________\r\n\r\nIf `(text != null &amp;&amp; text.contains(&quot;word&quot;))` never gets true, then it might be that no stored text run in the Word document fully contains the text &quot;word&quot;. Word is very special in splitting text in text runs. Not only formatting leads to split text runs. Also spell checker splits text in different text runs to mark errors. And sometimes Word is just crazy in how it splits text in text runs. So it can be that the text &quot;word&quot; is stored so: `&lt;r&gt;w&lt;/r&lt;r&gt;ord&lt;/r&gt;`.\r\n\r\nTo overcome those issues, [TextSegment](https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/dev/org/apache/poi/xwpf/usermodel/TextSegment.html) was introduced in Apache POI.

If you are using a different OS, your experience may be different.\r\n - I am using NetBeans 16 (currently the most recent release).\r\n - My tests were all with Eclipse Adoptium releases of Java (17, 18 and 19).\r\n - I am specifically targeting the NetBeans output window (not a command line or terminal).\r\n - My NetBeans output window is using the Monospaced 12 font (see NetBeans Options &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Output). There&#39;s no point in using a font which may not support the Unicode characters you want to print - so don&#39;t forget to check that setting.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## For Java 17\r\n\r\nDouble-check that Java 17 is actually being used in Project properties &gt; Build &gt; Compile &gt; Java platform.\r\n\r\nYou need both of these:\r\n\r\n - netbeans.conf (see below): `-J-Dsun.stdout.encoding=UTF-8`\r\n - Project properties &gt; Run &gt; VM Options: `-Dsun.stdout.encoding=UTF-8`\r\n\r\nAnd, optionally, if you are using Maven, you should set these Maven options:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;maven.compiler.source&gt;17&lt;/maven.compiler.source&gt;\r\n&lt;maven.compiler.target&gt;17&lt;/maven.compiler.target&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the answer I linked to above, except that instead of using:\r\n\r\n    file.encoding=UTF-8\r\n\r\nyou are now using:\r\n\r\n    sun.stdout.encoding=UTF-8\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## For Java 18\r\n\r\nThis is the same as Java 17, but with the Java platform (and, if relevant, Maven settings) changed accordingly, of course.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## For Java 19\r\n\r\nInstead of using this:\r\n\r\n    sun.stdout.encoding=UTF-8\r\n\r\nUse this:\r\n\r\n    stdout.encoding=UTF-8\r\n\r\nSo, specifically, that means:\r\n\r\n - netbeans.conf (see below): `-J-Dstdout.encoding=UTF-8`\r\n - Project properties &gt; Run &gt; VM Options: `-Dstdout.encoding=UTF-8`\r\n\r\n(And change your Maven settings if relevant.)\r\n\r\n&lt;sub&gt;I think `sun.stdout.encoding=UTF-8` still works but I expect `stdout.encoding=UTF-8` is more appropriate, since `sun` settings should generally be avoided (internal use only). I don&#39;t know if they work the same way, under the covers. According to the [UTF-8 by Default JEP](https://openjdk.org/jeps/400), `sun.stdout.encoding` is &quot;_unspecified and unsupported_&quot;.&lt;/sub&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;sub&gt;I could not find any official documentation for the newer `stdout.encoding`, except for a reference to it [in this OpenJDK ticket](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8293957).

If you are using a different OS, your experience may be different.</li>\n<li>I am using NetBeans 16 (currently the most recent release).</li>\n<li>My tests were all with Eclipse Adoptium releases of Java (17, 18 and 19).</li>\n<li>I am specifically targeting the NetBeans output window (not a command line or terminal).</li>\n<li>My NetBeans output window is using the Monospaced 12 font (see NetBeans Options &gt; Miscellaneous &gt; Output). There's no point in using a font which may not support the Unicode characters you want to print - so don't forget to check that setting.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>For Java 17</h2>\n<p>Double-check that Java 17 is actually being used in Project properties &gt; Build &gt; Compile &gt; Java platform.</p>\n<p>You need both of these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>netbeans.conf (see below): <code>-J-Dsun.stdout.encoding=UTF-8</code></li>\n<li>Project properties &gt; Run &gt; VM Options: <code>-Dsun.stdout.encoding=UTF-8</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And, optionally, if you are using Maven, you should set these Maven options:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;maven.compiler.source&gt;17&lt;/maven.compiler.source&gt;\n&lt;maven.compiler.target&gt;17&lt;/maven.compiler.target&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is similar to the answer I linked to above, except that instead of using:</p>\n<pre><code>file.encoding=UTF-8\n</code></pre>\n<p>you are now using:</p>\n<pre><code>sun.stdout.encoding=UTF-8\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<h2>For Java 18</h2>\n<p>This is the same as Java 17, but with the Java platform (and, if relevant, Maven settings) changed accordingly, of course.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>For Java 19</h2>\n<p>Instead of using this:</p>\n<pre><code>sun.stdout.encoding=UTF-8\n</code></pre>\n<p>Use this:</p>\n<pre><code>stdout.encoding=UTF-8\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, specifically, that means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>netbeans.conf (see below): <code>-J-Dstdout.encoding=UTF-8</code></li>\n<li>Project properties &gt; Run &gt; VM Options: <code>-Dstdout.encoding=UTF-8</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>(And change your Maven settings if relevant.)</p>\n<p><sub>I think <code>sun.stdout.encoding=UTF-8</code> still works but I expect <code>stdout.encoding=UTF-8</code> is more appropriate, since <code>sun</code> settings should generally be avoided (internal use only). I don't know if they work the same way, under the covers. According to the <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/400\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">UTF-8 by Default JEP</a>, <code>sun.stdout.encoding</code> is &quot;<em>unspecified and unsupported</em>&quot;.</sub></p>\n<p><sub>I could not find any official documentation for the newer <code>stdout.encoding</code>, except for a reference to it <a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8293957\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in this OpenJDK ticket</a>.

How can i figure out it ?</p>\n<pre><code>    public void onCapturePhoto(String fileName){\n        //Intent to take photos\n\n\n        File storageDirectory = requireActivity().getExternalFilesDir(Environment.DIRECTORY_PICTURES);\n        try {\n            Log.d(&quot;#picName&quot;,fileName);\n            File imageFile = File.createTempFile(fileName,&quot;.jpg&quot;,storageDirectory);\n                currentPhotoPath = imageFile.getAbsolutePath();\n                Uri imageUri= FileProvider.getUriForFile(requireActivity(),&quot;com.ticanalyse.mheath.bf&quot;,imageFile);\n                Intent intent = new Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE);\n                intent.putExtra(MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT,imageUri);\n            startActivityForResult(intent,1);\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n\n  @Override\n    public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n        if (requestCode == 1 &amp;&amp; resultCode == RESULT_OK) {\n\n\n        }\n    }\n\n    \n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":64747,"reputation":4330,"user_id":190986,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"smessing"},"score":0,"creation_date":1332258799,"post_id":9790210,"comment_id":12463984,"body_markdown":"Maybe add some code and sample output?","body":"Maybe add some code and sample output?"},{"owner":{"account_id":440158,"reputation":323231,"user_id":829571,"accept_rate":94,"display_name":"assylias"},"score":0,"creation_date":1332259076,"post_id":9790210,"comment_id":12464109,"body_markdown":"possible duplicate of [How to get the parent base class object super.getClass()](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3294656/how-to-get-the-parent-base-class-object-super-getclass)","body":"possible duplicate of <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3294656/how-to-get-the-parent-base-class-object-super-getclass\">How to get the parent base class object super.getClass()</a>"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":265510,"reputation":8275,"user_id":552521,"accept_rate":78,"display_name":"Abhishek Choudhary"},"score":0,"creation_date":1332259209,"post_id":9790248,"comment_id":12464173,"body_markdown":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3294656/how-to-get-the-parent-base-class-object-super-getclass this thread by you suggested of Bad Design , so what will be your recommendation to avoid it","body":"<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3294656/how-to-get-the-parent-base-class-object-super-getclass\" title=\"how to get the parent base class object super getclass\">stackoverflow.com/questions/3294656/&hellip;</a> this thread by you suggested of Bad Design , so what will be your recommendation to avoid it"},{"owner":{"account_id":70258,"reputation":590444,"user_id":203907,"accept_rate":81,"display_name":"Bozho"},"score":0,"creation_date":1332264195,"post_id":9790248,"comment_id":12466591,"body_markdown":"It depends on the scenario.

For example, you can [wrap a java Executor Service](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/scheduler/Schedulers.html#fromExecutorService-java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService-java.lang.String-)\r\n2. **Wrap** the publisher you want to block with another one, that will publish / schedule its actions on your scheduler:\r\n   ```java\r\n   Scheduler blockingCompatibleScheduler = Schedulers.boundedElastic();\r\n   Mono&lt;T&gt; toBlock = Mono...\r\n   Mono&lt;T&gt; wrapper = Mono.fromCallable(() -&gt; toBlock.block())\r\n                         .subscribeOn(blockingCompatibleScheduler);\r\n   // or\r\n   Mono&lt;T&gt; wrapper = Mono.just(&quot;any&quot;)\r\n                         .publishOn(blockingCompatibleScheduler)\r\n                         .map(it -&gt; toBlock.block());\r\n   ```\r\n   More details available in [dedicated section of the official doc](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#faq.wrap-blocking)\r\n\r\n## Block breaks context\r\n\r\nUntil now, I was refering to the *execution* context. But there is a second kind: the \r\n*state* context.\r\n\r\nSince Reactor 3.1, a [Context](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/util/context/Context.html) / [ContextView](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/util/context/ContextView.html) API is provided to share contextual information across *chained* subscriptions, from downstream to upstream.\r\n\r\nThe official documentation contains an [dedicated section about this mechanism](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#context), to provide in-depth explanation (this is quite complex).\r\n\r\nDue to its nature, `block` operator prevent this mechanism to work. \r\nAs a context propagate information from a downstream subscription to an inner/upstream one, it cannot provide context information to `block` operator: it use a hidden subscription, disconnected from the parent/downstream subscription/pipeline. Said otherwise, a flux/mono cannot access an inner blocked publisher, and therefore cannot propagate context in it.\r\n\r\nWe can test it in a simplified example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport reactor.core.publisher.Mono;\r\n\r\npublic class BlockBreaksContext {\r\n\r\n\tstatic final Object CTX_KEY = new Object();\r\n\r\n\t/**\r\n\t * Add &quot;Hello&quot; message to the provided action context, then run/block it and print\r\n\t * output value.\r\n\t */\r\n\tstatic void execute(Mono&lt;String&gt; action) {\r\n\t\tString value = Mono.from(action)\r\n\t\t\t\t           .contextWrite(ctx -&gt; ctx.put(CTX_KEY, &quot;Hello&quot;))\r\n\t\t\t\t           .block();\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(value);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\t\tMono&lt;String&gt; getContextValue = Mono.deferContextual(ctx\r\n\t\t\t\t-&gt; Mono.just(ctx.getOrDefault(CTX_KEY, &quot;No value from context&quot;)));\r\n\r\n\t\t// Without blocking, the mono will receive the context written by downstream subscription\r\n\t\texecute(getContextValue.map(it -&gt; &quot;NO BLOCKING: &quot; + it));\r\n\r\n\t\t// With blocking, the Mono is **not** part of the &quot;main&quot; pipeline/subscription.\r\n\t\t// Therefore, it cannot receive context on execution, because block cause an\r\n\t\t// independent/isolated subscription, whose main chain of event is unaware of.\r\n\t\tMono wrapBlock = Mono.fromCallable(() -&gt; getContextValue.block());\r\n\t\texecute(wrapBlock.map(it -&gt; &quot;BLOCKING: &quot; + it));\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis program prints:\r\n\r\n```stdout\r\nNO BLOCKING: Hello\r\nBLOCKING: No value from context\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your question, you try to access a security token. As the token is resolved upon client request, Webflux put it in the response publisher context.

These seem like batch tasks that you could send to a C/C++ function for processing.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","google-api","google-oauth","google-people-api"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2066403,"reputation":109440,"user_id":1841839,"accept_rate":71,"display_name":"Linda Lawton - DaImTo"},"score":0,"creation_date":1673619394,"post_id":75110317,"comment_id":132546151,"body_markdown":"Please edit your question and include [Example]","body":"Please edit your question and include <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example\">minimal reproducible example</a>"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2066403,"reputation":109440,"user_id":1841839,"accept_rate":71,"display_name":"Linda Lawton - DaImTo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1673619377,"creation_date":1673619377,"answer_id":75110378,"question_id":75110317,"body_markdown":"If you are already getting the names and email then all you need to do is add occupation and birthday to the personFields property its a coma separated field so the following should do it.\r\n\r\n    names,occupations,birthdays,email\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue will probably be the scopes you are requesting.
