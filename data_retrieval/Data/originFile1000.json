To cache each item individually, I am following the below approach, but it doesn't seem to work.</p>\n<pre><code>public List&lt;Item&gt; getAllItemsOnStartUp() {\n            allItemsList = repo.getAllItems();\n            for (Item item : allItemsList) {\n                staticItem = item;\n                getItem(item.getItmsId());\n            }\n        \n        return allItemsList;\n    }\n\n    @CachePut(value = &quot;allItems&quot;, key = &quot;#itmsId&quot;)\n    public Item getItem(BigInteger itmsId) {\n        return item;\n    }\n\n@Override\n@Cacheable(value = &quot;allItems&quot;)\n    public List&lt;Item&gt; getAllItems() {\n        \n        allItemsList = repo.getAllItems();\n        return allItemsList;\n    }\n\n@Override\n    @Transactional\n    @CachePut(value = &quot;allItems&quot;, key=&quot;#a0.itmsId&quot;)\n    public Item insertItem(Item item) {\n      Item savedItem = rRepo.save(item);\n      return savedItem;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>When the server starts up, <code>getAllItemsOnStartUp()</code> must run and populate cache. the app calls <code>getAllItems()</code> to retrieve the list, it is expected to use cache here but every time the app gets data from DB which takes 3 seconds.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":30171,"reputation":40012,"user_id":82118,"accept_rate":72,"display_name":"Carl Manaster"},"score":2,"creation_date":1272048985,"post_id":2701182,"comment_id":2724027,"body_markdown":"It&#39;s generally a bad idea.

He does not answer questions on SO as far as I know. You can go spelunking in de archives of [the lambda-dev mailing list](https://mail.openjdk.org/mailman/listinfo/lambda-dev) if you want.\r\n\r\nOne could make an informed guess, though.\r\n\r\n# In-scope vs Beyond-scope\r\n\r\nThere are 3 transparancies that lambdas _do not_ have.\r\n\r\n1. Control flow.\r\n2. Checked exceptions.\r\n3. Mutable local variables.\r\n\r\n## Control flow transparency\r\nTake this code, as an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate Map&lt;String, PhoneNumber&gt; phonebook = ...;\r\n\r\npublic PhoneNumber findPhoneNumberOf(String personName) {\r\n  phonebook.entrySet().stream().forEach(entry -&gt; {\r\n    if (entry.getKey().equals(personName)) return entry.getValue();\r\n  });\r\n  return null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code is silly (why not just do a `.get`, or if we must stream through the thing, why not use `.filter` and `.findFirst`, but if you look past that, it doesn&#39;t even work: You __cannot `return` the method from within that lambda__. That `return` statement returns the lambda (and thus is a compiler error, the lambda you pass to `forEach` returns `void`). You can&#39;t `continue` or `break` a loop that is outside the lambda from inside it, either.\r\n\r\nContrast to a for loop that can do it just fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (var entry : phonebook.entrySet()) {\r\n  if (entry.getKey().equals(personName)) return entry.getValue();\r\n}\r\nreturn null;\r\n```\r\n\r\ndoes exactly what you think, and works fine.\r\n\r\n## Checked exception transparency\r\n\r\nThis is the one you are complaining about. This doesn&#39;t compile:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic void printFiles(Path... files) throws IOException {\r\n  Arrays.stream(files).forEach(p -&gt; System.out.println(Files.readString(p)));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fact that the context allows you to throw IOExceptions doesn&#39;t help: The above does not compile, because &#39;can throw IOExceptions&#39; as a status doesn&#39;t &#39;transfer&#39; to the inside of the lambda.\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s a theme here: Rewrite it to a normal for loop and it compiles and works precisely the way you want to. So why, exactly, can&#39;t we make lambdas work the same way?\r\n\r\n## mutable local variables\r\n\r\nThis doesn&#39;t work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nint x = 0;\r\nsomeList.stream().forEach(k -&gt; x++);\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Count: &quot; + x);\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can neither modify local variables declared outside the lambda, nor even read them unless they are (effectively) `final`. Why not?\r\n\r\n## These are all __GOOD__ things.. depending on scope layering\r\n\r\nSo far it seems really stupid that lambdas aren&#39;t transparent in these 3 regards. But it turns into a good thing in a slightly different context. Imagine instead of `.stream().forEach` something a little bit different:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass DoubleNullException extends Exception {} // checked!\r\n\r\npublic class Example {\r\n  private TreeSet&lt;String&gt; words;\r\n\r\n  public Example() throws DoubleNullException {\r\n    int comparisonCount = 0;\r\n    this.words = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;((a, b) -&gt; {\r\n      comparisonCount++;\r\n      if (a == null &amp;&amp; b == null) throw new DoubleNullException();\r\n    });\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Comparisons performed: &quot; + comparisonCount);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```  \r\n\r\nLet&#39;s image the 3 transparencies did work. The above code makes use of two of them (tries to mutate `comparisonCount`, and tries to throw `DoubleNullException` from inside to outside).\r\n\r\n__The above code makes absolutely no sense__. The compiler errors are _very much desired_. That comparator is _not going to run_ until perhaps next week in a completely different thread. It runs whenever you add the second element to the set, which is a field, so who knows who is going to do that and which thread would do it. The constructor has long since ceased running - local vars are &#39;on the stack&#39; and thus the local var _has disappeared_. Nevermind that the printing would always print &#39;comparisons made: 0&#39; here, the statement &#39;comparisonCount++:&#39; would be trying to increment a memory position that no longer holds that variable at all.\r\n\r\nEven if we &#39;fix&#39; this (the compiler realizes that a local is used in a lambda and hoists it onto heap, this is what most other languages do), the code _still_ makes no sense as a concept: That print statement wouldn&#39;t print. Also, that comparator can be called from multiple threads so... do we now allow `volatile` on our local vars? Quite the can of worms! In current java, a local variable cannot possibly suffer from thread concurrency synchronization issues because it is not possible to share the _variable_ (you can share the object the variable points at, not the variable itself) with another thread.\r\n\r\nThe reason you ARE allowed to mess with (effectively) final locals is because you can just make a copy, and that&#39;s what the compiler does for you. Copies are fine - if nobody changes anything.\r\n\r\nThe exception similarly doesn&#39;t work: It&#39;s the code that calls `thatSet.add(someElement)` that would get the `DoubleNullException`. The fact that somebody wrote:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExample ex;\r\ntry {\r\n  ex = new Example();\r\n} catch (DoubleNullException e) {\r\n  throw new WrappedEx(e);\r\n}\r\n\r\nex.add(null);\r\nex.add(null); // BOOM\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe line with the remark (`BOOM`) would throw the DoubleNullEx. It &#39;breaks&#39; the checked exception rules: That line would compile (`set.add` doesn&#39;t throw DNEx), but isn&#39;t in a context where throwing DNEx is allowed. The catch block that is in the above snippet cannot ever run.\r\n\r\nSee how it all falls apart, and nothing makes sense?\r\n\r\nThe key clue is: __What happens to the lambda__? Is it &#39;transported&#39;?\r\n\r\nFor some situations, you hand a lambda straight to a method, and that method has a &#39;use it and lose it&#39; mentality: That method you handed the lambda to will run it 0, 1, or many times, but the key is: It runs it right then and there and once the method you handed the lambda to returns, that lambda is __gone__. The thing you handed the lambda to did _not_ store it in a field or hand it to other code that stores it in a field, nor did that method transport the lambda to another thread.\r\n\r\nIn such cases (the method is use-it-then-lose-it), the transparencies would certainly be handy and wouldn&#39;t &quot;break&quot; anything.\r\n\r\nBut when the method you hand the lambda to _does_ transport it to a field (such as the constructor of `TreeSet` which stores the passed comparator in a field, so that future `.add` calls can call it), the transparencies break down and make no sense.\r\n\r\n__Lambdas in java are for both__ and therefore the lack of transparency (in all 3 regards) __actually makes sense__. It&#39;s just annoying when you have a use-it-then-lose-it situation.\r\n\r\nPOTENTIAL FUTURE JAVA FIX: I&#39;ve championed it before but so far, it fell on mostly deaf ears. Next time I see Brian I might bring it up again. Imagine an annotation or other marker you can stick on the parameter of a method that says: &quot;I shall use it or lose it&quot;. The compiler will then ensure you do not transport it (the only thing the compiler will let you do with that param is call `.invoke()` on it. You can&#39;t call anything else, nor can you assign it or hand it to anything else unless you hand it to a method that also marked that parameter as @UseItOrLoseIt. Then the compiler can make the transparency happen with some tactical wrapping for control flow, and for checked exception flow, just by not complaining (checked exceptions are a figment of `javac`&#39;s imagination. The runtime does not have checked exceptions. Which is why scala, kotlin, and other runs-on-the-JVM languages can do it).\r\n\r\n# Actually THEY CAN!\r\n\r\nAs your question ends with - you can actually write `O get() throws T`. So why do the various functional interfaces, such as `Supplier`, not do this?\r\n\r\nMostly because it&#39;s a pain. I&#39;m honestly not sure why e.g. list&#39;s forEach is _not_ defined as:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic &lt;T extends Throwable&gt; forEach(ThrowingConsumer&lt;? super E, ? super T&gt; consumer) throws T {\r\n  for (E elem : this) consumer.consume(elem);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich would work fine and compile (with `ThrowingConsumer` having the obvious impl). Or even that `Consumer` as we have it is declared with the `&lt;O, T extends Exception&gt;` part.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s a bit of a hassle. The way lambdas &#39;work&#39; is that the compiler has to infer from context what functionalinterface you are implementing which notably includes having to bind all the generics out. Adding exception binding to this mix makes it even harder. IDEs tend to get a little confused if you&#39;re in the middle of writing code in a &#39;throwing lambda&#39; and start red-underlining rather a lot, and auto-complete and the like is no help, because the IDE can&#39;t be useful in that context until it knows.\r\n\r\nLambdas as a system were also designed to backwards compatibly replace any existing usages of the concept, such as swing&#39;s `ActionListener`. Such listeners couldn&#39;t throw either, so having the interfaces in the `java.util.function` package be similar would be more familiar and slightly more java idiomatic, possibly.\r\n\r\nThe `throws T` solution would help but isn&#39;t a panacea. It solves, to an extent, the lack of checked exception transparency, but does nothing to solve either mutable local var transparency or control flow transparency. Perhaps the conclusion is simply: The benefits of doing it are more limited than you think, the costs are higher than you think. The cost/benefit analysis says: Bad idea, so it wasn&#39;t done.\r\n","title":"Why Functional API in java does not handle checked exceptions?","body":"<p>This question can be interpreted as 'why did those who made this decision decide it this way', which is asking: &quot;Please summarize 5 years of serious debate - specifically what Brian Goetz and co thought about it&quot;, which is impossible, unless your name is Brian Goetz.

I'm honestly not sure why e.g. list's forEach is <em>not</em> defined as:</p>\n<pre><code>public &lt;T extends Throwable&gt; forEach(ThrowingConsumer&lt;? super E, ? super T&gt; consumer) throws T {\n  for (E elem : this) consumer.consume(elem);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which would work fine and compile (with <code>ThrowingConsumer</code> having the obvious impl). Or even that <code>Consumer</code> as we have it is declared with the <code>&lt;O, T extends Exception&gt;</code> part.</p>\n<p>It's a bit of a hassle. The way lambdas 'work' is that the compiler has to infer from context what functionalinterface you are implementing which notably includes having to bind all the generics out. Adding exception binding to this mix makes it even harder. IDEs tend to get a little confused if you're in the middle of writing code in a 'throwing lambda' and start red-underlining rather a lot, and auto-complete and the like is no help, because the IDE can't be useful in that context until it knows.</p>\n<p>Lambdas as a system were also designed to backwards compatibly replace any existing usages of the concept, such as swing's <code>ActionListener</code>. Such listeners couldn't throw either, so having the interfaces in the <code>java.util.function</code> package be similar would be more familiar and slightly more java idiomatic, possibly.</p>\n<p>The <code>throws T</code> solution would help but isn't a panacea. It solves, to an extent, the lack of checked exception transparency, but does nothing to solve either mutable local var transparency or control flow transparency. Perhaps the conclusion is simply: The benefits of doing it are more limited than you think, the costs are higher than you think. The cost/benefit analysis says: Bad idea, so it wasn't done.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":6678507,"reputation":334,"user_id":5152432,"display_name":"Marco Carlo Moriggi"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":120,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":73895636,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1664454853,"creation_date":1664452320,"question_id":73895090,"body_markdown":"I saw many times that using the functional API in java is really verbose and error-prone when we have to deal with checked exceptions.\r\n\r\nE.g: it&#39;s really convenient to write (and easier to read) code like \r\n```java\r\nvar obj = Objects.requireNonNullElseGet(something, Other::get);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIndeed, it also avoids to improper multiple invokation of getters, like when you do\r\n\r\n```java\r\nvar obj = something.get() != null ? something.get() : other.get();\r\n//        ^^^^ first ^^^^          ^^^^ second ^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nBUT everything becomes a jungle when you have to deal with checked exceptions, and I saw sometimes this really ugly code style:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ntry {\r\n  Objects.requireNonNullElseGet(obj, () -&gt; {\r\n    try {\r\n      return invokeMethodWhichThrows();\r\n    } catch (Exception e) {\r\n      throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n} catch (RuntimeException r){\r\n  Throwable cause = r.getCause();\r\n  if(cause == null)\r\n    throw r;\r\n  else\r\n    throw cause;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich only intent is to handle checked exceptions like when you write code without lambdas.

In that case, use a regular repository implementation! If you do customize your SimpleJpaRepository to be only compatible with a single entity, you will **not be able** to create **other repositories extending SimpleJpaRepository**!\r\n\r\n# 1. About beans and configuration\r\n\r\nIn Spring, a `Repository` is a type of **bean**. This means that it this class can be automatically instantiated by the Spring framework when you need an instance of it (ever noticed that you never need to do `new MyRepository()`?). This is done through a process called _autowiring_ (the general principle of this is called [_Dependency Injection_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection). You can read more about beans and autowiring in spring [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.x/reference/html/using-boot-spring-beans-and-dependency-injection.html). Other typical types of beans are `@Component`, `@Controller` and `@Service`.\r\n\r\nA `Configuration` class on the other hand is a whole different kind of beast. [Configuration classes](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.x/reference/html/using-boot-configuration-classes.html) are used to provide **logic** about how certain beans are to be created. \r\n&gt; An example could for instance be that you want to configure a bean that holds a database connection, and in order to create that bean you need variables that are read from the environment (Environment Variables). In that example the configuration class would be the one reading out the environment variables and creating the database connection bean through a `@Bean` method. \r\n\r\nIn essence configuration classes are thus used to instantiate beans that either 1) are not able to be instantiated automatically or 2) need special bean configuration.\r\n\r\n# 2. About matching constructors\r\n\r\nSpring needs to be able to instantiate the parent class `SimpleJpaRepository`. Therefore, you should assure that you implement matching constructors.\r\nFurthermore, it is a general best practice to split your repository in a `Repository` and a `RepositoryImpl`. \r\n\r\nSo for the constructor matching, this gives:\r\n\r\n**CustomSimpleRepositoryImpl**\r\n```java\r\n\r\npublic class CustomSimpleRepositoryImpl(&lt;T, ID extends Serializable&gt;\r\n        extends SimpleJpaRepository&lt;T, ID&gt; extends CustomSimpleRepository&lt;T, ID&gt; {\r\n\r\n    private EntityManager em;\r\n    private JpaEntityInformation&lt;T, ?&gt; ei;\r\n\r\n    protected CustomSimpleRepositoryImpl(@NonNull Class&lt;T&gt; entityClass, EntityManager em) {\r\n        super(domainClass, em);\r\n        this.em = em;\r\n        this.ei= JpaEntityInformationSupport.getEntityInformation(entityClass, em);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public CustomSimpleRepositoryImpl(JpaEntityInformation&lt;T, ?&gt; entityInformation, EntityManager entityManager) {\r\n        super(entityInformation, entityManager);\r\n        this.em = entityManager;\r\n        this.ei = entityInformation;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /* Whatever you want to put in your repository */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the split:\r\n**CustomSimpleRepository**\r\n```java\r\n@NoRepositoryBean\r\npublic interface CustomJpaRepository&lt;T, ID extends Serializable&gt; extends JpaRepository&lt;T, ID&gt;  {\r\n    /* Whatever you want to put in your repository */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# 3. Customizing repositories\r\n\r\nNote that in the above example I did not use `@Repository` whatsoever. Instead I used `@NoRepositoryBean`. This is because in my example I implemented a _generic `SimpleJpaRepository` replacement_. This repository is not to be instantiated on its own!\r\n\r\n## 3.1 A plain, custom repository\r\n\r\nIf you rather want to customize a regular `Repository`, please only use an interface `CustomRepository` and an implementation called `CustomRepositoryImpl`.\r\n\r\nExample implementations can be found in 3.2.\r\n\r\n## 3.2 A custom repository extending SimpleJpaRepository\r\n\r\nThis is a difficult one: you cannot implement an interface without providing all of its unimplemented methods. So if you really want a repository where you can have both: \r\n1) JPA methods, e.g. `findById`, `findByFieldContainsText(String text)`...\r\n2) Custom methods, e.g. `findAllCountsGroupByParentId()`, `...`\r\n\r\nIt is not possible by creating one single repository interface or class. Instead, you need to create a custom repository where you offload your &quot;custom methods&quot; (2) and a repository that extends `SimpleJpaRepository` where you define your &quot;JPA methods&quot; (1):\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n**CustomJpaRepository.java**\r\n```java\r\n@Repository\r\npublic interface CustomJpaRepository\r\n        extends JpaRepository&lt;CustomEntity, Long&gt;\r\n        extends CustomRepository {\r\n    /* Your desired JPA methods, e.g. */\r\n    // findByNameContainsText(String text);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**CustomRepository.java**\r\n```java\r\npublic interface CustomRepository {\r\n    /* Your desired custom methods, e.g. */\r\n    // findAllCountsWhereContractFinishedGroupByBusinessUnitId();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**CustomRepositoryImpl.java**\r\n```java\r\n@Repository\r\npublic class CustomRepositoryImpl {\r\n\r\n    protected EntityManager em;\r\n\r\n    CustomRepositoryImpl(final EntityManager em) {\r\n        this.em = em;\r\n    }\r\n \r\n    /* Your desired custom methods, e.g. */\r\n    // public findAllCountsWhereContractFinishedGroupByBusinessUnitId() {\r\n    //    ...\r\n    // }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince your `CustomJpaRepository` extends `JpaRepository`, you can use the JPA methods.\r\nSince it also extends `CustomRepository`, it inherits the custom methods.\r\nResult: you can call both kinds of methods (custom and jpa) combined in `CustomJpaRepository`.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/DILEo.png","title":"SimpleJpaRepository argument compilation error","body":"<p>First of all, You should not put <code>@Repository</code> and <code>@Configuration</code> on the same class.\nSecondly, if you are to extend a <code>SimpleJpaRepository</code>, you need to create matching constructors and call the parent constructors.\nThirdly, I would like to note that customizing a <code>SimpleJpaRepository</code> is <strong>NOT ADVISED FOR A SINGLE ENTITY</strong> (e.g. <code>Contrat</code>). In that case, use a regular repository implementation! If you do customize your SimpleJpaRepository to be only compatible with a single entity, you will <strong>not be able</strong> to create <strong>other repositories extending SimpleJpaRepository</strong>!</p>\n<h1>1. About beans and configuration</h1>\n<p>In Spring, a <code>Repository</code> is a type of <strong>bean</strong>. This means that it this class can be automatically instantiated by the Spring framework when you need an instance of it (ever noticed that you never need to do <code>new MyRepository()</code>?). This is done through a process called <em>autowiring</em> (the general principle of this is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Dependency Injection</em></a>. You can read more about beans and autowiring in spring <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.x/reference/html/using-boot-spring-beans-and-dependency-injection.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. Other typical types of beans are <code>@Component</code>, <code>@Controller</code> and <code>@Service</code>.</p>\n<p>A <code>Configuration</code> class on the other hand is a whole different kind of beast. <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.x/reference/html/using-boot-configuration-classes.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Configuration classes</a> are used to provide <strong>logic</strong> about how certain beans are to be created.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An example could for instance be that you want to configure a bean that holds a database connection, and in order to create that bean you need variables that are read from the environment (Environment Variables). In that example the configuration class would be the one reading out the environment variables and creating the database connection bean through a <code>@Bean</code> method.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In essence configuration classes are thus used to instantiate beans that either 1) are not able to be instantiated automatically or 2) need special bean configuration.</p>\n<h1>2. About matching constructors</h1>\n<p>Spring needs to be able to instantiate the parent class <code>SimpleJpaRepository</code>. Therefore, you should assure that you implement matching constructors.\nFurthermore, it is a general best practice to split your repository in a <code>Repository</code> and a <code>RepositoryImpl</code>.</p>\n<p>So for the constructor matching, this gives:</p>\n<p><strong>CustomSimpleRepositoryImpl</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>\npublic class CustomSimpleRepositoryImpl(&lt;T, ID extends Serializable&gt;\n        extends SimpleJpaRepository&lt;T, ID&gt; extends CustomSimpleRepository&lt;T, ID&gt; {\n\n    private EntityManager em;\n    private JpaEntityInformation&lt;T, ?&gt; ei;\n\n    protected CustomSimpleRepositoryImpl(@NonNull Class&lt;T&gt; entityClass, EntityManager em) {\n        super(domainClass, em);\n        this.em = em;\n        this.ei= JpaEntityInformationSupport.getEntityInformation(entityClass, em);\n    }\n\n    public CustomSimpleRepositoryImpl(JpaEntityInformation&lt;T, ?&gt; entityInformation, EntityManager entityManager) {\n        super(entityInformation, entityManager);\n        this.em = entityManager;\n        this.ei = entityInformation;\n    }\n\n    /* Whatever you want to put in your repository */\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>For the split:\n<strong>CustomSimpleRepository</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@NoRepositoryBean\npublic interface CustomJpaRepository&lt;T, ID extends Serializable&gt; extends JpaRepository&lt;T, ID&gt;  {\n    /* Whatever you want to put in your repository */\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h1>3. Customizing repositories</h1>\n<p>Note that in the above example I did not use <code>@Repository</code> whatsoever. Instead I used <code>@NoRepositoryBean</code>. This is because in my example I implemented a <em>generic <code>SimpleJpaRepository</code> replacement</em>. This repository is not to be instantiated on its own!</p>\n<h2>3.1 A plain, custom repository</h2>\n<p>If you rather want to customize a regular <code>Repository</code>, please only use an interface <code>CustomRepository</code> and an implementation called <code>CustomRepositoryImpl</code>.</p>\n<p>Example implementations can be found in 3.2.</p>\n<h2>3.2 A custom repository extending SimpleJpaRepository</h2>\n<p>This is a difficult one: you cannot implement an interface without providing all of its unimplemented methods.

got the same error    \r\nTried running with JDK-8, but got the error - \r\n`java: warning: source release 11 requires target release 11\r\n  Module egress-healthcheck SDK 1.8 is not compatible with

From the posted signature it can be concluded that this is the UTF-8 charset. This UTF-8 decoding corrupts the signature!  \r\nBinary data like signatures, ciphertexts, hash values, random binary data etc. generally do not contain UTF-8 compliant byte sequences. When decoding with UTF-8, these non-compliant sequences are replaced by the [0xEFBFBD][3] replacement character, which *irreversibly* corrupts the data.
