I have Samsung Grand Premium (2014) which has only an accelerometer, so why I am designing the algorithm.\r\n\r\nThe problem is I need to visualize some results in a graphview. I created 3 classes: Accelerometer, Hub and MainScreen. \r\n\r\nIn the Accelerometer.class, I get the new value of the X,Y,Z in a certain period of time. After that I transmit data to Hub. The method IncomingData() receives data from Accelerometer. Then it has to analyze in the future, but now it just receives. This method also counts Samples. If we have 10 seconds window analysis, every point is known every 20ms. Therefore, the max of the samples is 10 000 ms / 20 ms = 500 samples. When the current sample == MaxSamples, I represent data in the graph calling the setDataGraph in the MainScreen activity. \r\n\r\nNormally it works fine. But if I am waiting some of the time, f.e. 5 minutes, and using my own profiler I can see that the DrawTime increases, and the problem I don&#39;t know why, and how I can fix it.\r\nIt works, but it is going to eat a lot of resources, and the graph starts lagging. \r\n\r\nI want to use GraphView because it is the View, and it can be easily implemented in the layout.\r\n\r\nIf you have any idea please Help Me. \r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n**Accelerometer.class()**\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport android.hardware.Sensor;\r\nimport android.hardware.SensorEvent;\r\nimport android.hardware.SensorEventListener;\r\nimport android.hardware.SensorManager;\r\n\r\npublic class Accelerometer   implements SensorEventListener{\r\n\r\n    private String ACCELEROMETER_NAME = &quot;ACCELEROMETER&quot;;\r\n    private double[] XYZ = new double[3];\r\n\r\n    private SensorManager AclManager;\r\n\r\n    private Hub hub;\r\n    private MainScreen mainScreen;\r\n    private int ACCELEROMETER_DELAY =  SensorManager.SENSOR_DELAY_GAME;//SENSOR_DELAY_GAME\r\n\r\n    Accelerometer(Hub hub, SensorManager Manager, Sensor SensorType){\r\n        this.hub = hub;\r\n        this.mainScreen = mainScreen;\r\n        AclManager = Manager;\r\n        AclManager.registerListener(this, SensorType, ACCELEROMETER_DELAY);

Code Improvment. Efficient way to draw using graphview. Linear Graph","body":"<p>I do a step counter.</p>\n<p>I read in a one book a method, how to calculate user's steps using  an accelerometer. I have Samsung Grand Premium (2014) which has only an accelerometer, so why I am designing the algorithm.</p>\n<p>The problem is I need to visualize some results in a graphview. I created 3 classes: Accelerometer, Hub and MainScreen.</p>\n<p>In the Accelerometer.class, I get the new value of the X,Y,Z in a certain period of time. After that I transmit data to Hub. The method IncomingData() receives data from Accelerometer. Then it has to analyze in the future, but now it just receives. This method also counts Samples. If we have 10 seconds window analysis, every point is known every 20ms. Therefore, the max of the samples is 10 000 ms / 20 ms = 500 samples. When the current sample == MaxSamples, I represent data in the graph calling the setDataGraph in the MainScreen activity.</p>\n<p>Normally it works fine. But if I am waiting some of the time, f.e. 5 minutes, and using my own profiler I can see that the DrawTime increases, and the problem I don't know why, and how I can fix it.\nIt works, but it is going to eat a lot of resources, and the graph starts lagging.</p>\n<p>I want to use GraphView because it is the View, and it can be easily implemented in the layout.</p>\n<p>If you have any idea please Help Me.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>Accelerometer.class()</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import android.hardware.Sensor;\nimport android.hardware.SensorEvent;\nimport android.hardware.SensorEventListener;\nimport android.hardware.SensorManager;\n\npublic class Accelerometer   implements SensorEventListener{\n\n    private String ACCELEROMETER_NAME = &quot;ACCELEROMETER&quot;;\n    private double[] XYZ = new double[3];\n\n    private SensorManager AclManager;\n\n    private Hub hub;\n    private MainScreen mainScreen;\n    private int ACCELEROMETER_DELAY =  SensorManager.SENSOR_DELAY_GAME;//SENSOR_DELAY_GAME\n\n    Accelerometer(Hub hub, SensorManager Manager, Sensor SensorType){\n        this.hub = hub;\n        this.mainScreen = mainScreen;\n        AclManager = Manager;\n        AclManager.registerListener(this, SensorType, ACCELEROMETER_DELAY);

This provides the &quot;[assisted injection][]&quot; functionality Guice offers via [FactoryModuleBuilder][], but with some extra benefits:\r\n\r\n  - You can keep using AutoFactory with Guice or Dagger or any other JSR-330 dependency injection framework, so you can keep using AutoFactory even if you switch between them.\r\n  - Because AutoFactory generates code, you don&#39;t need to write an interface to represent the constructor: AutoFactory will write a brand new type for you to compile against. (You can also specify an interface to implement, if you&#39;d prefer, or if you&#39;re migrating from Guice.)\r\n  - Because all the type inspection happens at compile-time, it produces plain old Java, which doesn&#39;t have any slowness due to reflection and which works well with debuggers and optimizers.

The long answer is, you&#39;ll never find a single example/solution which meets your exact needs, you will need to dissect them and remove those elements which you need.  This is a mark of a professional developer, believe me, I spend 90% of my time doing things I&#39;ve never done before (or have no initial idea of how to complete).\n\nWhen presented with a problem/idea, you need to take a step back and break it down into manageable components\n\nFrom my perspective you have two basic requirements, animation and transformation.\n\n# Animation\n\nAnimating is simply the illusions of change over time. On the surface, it seems very simple to achieve, in reality, it becomes [very complex, very quickly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28335787/how-can-i-implement-easing-functions-with-a-thread/28338188#28338188)\n\nIn Swing, the simplest solution is to use a [Swing Timer](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/timer.html), which generates regular updates, triggered within the context of the Event Dispatching Thread, making it safe to update the UI from (Swing, like most UI frameworks, been not thread safe).\n\nBecause of the way this works, it&#39;s not very precise, meaning you could end up with a variable frame rate. You can overcome this by using a [time based animation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23209060/how-to-animate-from-one-x-y-coordinate-to-another-java-processing/23210015#23210015) approach,  , where the movement is based on a duration of time, rather then the number of times the timer triggers.\n\nAnother solution is to use a thread, calculate the amount of time each update cycle takes and wait the remaining amount of time you need in order to maintain the FPS.  This is more complicated as you run into threading issues (dirty updates) and it doesn&#39;t take into account the amount of time it might take to actually render the graphics on the UI (when using Swing&#39;s passive rendering engine)\n\n# Transformation\n\nTransforming graphics (moving/rotating) will ultimately come down to &quot;what&quot; you&#39;re transforming.\n\nThe `Graphics2D` API has the capacity to rotate images, [for example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15779877/rotate-bufferedimage-inside-jpanel/15780090#15780090), [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14884480/rotate-an-image-in-java-by-the-specified-angle/14885645#14885645), [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14848053/image-not-at-proper-place-after-rotating-graphics/14851183#14851183), [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20275424/rotating-image-with-affinetransform/20280225#20280225), [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37758061/rotate-a-buffered-image-in-java/37758533#37758533), [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30204114/rotating-an-image-object/30204975#30204975).\n\nIt can also rotate the `Graphics` context itself, which can be messy, or rotate &quot;shapes&quot;, which generally easier to manage.\n\nYou should have a look at [Working with Geometry](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/geometry/index.html) and [Transforming Shapes, Text and Images](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/advanced/transforming.html) and [2D Graphics](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/) generally.\n\nYou can also move an object between points and change their orentation, as demonstrated [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23209060/how-to-animate-from-one-x-y-coordinate-to-another-java-processing/23210015#23210015) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35979697/java-basic-2d-game-animation-stutter/35979771#35979771) or you can use [path based animation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32392095/how-to-rotate-a-rectangle-after-reaching-specified-position/32397121#32397121) so that then object follows a pre-defined path for movement or even something more complex, like a time line based animation, [for example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26898536/moving-jlabel-to-other-jlabels-gui/26899099#26899099), [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30433074/jpanel-image-flies-from-the-screen/30433207#30433207), [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28961352/java-image-move-along-points-in-list-and-use-linear-interpolation/29000066#29000066)\n\nSo, the long answer is, it depends","title":"Implement fluctuating effect for sprite in Java Swing","body":"<p>Short answer is yes, it can be done.

This is more complicated as you run into threading issues (dirty updates) and it doesn't take into account the amount of time it might take to actually render the graphics on the UI (when using Swing's passive rendering engine)</p>\n<h1>Transformation</h1>\n<p>Transforming graphics (moving/rotating) will ultimately come down to &quot;what&quot; you're transforming.</p>\n<p>The <code>Graphics2D</code> API has the capacity to rotate images, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15779877/rotate-bufferedimage-inside-jpanel/15780090#15780090\">for example</a>, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14884480/rotate-an-image-in-java-by-the-specified-angle/14885645#14885645\">example</a>, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14848053/image-not-at-proper-place-after-rotating-graphics/14851183#14851183\">example</a>, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20275424/rotating-image-with-affinetransform/20280225#20280225\">example</a>, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37758061/rotate-a-buffered-image-in-java/37758533#37758533\">example</a>, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30204114/rotating-an-image-object/30204975#30204975\">example</a>.</p>\n<p>It can also rotate the <code>Graphics</code> context itself, which can be messy, or rotate &quot;shapes&quot;, which generally easier to manage.</p>\n<p>You should have a look at <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/geometry/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Working with Geometry</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/advanced/transforming.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Transforming Shapes, Text and Images</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2D Graphics</a> generally.</p>\n<p>You can also move an object between points and change their orentation, as demonstrated <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23209060/how-to-animate-from-one-x-y-coordinate-to-another-java-processing/23210015#23210015\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35979697/java-basic-2d-game-animation-stutter/35979771#35979771\">here</a> or you can use <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32392095/how-to-rotate-a-rectangle-after-reaching-specified-position/32397121#32397121\">path based animation</a> so that then object follows a pre-defined path for movement or even something more complex, like a time line based animation, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26898536/moving-jlabel-to-other-jlabels-gui/26899099#26899099\">for example</a>, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30433074/jpanel-image-flies-from-the-screen/30433207#30433207\">example</a>, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28961352/java-image-move-along-points-in-list-and-use-linear-interpolation/29000066#29000066\">example</a></p>\n<p>So, the long answer is, it depends</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":-1,"reputation":1,"user_id":-1,"display_name":"Community"},"score":1,"creation_date":1664861089,"post_id":73899850,"comment_id":130561109,"body_markdown":"As it’s currently written, your answer is unclear.

Profiles provided in the settings.xml are intended to provide local machine-\r\n   | specific paths and repository locations which allow the build to work in the local environment.\r\n   |\r\n   | For example, if you have an integration testing plugin - like cactus - that needs to know where\r\n   | your Tomcat instance is installed, you can provide a variable here such that the variable is\r\n   | dereferenced during the build process to configure the cactus plugin.\r\n   |\r\n   | As noted above, profiles can be activated in a variety of ways. One way - the activeProfiles\r\n   | section of this document (settings.xml) - will be discussed later. Another way essentially\r\n   | relies on the detection of a system property, either matching a particular value for the property,\r\n   | or merely testing its existence. Profiles can also be activated by JDK version prefix, where a\r\n   | value of &#39;1.4&#39; might activate a profile when the build is executed on a JDK version of &#39;1.4.2_07&#39;.\r\n   | Finally, the list of active profiles can be specified directly from the command line.\r\n   |\r\n   | NOTE: For profiles defined in the settings.xml, you are restricted to specifying only artifact\r\n   |       repositories, plugin repositories, and free-form properties to be used as configuration\r\n   |       variables for plugins in the POM.\r\n   |\r\n   |--&gt;\r\n  &lt;profiles&gt;\r\n    &lt;!-- profile\r\n     | Specifies a set of introductions to the build process, to be activated using one or more of the\r\n     | mechanisms described above. For inheritance purposes, and to activate profiles via &lt;activatedProfiles/&gt;\r\n     | or the command line, profiles have to have an ID that is unique.\r\n     |\r\n     | An encouraged best practice for profile identification is to use a consistent naming convention\r\n     | for profiles, such as &#39;env-dev&#39;, &#39;env-test&#39;, &#39;env-production&#39;, &#39;user-jdcasey&#39;, &#39;user-brett&#39;, etc.\r\n     | This will make it more intuitive to understand what the set of introduced profiles is attempting\r\n     | to accomplish, particularly when you only have a list of profile id&#39;s for debug.\r\n     |\r\n     | This profile example uses the JDK version to trigger activation, and provides a JDK-specific repo.\r\n    &lt;profile&gt;\r\n      &lt;id&gt;jdk-1.4&lt;/id&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;activation&gt;\r\n        &lt;jdk&gt;1.4&lt;/jdk&gt;\r\n      &lt;/activation&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;repositories&gt;\r\n        &lt;repository&gt;\r\n          &lt;id&gt;jdk14&lt;/id&gt;\r\n          &lt;name&gt;Repository for JDK 1.4 builds&lt;/name&gt;\r\n          &lt;url&gt;http://www.myhost.com/maven/jdk14&lt;/url&gt;\r\n          &lt;layout&gt;default&lt;/layout&gt;\r\n          &lt;snapshotPolicy&gt;always&lt;/snapshotPolicy&gt;\r\n        &lt;/repository&gt;\r\n      &lt;/repositories&gt;\r\n    &lt;/profile&gt;\r\n    --&gt;\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n    &lt;profile&gt;\r\n      &lt;id&gt;jdk-1.8&lt;/id&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;activation&gt;\r\n\t    &lt;activeByDefault&gt;true&lt;/activeByDefault&gt;\r\n        &lt;jdk&gt;1.8&lt;/jdk&gt;\r\n      &lt;/activation&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;properties&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;maven.compiler.source&gt;1.8&lt;/maven.compiler.source&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;maven.compiler.target&gt;1.8&lt;/maven.compiler.target&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;maven.compiler.compilerVersion&gt;1.8&lt;/maven.compiler.compilerVersion&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;/properties&gt;\r\n    &lt;/profile&gt;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n    &lt;!--\r\n     | Here is another profile, activated by the system property &#39;target-env&#39; with a value of &#39;dev&#39;,\r\n     | which provides a specific path to the Tomcat instance.

The mirror site will be the preferred\n   | server for that repository.\n   |--&gt;\n  &lt;mirrors&gt;\n    &lt;!-- mirror\n     | Specifies a repository mirror site to use instead of a given repository. The repository that\n     | this mirror serves has an ID that matches the mirrorOf element of this mirror. IDs are used\n     | for inheritance and direct lookup purposes, and must be unique across the set of mirrors.\n     |\n    &lt;mirror&gt;\n      &lt;id&gt;mirrorId&lt;/id&gt;\n      &lt;mirrorOf&gt;repositoryId&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;\n      &lt;name&gt;Human Readable Name for this Mirror.&lt;/name&gt;\n      &lt;url&gt;http://my.repository.com/repo/path&lt;/url&gt;\n    &lt;/mirror&gt;\n     --&gt;\n    &lt;mirror&gt;\n      &lt;id&gt;nexus-aliyun&lt;/id&gt;\n      &lt;mirrorOf&gt;central&lt;/mirrorOf&gt;\n      &lt;name&gt;Nexus aliyun&lt;/name&gt;\n      &lt;url&gt;http://maven.aliyun.com/nexus/content/groups/public&lt;/url&gt;\n    &lt;/mirror&gt;\n  &lt;/mirrors&gt;\n\n  &lt;!-- profiles\n   | This is a list of profiles which can be activated in a variety of ways, and which can modify\n   | the build process. Profiles provided in the settings.xml are intended to provide local machine-\n   | specific paths and repository locations which allow the build to work in the local environment.\n   |\n   | For example, if you have an integration testing plugin - like cactus - that needs to know where\n   | your Tomcat instance is installed, you can provide a variable here such that the variable is\n   | dereferenced during the build process to configure the cactus plugin.\n   |\n   | As noted above, profiles can be activated in a variety of ways. One way - the activeProfiles\n   | section of this document (settings.xml) - will be discussed later. Another way essentially\n   | relies on the detection of a system property, either matching a particular value for the property,\n   | or merely testing its existence. Profiles can also be activated by JDK version prefix, where a\n   | value of '1.4' might activate a profile when the build is executed on a JDK version of '1.4.2_07'.\n   | Finally, the list of active profiles can be specified directly from the command line.\n   |\n   | NOTE: For profiles defined in the settings.xml, you are restricted to specifying only artifact\n   |       repositories, plugin repositories, and free-form properties to be used as configuration\n   |       variables for plugins in the POM.\n   |\n   |--&gt;\n  &lt;profiles&gt;\n    &lt;!-- profile\n     | Specifies a set of introductions to the build process, to be activated using one or more of the\n     | mechanisms described above. For inheritance purposes, and to activate profiles via &lt;activatedProfiles/&gt;\n     | or the command line, profiles have to have an ID that is unique.\n     |\n     | An encouraged best practice for profile identification is to use a consistent naming convention\n     | for profiles, such as 'env-dev', 'env-test', 'env-production', 'user-jdcasey', 'user-brett', etc.\n     | This will make it more intuitive to understand what the set of introduced profiles is attempting\n     | to accomplish, particularly when you only have a list of profile id's for debug.\n     |\n     | This profile example uses the JDK version to trigger activation, and provides a JDK-specific repo.\n    &lt;profile&gt;\n      &lt;id&gt;jdk-1.4&lt;/id&gt;\n\n      &lt;activation&gt;\n        &lt;jdk&gt;1.4&lt;/jdk&gt;\n      &lt;/activation&gt;\n\n      &lt;repositories&gt;\n        &lt;repository&gt;\n          &lt;id&gt;jdk14&lt;/id&gt;\n          &lt;name&gt;Repository for JDK 1.4 builds&lt;/name&gt;\n          &lt;url&gt;http://www.myhost.com/maven/jdk14&lt;/url&gt;\n          &lt;layout&gt;default&lt;/layout&gt;\n          &lt;snapshotPolicy&gt;always&lt;/snapshotPolicy&gt;\n        &lt;/repository&gt;\n      &lt;/repositories&gt;\n    &lt;/profile&gt;\n    --&gt;\n    \n    \n    \n    &lt;profile&gt;\n      &lt;id&gt;jdk-1.8&lt;/id&gt;\n\n      &lt;activation&gt;\n        &lt;activeByDefault&gt;true&lt;/activeByDefault&gt;\n        &lt;jdk&gt;1.8&lt;/jdk&gt;\n      &lt;/activation&gt;\n\n      &lt;properties&gt;\n        &lt;maven.compiler.source&gt;1.8&lt;/maven.compiler.source&gt;\n        &lt;maven.compiler.target&gt;1.8&lt;/maven.compiler.target&gt;\n        &lt;maven.compiler.compilerVersion&gt;1.8&lt;/maven.compiler.compilerVersion&gt;\n      &lt;/properties&gt;\n    &lt;/profile&gt;\n    \n    \n\n    &lt;!--\n     | Here is another profile, activated by the system property 'target-env' with a value of 'dev',\n     | which provides a specific path to the Tomcat instance.

When the Java version of the JVM is not recognized, I think that the Eclipse behavior is not predictable.\r\n \r\n`java.lang.CharSequence` was introduced with Java 1.4, but my guess is that a too old version of Eclipse doesn’t recognize the `CharSequence` contained in the Java 8 JVM.\r\n\r\nJava 8 supports [default methods][1] in interfaces. And in JDK 8 a lot of old interfaces now have new default methods. For example, [now in CharSequence we have chars and codePoints methods][2] \r\n\r\nWhen using JDK 8 and an IDE with its own compiler, like Eclipse, you have to update the IDE to a version with Java 8 support, even if you are not using the newer Java 8 features.\r\n\r\nYou have 2 solutions, you can:\r\n\r\n* Use a Java Version that is compatible with your current IDE.\r\n* Update your Eclipse IDE\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nEclipse IDE with Java 8 support:\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThe first Eclipse version supporting Java 8 was Eclipse Kepler SR2 (4.3.2) with [an additional patch][3] that can [be downloaded][4] from the Marketplace.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion you should udpate to the [latest Eclipse Version][5].\r\n\r\nFor example, with the current stable version (Luna SR2; Version 4.4.2) no additional patch is necessary.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIdentifying the Eclipse Version and the JRE used by Eclipse\r\n=========\r\nGo to `Menu` &gt; `Help` &gt; `About Eclipse`. In the Dialog, click on the `Installation Details` Button and switch to the `Configuration` Tab.\r\n\r\n![About Eclipse][6]\r\n\r\nThe interesting lines are:\r\n\r\n    eclipse.buildId=4.5.0.I20150203-1300\r\n    ...\r\n    java.version=1.7.0_45\r\n\r\nOn the First `About Eclipse` Window, you have already the Eclipse Version and the Name of the distribution (Mars-M5) on the screenshot.\r\n\r\nBe aware that the JRE used by Eclipse itself is not necessary the JRE used by your java projects.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nJREs available in your Workspace:\r\n=========\r\n\r\nUsing `Windows` &gt; `Preferences` and `Java` &gt; `Installed JREs` in the page tree, you will define all available JREs.\r\n\r\n![Installed JREs][7]\r\n\r\nWith the `Add…` button, you can add as many JRE you like.\r\nThe checked JRE is the one that will be the “*Workspace default JRE*”.\r\n\r\nIf this is not the case you can add a new JRE with the add button.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAdditional concept: Execution Environment\r\n=========\r\n\r\nEclipse IDE defines an additional concept to “*Installed JREs*”: “*Execution Environment*”. A list of Environments is defined. For example: `JavaSE-1.6`, `JavaSE-1.7`, `JavaSE-1.8`... This list is hardcoded in the IDE and depends on the installed version.\r\n\r\nIn the preference page: `Java` &gt; `Installed JREs` &gt; `Execution Environment`, you can define which JRE will correspond to each specific environment.\r\n\r\n![Execution Environment - preference page][8]\r\n\r\nUsing this additional abstraction that is useful when you work in a team; You cannot guarantee that everyone will have the same installed JREs and will use the same id for each JRE will be used across a the team members. Execution Environment is a much stable denominator that can be shared in a team.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nEnsure the JRE System Library defined for your Project\r\n=========\r\n\r\nIn the Package Explorer, you should see the Java version:\r\n\r\n![Package Explorer][9]\r\n\r\nIf this is not correct you should open the context menu the `JRE System Library` item and select the `Properties` menu entry.\r\n\r\n![JRE System Library - Properties][10]\r\n\r\nYou can select:\r\n\r\n* One of the defined execution environments (mapped to a JRE in your preferences)\r\n* One of the available JRE defined in the preferences.\r\n* The workspace default JRE (also defined in the preferences)\r\n\r\nAt the root of your project you have a `.classpath` file (The file might be filtered out from the `Package Explorer View`, change the filter configuration or use the `Navigator View` to open the file). It should looks like this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n    &lt;classpath&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;classpathentry kind=&quot;src&quot; path=&quot;src&quot;/&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;classpathentry kind=&quot;con&quot; path=&quot;org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER/org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.launcher.StandardVMType/JavaSE-1.8&quot;/&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;classpathentry kind=&quot;output&quot; path=&quot;bin&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/classpath&gt;\r\n\r\nIn this case, the project uses the `JavaSE-1.8` execution environment.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIf you are using maven\r\n=========\r\n\r\nMaven also defines what the Java version should be. You need to synchronize the Eclipse settings with what is defined in the project `pom.xml` file.\r\n\r\nYou can achieve this with you can select `Maven` &gt; `Update project configuration` from the Context Menu available on your project.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nRebuild your project\r\n====================\r\n\r\nSometimes Eclipse is confused (in particular if you just changed some settings).
