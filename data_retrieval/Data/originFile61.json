I have unsuccessfully tried various approaches.\r\n\r\nAll existing integration tests use the H2 database through a `@Configuration` annotated class called `TestConfig`, seen below.\r\n\r\nAt first I tried setting `@TestPropertySource` annotations on the class and some setup using `@DynamicPropertySource`, [as shown in this guide][2], modified to work with JUnit 4 (using `@ClassRule`). That did not seem to do anything. I also had a look at the [Quickstart for JUnit 4][3] to see if I was missing something, but alas ... \r\n\r\nI then started hacking, _commenting out_ the `dataSource()` method in `TestConfig`, so that no `DataSource` bean was available, and *then* I was able to make the test run using my TestContainers setup, so there is some kind of ordering or precedence I need to control. \r\n\r\nAs can be seen below, the `TestConfig` class filters out the normal database config and application config, and creates alternate beans for the context.\r\n\r\n**TestConfig.java**\r\n```\r\n@Configuration\r\n@ComponentScan(basePackages = {&quot;com.base.package&quot;, &quot;com.base.commons&quot;},\r\n    excludeFilters = {\r\n        @ComponentScan.Filter(type = FilterType.ASSIGNABLE_TYPE, value = ApplicationConfig.class), \r\n        @ComponentScan.Filter(type = FilterType.ASSIGNABLE_TYPE, value = DatabaseConfig.class),\r\n    })\r\npublic class TestConfig {\r\n\r\n    @Bean // this is what I want to override!\r\n    public DataSource dataSource() {\r\n        EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder builder = new EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder();\r\n        builder.setType(EmbeddedDatabaseType.H2);\r\n        return builder.build();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**RateLimiterTest.java**\r\n```\r\n@WebAppConfiguration\r\n@ContextConfiguration(classes = {TestConfig.class})\r\npublic class RateLimiterTest extends AbstractJUnit4SpringContextTests {\r\n\r\n    @ClassRule\r\n    public static PostgreSQLContainer&lt;?&gt; postgres = new PostgreSQLContainer&lt;&gt;(&quot;postgres:11&quot;)\r\n            .withDatabaseName(&quot;prop&quot;)\r\n            .withUsername(&quot;postgres&quot;)\r\n            .withPassword(&quot;pass&quot;)\r\n            .withExposedPorts(5432);\r\n\r\n    @DynamicPropertySource\r\n    static void registerPgProperties(DynamicPropertyRegistry registry) {\r\n        registry.add(&quot;spring.datasource.url&quot;,\r\n                () -&gt; String.format(&quot;jdbc:postgresql://localhost:%d/prop&quot;, postgres.getFirstMappedPort()));\r\n        registry.add(&quot;spring.datasource.username&quot;, () -&gt; &quot;postgres&quot;);\r\n        registry.add(&quot;spring.datasource.password&quot;, () -&gt; &quot;pass&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow can I override the `TestConfig#dataSource()` method in a &quot;proper&quot; way?\r\n\r\nI also tried extending `TestConfig` like this and using this subclass in the single test class:\r\n```\r\nclass PostgresTestConfig extends TestConfig {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public DataSource dataSource() {\r\n        final var hikariDataSource = new HikariDataSource();\r\n        hikariDataSource.setJdbcUrl(&quot;jdbc:tc:postgresql:15:///databasename&quot;);\r\n        return hikariDataSource;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile that worked perfectly for this single test instance, it seems to leak out and change the &quot;global&quot; Spring setup, as `mvn test` will now fail on all subsequent tests, as it seems no beans can be created/found:\r\n\r\n```\r\n============================\r\nCONDITIONS EVALUATION REPORT\r\n============================\r\n\r\n\r\nPositive matches:\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n   AbstractBulkheadConfigurationOnMissingBean#bulkheadRegistry matched:\r\n      - @ConditionalOnMissingBean (types: io.github.resilience4j.bulkhead.BulkheadRegistry;

And also it allows you to create users dynamically for each test separately - a user that&#39;s needed for that particular test, with specifics needed for that test. 3) And sure, the order of columns most likely isn&#39;t guaranteed to match the order of fields. I&#39;d be surprised if it did. I doubt Java maintains the order - they&#39;re probably stored in a Hash Table."},{"owner":{"account_id":29772902,"reputation":49,"user_id":22817655,"display_name":"Kodigas"},"score":0,"creation_date":1700033435,"post_id":77485657,"comment_id":136603857,"body_markdown":"@StanislavBashkyrtsev `@Sql` is common practice for tests (though disabling ddl-auto is probably a common practice too)","body":"@StanislavBashkyrtsev <code>@Sql</code> is common practice for tests (though disabling ddl-auto is probably a common practice too)"},{"owner":{"account_id":476019,"reputation":14699,"user_id":886697,"accept_rate":92,"display_name":"Stanislav Bashkyrtsev"},"score":0,"creation_date":1700034118,"post_id":77485657,"comment_id":136603935,"body_markdown":"Yes, it is a common practice.

I added the code snippet here-</p>\n<pre><code>@Override\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    binding = ActivityViewProfileBinding.inflate(getLayoutInflater());\n    setContentView(binding.getRoot());\n\n    ArrayList&lt;Users&gt; user_list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); //Users is the model class\n\n    FirebaseDatabase.getInstance().getReference().child(&quot;users&quot;).addValueEventListener(new ValueEventListener() {\n        @Override\n        public void onDataChange(@NonNull DataSnapshot snapshot) {\n            user_list.clear();\n            for(DataSnapshot ss: snapshot.getChildren()){\n                Users us = ss.getValue(Users.class);\n                user_list.add(us); //adding the model class to the ArrayList\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void onCancelled(@NonNull DatabaseError error) {\n            Toast.makeText(ViewProfileActivity.this, error.getMessage(), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n        }\n    });\n\n    Toast.makeText(this, String.valueOf(user_list.size()), Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>What could be the problem here? The toast shows &quot;0&quot; that means no data whatsoever inside the <strong>ArrayList</strong>. What am I missing here?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":14722107,"reputation":5143,"user_id":10632369,"display_name":"tomerpacific"},"score":1,"creation_date":1699973222,"post_id":77481479,"comment_id":136595945,"body_markdown":"Can you share your AndroidManifest.xml file?

It strives to be RFC-compliant and includes extensive documentation and many useful features while keeping bloat to a minimum.</p>\n\n<p>Features include: virtual hosts, file serving from disk, mime type mappings via standard mime.types file, directory index generation, welcome files, support for all HTTP methods, conditional ETags and If-* header support, chunked transfer encoding, gzip/deflate compression, basic HTTPS (as provided by the JVM), partial content (download continuation), multipart/form-data handling for file uploads, multiple context handlers via API or annotations, parameter parsing (query string or x-www-form-urlencoded body), etc.</p>\n\n<p>I hope others find it useful :-)</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3346139,"reputation":14655,"user_id":2811258,"accept_rate":88,"display_name":"Johnny"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1498734884,"creation_date":1498734884,"answer_id":44823593,"question_id":3732109,"body_markdown":"You can write a pretty simple [embedded Jetty][1] Java server.\r\n\r\nEmbedded Jetty means that the server (Jetty) shipped together with the application as opposed of deploying the application on external Jetty server.\r\n\r\nSo if in non-embedded approach your webapp built into WAR file which deployed to some external server ([Tomcat][2] / Jetty / etc), in embedded Jetty, you write the webapp and instantiate the jetty server in the same code base.\r\n\r\nAn example for embedded Jetty Java server you can [git clone][3] and use: https://github.com/stas-slu/embedded-jetty-java-server-example\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/9.4.x/embedding-jetty.html\r\n  [2]: http://tomcat.apache.org/\r\n  [3]: https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop/","title":"Simple HTTP server in Java using only Java SE API","body":"<p>You can write a pretty simple <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/9.4.x/embedding-jetty.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">embedded Jetty</a> Java server.</p>\n\n<p>Embedded Jetty means that the server (Jetty) shipped together with the application as opposed of deploying the application on external Jetty server.</p>\n\n<p>So if in non-embedded approach your webapp built into WAR file which deployed to some external server (<a href=\"http://tomcat.apache.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tomcat</a> / Jetty / etc), in embedded Jetty, you write the webapp and instantiate the jetty server in the same code base.</p>\n\n<p>An example for embedded Jetty Java server you can <a href=\"https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">git clone</a> and use: <a href=\"https://github.com/stas-slu/embedded-jetty-java-server-example\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/stas-slu/embedded-jetty-java-server-example</a></p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":7439229,"reputation":105,"user_id":5657520,"display_name":"Devashish Priyadarshi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1554746916,"creation_date":1526022077,"answer_id":50286769,"question_id":3732109,"body_markdown":"Try this https://github.com/devashish234073/Java-Socket-Http-Server/blob/master/README.md\r\n\r\nThis API has creates an HTTP server using sockets. \r\n\r\n 1.

And I wrote some performance tests (see results below):\r\n\r\n**Ways to convert an InputStream to a String:**\r\n\r\n1. Using `IOUtils.toString` (Apache Utils) \r\n\r\n        String result = IOUtils.toString(inputStream, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\r\n\r\n2. Using `CharStreams` (Guava) \r\n\r\n        String result = CharStreams.toString(new InputStreamReader(\r\n              inputStream, Charsets.UTF_8));\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Using `Scanner` (JDK) \r\n\r\n        Scanner s = new Scanner(inputStream).useDelimiter(&quot;\\\\A&quot;);\r\n        String result = s.hasNext() ? s.next() : &quot;&quot;;\r\n\r\n4. Using **Stream API** (Java 8). **Warning**: This solution converts different line breaks (like `\\r\\n`) to `\\n`.\r\n   \r\n\r\n        String result = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream))\r\n          .lines().collect(Collectors.joining(&quot;\\n&quot;));\r\n       \r\n5. Using **parallel Stream API** (Java 8). **Warning**: This solution converts different line breaks (like `\\r\\n`) to `\\n`.    \r\n\r\n        String result = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream))\r\n           .lines().parallel().collect(Collectors.joining(&quot;\\n&quot;));\r\n\r\n6. Using `InputStreamReader` and `StringBuilder` (JDK) \r\n\r\n        int bufferSize = 1024;\r\n        char[] buffer = new char[bufferSize];\r\n        StringBuilder out = new StringBuilder();\r\n        Reader in = new InputStreamReader(stream, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\r\n        for (int numRead; (numRead = in.read(buffer, 0, buffer.length)) &gt; 0; ) {\r\n            out.append(buffer, 0, numRead);\r\n        }\r\n        return out.toString();\r\n\r\n7. Using `StringWriter` and `IOUtils.copy` (Apache Commons)\r\n\r\n        StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();\r\n        IOUtils.copy(inputStream, writer, &quot;UTF-8&quot;);\r\n        return writer.toString();\r\n\r\n8. Using `ByteArrayOutputStream` and `inputStream.read` (JDK)  \r\n\r\n        ByteArrayOutputStream result = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\r\n        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\r\n        for (int length; (length = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1; ) {\r\n            result.write(buffer, 0, length);\r\n        }\r\n        // StandardCharsets.UTF_8.name() &gt; JDK 7\r\n        return result.toString(&quot;UTF-8&quot;);\r\n\r\n9. Using `BufferedReader` (JDK). **Warning:** This solution converts different line breaks (like `\\n\\r`) to `line.separator` system property (for example, in Windows to &quot;\\r\\n&quot;).\r\n\r\n        String newLine = System.getProperty(&quot;line.separator&quot;);\r\n        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(\r\n                new InputStreamReader(inputStream));\r\n        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();\r\n        for (String line; (line = reader.readLine()) != null; ) {\r\n            if (result.length() &gt; 0) {\r\n                result.append(newLine);\r\n            }\r\n            result.append(line);\r\n        }\r\n        return result.toString();\r\n\r\n10. Using `BufferedInputStream` and `ByteArrayOutputStream` (JDK) \r\n\r\n        BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(inputStream);\r\n        ByteArrayOutputStream buf = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\r\n        for (int result = bis.read(); result != -1; result = bis.read()) {\r\n            buf.write((byte) result);\r\n        }\r\n        // StandardCharsets.UTF_8.name() &gt; JDK 7\r\n        return buf.toString(&quot;UTF-8&quot;);\r\n\r\n11. Using `inputStream.read()` and `StringBuilder` (JDK). **Warning**: This solution has problems with Unicode, for example with Russian text (works correctly only with non-Unicode text)\r\n\r\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\r\n        for (int ch; (ch = inputStream.read()) != -1; ) {\r\n            sb.append((char) ch);\r\n        }\r\n        return sb.toString();\r\n\r\n**Warning**:\r\n\r\n 1. Solutions 4, 5 and 9 convert different line breaks to one.\r\n\r\n 2. Solution 11 can&#39;t work correctly with Unicode text\r\n\r\n**Performance tests**\r\n\r\nPerformance tests for small `String` (length = 175), url in [github][1] (mode = Average Time, system = Linux, score 1,343 is the best):\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-none --&gt;\r\n\r\n                  Benchmark                         Mode  Cnt   Score   Error  Units\r\n     8.

From there it&#39;s simple to build the string using a `StringBuilder`.  Another important part of `InputStreamReader` is specifying the character encoding.

You&#39;ve allocated your buffer so there is zero advantage added by wrapping your InputStream in a BufferedInputStream.  Now if you are calling `InputStream.read()` or `Reader.read()` then yes those classes are providing a speed boost by converting single byte/char reads into buffered reads.

Never really used with newer versions though. Quick tests worked with Java 11, not Java 15*\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s how I&#39;m doing it:\r\n\r\n 1. Have the dlls stored in your application path. For instance:\r\n```\r\nproject_root\r\n├─src (or any other source path structure)\r\n│ └─...packages...\r\n└─extlib\r\n  └─SqlJdbc\r\n    └─auth\r\n      ├─x64\r\n      │ └─sqljdbc_auth.dll\r\n      └─x86\r\n        └─sqljdbc_auth.dll\r\n```\r\n 2. Use the following static initialization code in the class that makes JDBC connection *(java &lt;= 11 version)*:\r\n```java\r\nstatic {\r\n    File file;\r\n    if (&quot;64&quot;.equals(System.getProperty(&quot;sun.arch.data.model&quot;)))\r\n        file = new File(&quot;./extlib/SqlJdbc/auth/x64&quot;);\r\n    else\r\n        file = new File(&quot;./extlib/SqlJdbc/auth/x86&quot;);\r\n    String dllPath;\r\n\ttry {\r\n\t\tdllPath = file.getCanonicalPath();\r\n\t    synchronized(Runtime.getRuntime()) {\r\n\t    \tfinal Field usrPathsField = ClassLoader.class.getDeclaredField(&quot;usr_paths&quot;);\r\n\t        usrPathsField.setAccessible(true);\r\n\t        Object o = usrPathsField.get(null);\r\n            String[] paths = o == null ? new String[0] : (String[]) o;\r\n            if (!Arrays.stream(paths).anyMatch(s -&gt; dllPath.equals(s))) {\r\n\t            String[] usr_paths = Arrays.copyOf(paths, paths.length + 1);\r\n\t            usr_paths[paths.length] = file.getCanonicalPath();\r\n\t            usrPathsField.set(null, usr_paths);\r\n            }\r\n\t    }\r\n        DriverManager.registerDriver(new SQLServerDriver());\r\n\t} catch (Exception e) {\r\n\t\te.printStackTrace();\r\n\t\tthrow new ExceptionInInitializerError(e);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAccording to [this answer][2], you should be able to push it to at least Java &lt;= 13 using `MethodHandles.privateLookupIn` instead of `ClassLoader.class.getDeclaredField`. For instance:\r\n```java\r\nLookup cl = MethodHandles.privateLookupIn(ClassLoader.class, MethodHandles.lookup());\r\nVarHandle usrPathsField= cl.findStaticVarHandle(ClassLoader.class, &quot;usr_paths&quot;, String[].class);\r\nObject o = usrPathsField.get();\r\n...\r\nusrPathsField.set(usr_paths);\r\n```\r\n*It&#39;s definitely broken with Java 15, as field `usr_paths` doesn&#39;t exist anymore in `ClassLoader`*\r\n\r\n***At this point, you should be able to run your code from IDE***\r\n\r\n3. Deploy the directory containing dlls (i.e. `extlib`) alongside your jar. For Maven, you can use the following in pom.xml:\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;plugin&gt;\r\n\t&lt;artifactId&gt;maven-resources-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t&lt;version&gt;3.0.2&lt;/version&gt;\r\n\t&lt;executions&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;execution&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;id&gt;copy-resources&lt;/id&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;phase&gt;prepare-package&lt;/phase&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;goals&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;goal&gt;copy-resources&lt;/goal&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;/goals&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;configuration&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;outputDirectory&gt;${project.build.directory}/extlib&lt;/outputDirectory&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;resources&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;resource&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&lt;directory&gt;extlib&lt;/directory&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&lt;filtering&gt;false&lt;/filtering&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;/resource&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;/resources&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/execution&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/executions&gt;\r\n&lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom there, if you need your dlls packed inside your jar, you can do so using `maven-resources-plugin`, and unpack the required dll at runtime, and then force it onto the library path using a variation of above code.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/15409446/3410989\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/59468135/3410989","title":"How to add sqljdbc_auth.dll to my maven project","body":"<p>Based on information found in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/15409446/3410989\">this answer</a>, you could do it by injecting the dll into <code>java.library.path</code> at runtime.</p>\n<p><em>I've had this running in production for a few years now with no problem on Java &lt;= 8.

See [What&#39;s wrong with Java Date &amp; Time API?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/1969442/642706) for some discussion. Joda-Time was the first good date-time library in the industry, and inspired its replacement, the java.time classes built into Java 8 and later.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll be somewhat brief as all of this has been covered *many* times already on Stack Overflow.\r\n\r\nWork in UTC. In Java that means the `Instant` class is commonly used. The [`Instant`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html) class represents a moment on the timeline in [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) with a resolution of [nanoseconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosecond) (up to nine (9) digits of a decimal fraction). \r\n\r\n    Instant instant = Instant.now();\r\n\r\nAny serious database such as Postgres tracks date-time values in UTC. Your JDBC driver handles the detail of converting from database internally-stored data to a Java type. JDBC drivers that comply with [JDBC 4.2][2] and later can directly handle java.time types via `PreparedStatement::setObject ` &amp; `ResultSet::getObject ` methods. \r\n\r\n    myPreparedStatement.setObject( … , instant );\r\n\r\nFor non-compliant drivers, fall back to using java.sql types such as `java.sql.Timestamp` to communicate with database, and convert to/from java.time types via new methods added to the old classes. The internal details of how the database handles date-time values may be quite different than how java.time does. For the most part the JDBC driver hides all the nitty-gritty details from you. But one critical issue is resolution, which you should study in your database. The java.time classes handle date-times with a resolution up to [nanoseconds][3] but your database may not. For example, Postgres uses a resolution of [microseconds][4]. So going back-and-forth means data-loss. You want to use the truncation methods on the java.time classes to match your database.\r\n\r\n    myPreparedStatement.setTimestamp( … , java.sql.Timestamp.from( instant ) );\r\n\r\nSo, no time zone involved. So no “worrying about time-zones while handling database Date”.\r\n\r\nWhen you want to see the same moment through the lens of a region’s [wall-clock time][5], apply a `ZoneId` to get a [`ZonedDateTime`][6].\r\n\r\n    ZoneId z = ZoneId.of( &quot;Asia/Kolkata&quot; );\r\n    ZonedDateTime zdt = instant.atZone( z );\r\n\r\nWhen taking a zoned date-time back to the database, extract an `Instant`.\r\n\r\n    Instant instant = zdt.toInstant();\r\n\r\nBe aware that for any given moment, the date as well as the time-of-day varies around the globe by time zone. So if an exact moment matters, such as when a contract expires, beware of using a date-only value. Either use a date-time value for the exact moment, or store the intended time zone alongside the date-only so the exact moment can be calculated later.\r\n\r\n    LocalDate ld = LocalDate.of( 2016, 1 , 1 );\r\n    // Determine the first moment of 2016-01-01 as it happens in Kolkata.\r\n    ZonedDateTime zdt = ld.atStartOfDay( ZoneId.of( &quot;Asia/Kolkata&quot; ) ); \r\n    Instant instant = zdt.toInstant();  // Adjust to UTC and store. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n# About java.time\r\n\r\nThe [java.time](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html) framework is built into Java 8 and later. These classes supplant the troublesome old [legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system) date-time classes such as [`java.util.Date`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Date.html), [`.Calendar`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html), &amp; [`java.text.SimpleDateFormat`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html).\r\n\r\nThe [Joda-Time](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) project, now in [maintenance mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_mode), advises migration to java.time.\r\n\r\nTo learn more, see the [Oracle Tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/TOC.html). And search Stack Overflow for many examples and explanations. Specification is [JSR 310](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310).\r\n\r\nWhere to obtain the java.time classes? \r\n\r\n - [**Java SE 8**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_8) and [**SE 9**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_9) and later\r\n  - Built-in. \r\n  - Part of the standard Java API with a bundled implementation.\r\n  - Java 9 adds some minor features and fixes.\r\n - [**Java SE 6**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_6) and [**SE 7**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_7)\r\n  - Much of the java.time functionality is back-ported to Java 6 &amp; 7 in [***ThreeTen-Backport***](http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/).\r\n - [**Android**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system))\r\n  - The [*ThreeTenABP*](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP) project adapts ***ThreeTen-Backport*** (mentioned above) for Android specifically.\r\n  - See [*How to use…*](https://stackoverflow.com/q/38922754/642706).\r\n\r\nThe [ThreeTen-Extra](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/) project extends java.time with additional classes. This project is a proving ground for possible future additions to java.time.

The <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Instant</code></a> class represents a moment on the timeline in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">UTC</a> with a resolution of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosecond\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">nanoseconds</a> (up to nine (9) digits of a decimal fraction).</p>\n<pre><code>Instant instant = Instant.now();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any serious database such as Postgres tracks date-time values in UTC. Your JDBC driver handles the detail of converting from database internally-stored data to a Java type. JDBC drivers that comply with <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/1081234/642706\">JDBC 4.2</a> and later can directly handle java.time types via <code>PreparedStatement::setObject </code> &amp; <code>ResultSet::getObject </code> methods.</p>\n<pre><code>myPreparedStatement.setObject( … , instant );\n</code></pre>\n<p>For non-compliant drivers, fall back to using java.sql types such as <code>java.sql.Timestamp</code> to communicate with database, and convert to/from java.time types via new methods added to the old classes. The internal details of how the database handles date-time values may be quite different than how java.time does. For the most part the JDBC driver hides all the nitty-gritty details from you. But one critical issue is resolution, which you should study in your database. The java.time classes handle date-times with a resolution up to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosecond\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">nanoseconds</a> but your database may not. For example, Postgres uses a resolution of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsecond\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">microseconds</a>. So going back-and-forth means data-loss. You want to use the truncation methods on the java.time classes to match your database.</p>\n<pre><code>myPreparedStatement.setTimestamp( … , java.sql.Timestamp.from( instant ) );\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, no time zone involved. So no “worrying about time-zones while handling database Date”.</p>\n<p>When you want to see the same moment through the lens of a region’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall-clock_time\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wall-clock time</a>, apply a <code>ZoneId</code> to get a <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/ZonedDateTime.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>ZonedDateTime</code></a>.</p>\n<pre><code>ZoneId z = ZoneId.of( &quot;Asia/Kolkata&quot; );\nZonedDateTime zdt = instant.atZone( z );\n</code></pre>\n<p>When taking a zoned date-time back to the database, extract an <code>Instant</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>Instant instant = zdt.toInstant();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Be aware that for any given moment, the date as well as the time-of-day varies around the globe by time zone. So if an exact moment matters, such as when a contract expires, beware of using a date-only value. Either use a date-time value for the exact moment, or store the intended time zone alongside the date-only so the exact moment can be calculated later.</p>\n<pre><code>LocalDate ld = LocalDate.of( 2016, 1 , 1 );\n// Determine the first moment of 2016-01-01 as it happens in Kolkata.\nZonedDateTime zdt = ld.atStartOfDay( ZoneId.of( &quot;Asia/Kolkata&quot; ) ); \nInstant instant = zdt.toInstant();  // Adjust to UTC and store. \n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<h1>About java.time</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">java.time</a> framework is built into Java 8 and later.
