showing the <code>sum</code> for <strong>each</strong> student during the <code>actual month</code>.</p>\n<p>So I have created the <code>SyntheticRow</code> class with these properties:</p>\n<pre><code>Long syntheticRowId;\nLocalDate date;\nMap&lt;Long, String&gt;

If that object is not null we are going to do the following things.\r\n\r\n   a. We can mutate the  object (I)\r\n\r\n   b. We can return something(O) as output instead of mutating the object (I)\r\n\r\n   c. we can do both\r\n\r\nIn this case, We need to pass a function which needs to take the input param(I) which is our object If we take it like that, then we can mutate that object if we want. and also that function may be something (O). \r\n\r\n\r\n2. If an object is null then we are going to do the following things\r\n\r\n    a. We may throw an exception in a customized way\r\n\r\n    b. We may return something.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the object is null so we need to supply the value or we may need to throw an exception.\r\n\r\nI take two examples.\r\n\r\n1. If I want to execute trim in a String then that string should not be null. In that case, we have to additionally check the null value otherwise we will get NullPointerException\r\n```\r\npublic String trimValue(String s){\r\n   return s == null ? null : s.trim();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Another function which I want to set a new value to object if that object is not null otherwise I want to throw a runtime exception.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic void setTeacherAge(Teacher teacher, int age){\r\n   if (teacher != null){\r\n      teacher.setAge(age);\r\n   } else{\r\n      throw new RuntimeException(&quot;teacher is null&quot;)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nWith my Explanation, I have created a generic method that takes the value(value may be null), a function that will execute if the object is not null and another supplier function that will execute if the object is null.\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt; GenericFunction &lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  public &lt;I, O&gt; O setNullCheckExecutor(I value, Function&lt;I, O&gt; nonNullExecutor, Supplier&lt;O&gt; nullExecutor) {\r\n        return value != null ? nonNullExecutor.apply(value) : nullExecutor.get();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nSo after having this generic function, we can do as follow for the example methods\r\n1. \r\n\r\n```Java\r\n//To Trim a value\r\n        String trimmedValue = setNullCheckExecutor(value, String::trim, () -&gt; null);\r\n\r\n```\r\nHere, the nonNullExecutor Function is trim the value (Method Reference is used). nullExecutorFunction is will return null since It is an identity function.\r\n\r\n2. \r\n```Java\r\n// mutate the object if not null otherwise throw a custom message runtime exception instead of NullPointerException\r\n setNullCheckExecutor(teacher, teacher -&gt; {\r\n            teacher.setAge(19);\r\n            return null;\r\n        }, () -&gt; {\r\n            throw new RuntimeException(&quot;Teacher is null&quot;);\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/rcvaram/NullUtil/blob/master/README.md","title":"Best way to check for null values in Java?","body":"<h1> Update </h1>\nI created a java library(Maven Dependency) for the java developers to remove this NullPointerException Hell from their code.\nCheck out my repository. \n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rcvaram/NullUtil/blob/master/README.md\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">NullUtil Repository</a></p>\n<h1> Generic Method to handle Null Values in Java </h1>\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;script src=\"https://gist.github.com/rcvaram/f1a1b89193baa1de39121386d5f865bc.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>If that object is not null we are going to do the following things.</p>\n<p>a.

already running in Kubernetes which is scheduled for 4 hours.\r\n\r\nIf I&#39;m not mistaken, it&#39;s not possible to schedule a Job on Kubernetes, you need to create a Job from a CronJob, that&#39;s our case.\r\nWe have several CronJobs scheduled to start through the day, but it&#39;s also needed to start it again, during some error or something else.\r\n\r\nAfter some research, I decided to use the [Kubernetes-client][1] library.\r\n\r\nWhen it was needed to trigger a job manually, I used to use kubectl CLI `kubectl create job batch-demo-job --from=cronjob/batch-demo-cronjob -n ns-batch-demo `, so I was also seeking for a way that makes that possible.\r\n\r\nFrom an [issue][2] opened on the Kubernetes-client GitHub it is not possible to do that, you need to search for your cronJob, then use the spec to create your job.\r\n\r\nSo I&#39;ve made it a POC and it works as expected, it follows the same logic, but in a more friendly way.\r\n\r\nIn this example, I just need the cronJob spec

needed for me and my team, to develop a web application, that makes it possible for any user to start a new execution from our jobs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have a job already running in Kubernetes which is scheduled for 4 hours.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If I'm not mistaken, it's not possible to schedule a Job on Kubernetes, you need to create a Job from a CronJob, that's our case.\nWe have several CronJobs scheduled to start through the day, but it's also needed to start it again, during some error or something else.</p>\n<p>After some research, I decided to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-client/java\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kubernetes-client</a> library.</p>\n<p>When it was needed to trigger a job manually, I used to use kubectl CLI <code>kubectl create job batch-demo-job --from=cronjob/batch-demo-cronjob -n ns-batch-demo </code>, so I was also seeking for a way that makes that possible.</p>\n<p>From an <a href=\"https://github.com/godaddy/kubernetes-client/issues/443\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">issue</a> opened on the Kubernetes-client GitHub it is not possible to do that, you need to search for your cronJob, then use the spec to create your job.</p>\n<p>So I've made it a POC and it works as expected, it follows the same logic, but in a more friendly way.</p>\n<p>In this example, I just need the cronJob spec to get the volume tag.</p>\n<pre><code>fun createJobFromACronJob(namespace: String) {\n    val client = Config.defaultClient()\n    Configuration.setDefaultApiClient(client)\n\n\n    try

Let&#39;s say the key is some string in a variable called key.  You find the hashcode by doing `int hc = key.hashCode();`.  Let&#39;s say you have an array of size 100 to hold the buckets.  You could get the index by doing `int index = hc%100` which gives you a remainder between 0 and 99 inclusive.

The following list is all the places where specifications related to this topic exist, as far as I know:\r\n\r\n - (a)[JSL 17.4.MemoryModel][3]\r\n - (b)[JSL 12.6.Finalization of Class Instances][4], especially (b2)[12.6.2.

If not, how can we prove that based on the specifications written in (a)(b)(c)(d) or anywhere else?\r\n\r\nAlthough the answer to the first question may be enough for my use, I also want the specifications in (c) and in (d) to become clear, so let me ask more questions below.\r\n\r\nFirst, (c)WeakReference says that **at a certain point of time** the gc determines objects to be weakly-reachable, at the same time clears weak refs, and at the same time declares those objects as finalizable. According to (b2), reachability checks and finalizability declarations take place at **reachability decision points**. So the &quot;certain point of time&quot; must be one of the reachability decision points, right **?** If so, other questions come up. (b2) also says reachability desicion points are NOT actual points (unlike writes and reads) in the code or on the program order; they are virtual points that are only related to actions through come-before / come-after relations, which are independent of program ordering. So... weak refs are cleared at the decision point, which is not anywhere on the code. What does it exactly mean **?** On what condition can `WeakReference#get()` be null? cannot be null? Is it the come-before / come-after relation between the decision point and the `WeakReference#get()` that we need? Or the come-before / after relation between the decision point and some other action which has a certain memory-model-related relation to the `WeakReference#get()`?\r\n\r\nNext, (d)reachabilityFence. It says a call of this method keeps the object&#39;s strong reachability and \r\nthus makes it unreclaimable until after the call. Can I interpret it as saying that the call keeps the object&#39;s strong reachability until after the call **?** Technically it is not saying so. But if there is no specification about until when the strong reachability are kept, the part about keeping the strong reachability is useless. (And the other half talking about the undefined concept &quot;unreclaimability&quot; is useless from the beginning.) So the strong reachability is maintained until after the call -- but what does the word &#39;after&#39; exactly mean **?** Program order? Happens before? The order in which comissions take place? Besides, I think objects become unreachable at a certain decision point as described in (b2). What determines whether a certain call of reachabilityFence affects a certain decision point or it does not? The come-before / come-after relation between the fence and the decision point? Obviously not, because since the call of fence is neither a write nor a read nor a synchronization action, it makes no difference whether a certain fence call comes-before or comes-after a certain decision point.\r\n\r\nI suspect (c) and (d) are too vague and thus it is impossible to answer basic questions like my first one.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/ref/Reference.html#reachabilityFence(java.lang.Object)\r\n  [2]:\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/ref/WeakReference.html\r\n  [3]:\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4\r\n  [4]:\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html/jls-12.html#jls-12.6\r\n  [5]:\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html/jls-12.html#jls-12.6.2\r\n","title":"WeakReference, reachabilityFence, and Java Memory Model","body":"<p>Suppose <code>ref</code> is a <code>WeakReference</code> object pointing to (or at a certain moment having pointed to) an object <code>obj</code>.
