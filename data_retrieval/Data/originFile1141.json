So why would you expect them to be the same.\r\n\r\nPresumably, the Eclipse team decided that their IDE&#39;s console emulator should use the OS platform&#39;s line separator (`\\r\\n`), and the Netbeans team thought that the UNIX / Linux way was a better idea.\r\n\r\nWhy?  Ask the implementors!\r\n\r\nWhich is correct?

The concept of exceptions means that they are thrown in, well, exceptional cases. They are meant to be caught at the place they will be handled (or at the least re-thrown after some local cleanup/logging/etc.). They are not meant to be handed around like this (that is, in &quot;domain&quot; code).\r\n\r\nPeople will be confused. Real bugs can easily creep it - for example, what if there is some `Exception` from some other source than networking here; one you did not anticipate, that is really bad (like some out-of-bounds exception that you created by some programming error)?\r\n\r\nAnd fresh programmers will be endlessly confused, and/or copy that anti-pattern to places where it just doesn&#39;t belong.\r\n\r\nFor example, a colleague recently implemented a quite complicated interface (as in machine-to-machine interface, not Java `interface`), and he did a similar exception handling; converting exceptions to silently ignored variations (modulo some log messages). Needless to say, *any* exception that he was not actually expecting broke the whole mess in the worst imaginable way; the opposite of [fail fast][1].\r\n\r\n&gt; It is an anti-pattern to use Exceptions to control the workflow and we should only return boolean from  serviceUp() and never the Exception object itself. The argument is that using Exceptions to control the workflow is an anti-pattern.\r\n\r\nExceptions most certainly control the workflow in the aspect that they often abort it, or redirect to an error message displayed to the user.

The concept of exceptions means that they are thrown in, well, exceptional cases. They are meant to be caught at the place they will be handled (or at the least re-thrown after some local cleanup/logging/etc.). They are not meant to be handed around like this (that is, in \"domain\" code).</p>\n\n<p>People will be confused. Real bugs can easily creep it - for example, what if there is some <code>Exception</code> from some other source than networking here; one you did not anticipate, that is really bad (like some out-of-bounds exception that you created by some programming error)?</p>\n\n<p>And fresh programmers will be endlessly confused, and/or copy that anti-pattern to places where it just doesn't belong.</p>\n\n<p>For example, a colleague recently implemented a quite complicated interface (as in machine-to-machine interface, not Java <code>interface</code>), and he did a similar exception handling; converting exceptions to silently ignored variations (modulo some log messages). Needless to say, <em>any</em> exception that he was not actually expecting broke the whole mess in the worst imaginable way; the opposite of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast\" rel=\"noreferrer\">fail fast</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is an anti-pattern to use Exceptions to control the workflow and we should only return boolean from  serviceUp() and never the Exception object itself. The argument is that using Exceptions to control the workflow is an anti-pattern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Exceptions most certainly control the workflow in the aspect that they often abort it, or redirect to an error message displayed to the user. It is absolutely possible to have some part of the code \"disabled\" due to an exception; i.e., exception handling is surely allowed somewhere else than just at the top level of control.</p>\n\n<p>But returning exceptions is indeed an anti-pattern; nobody expects that, it is weird, it leads to spurious errors (it is easy to ignore the return value) etc. etc.</p>\n\n<p>So, in the case of your <code>serviceUp()</code>, either make it <code>void</code> - it either works 99% of the time, or throws an exception; or make it true <code>boolean</code> in that you fully well accept that it will fail somewhere.

Return boolean\r\n\r\nThe first one is to return `boolean`. This style is widely used in C and C-style APIs, like PHP. This leads - for example in PHP - often to code like this:\r\n\r\n    if (xyz_parse($data) === FALSE)\r\n        $error = xyz_last_error();\r\n\r\nThe downsides to this are obvious, this is why it has fallen out of fashion more and more, especially in OOP languages and languages with exception-handling.\r\n\r\n### 2. Use an intermediary/state/result object\r\n\r\nIf you do not use exceptions, you still have the opportunity in OOP languages to return *objects* that describe the *state*.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you receive input from the user and want to validate the input, you know *beforehand* that you might get garbage and that the result will quite often *not* validate, and you might write code like this:\r\n\r\n    ValidationResult result = parser.validate(data);\r\n    if (result.isValid())\r\n        // business logic\r\n    else\r\n        error = result.getvalidationError();\r\n\r\n### 3. Use exceptions\r\n\r\nJava does this as you have shown with sockets. The reasoning is that creating a connection *should* succeed and only fails in *exceptional* circumstances which need special handling.\r\n\r\n## Applying it\r\n\r\nIn your case, I would just throw the exception directly, and even drop the helper method.Your helper method is badly named. It doesn&#39;t actually *query* whether the service is up (as the name suggests), but instead simply *connects*.\r\n\r\n### Use (checked) exceptions \r\n\r\nLets assume that connecting is what your method *actually* does. In this case, we name it more aptly `connectToService` and make it throw the exception directly:\r\n\r\n    public void connectToService() thows IOException {\r\n        // yada yada some init stuff, whatever\r\n        socket.connect();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void proceedWhenError() {\r\n       try {\r\n            connectToService();\r\n       } else {\r\n          logger.debug(&quot;Exception happened, but it&#39;s alright.&quot;, exception)\r\n          // do stuff\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void doNotProceedWhenError() throws IllegalStateException {\r\n        try  {\r\n            connectToService();\r\n            // do stuff\r\n        }\r\n        catch(IOException e) {\r\n          throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;Oh, we cannot proceed. The service is not up.&quot;, exception)\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n### Use `boolean`\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it might be possible that your `serviceUp` (which is *still* badly named and would better be called `isServiceUp`) does actually *query* whether the service is running or not (which might have been started by someone else). In this case, using a boolean would be the proper way\r\n\r\n    public boolean isServiceUp {\r\n        return ...; // query the service however you need\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis, of course, refers to the first solution of using booleans and isn&#39;t really helpful when you also need to know *why* the service isn&#39;t up.\r\n\r\n### Use intermediary/result/state objects\r\n\r\nSo lets dismiss this limited approach and rework it using an intermediary/result/state object:\r\n\r\n    class ServiceState {\r\n        enum State { CONNECTED, WAITING, CLOSED; }\r\n        \r\n        State state;\r\n        IOException exception;\r\n        String additionalMessage;\r\n\r\n        public ServiceState (State state, IOException ex, String msg) {\r\n             [...] // ommitted for brevity\r\n        }\r\n\r\n       // getters ommitted for brevity\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe helper function would become `getServiceState`:\r\n\r\n    public ServiceState getServiceState() {\r\n        // query the service state however you need &amp; return\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void proceedWhenError() {\r\n       ServiceState state = getServiceState();\r\n\r\n       if (state.getState() == State.CONNECTED) {\r\n          // do stuff\r\n       } else {\r\n          logger.debug(&quot;Exception happened, but it&#39;s alright.&quot;, state.getException())\r\n          // do stuff\r\n       }\r\n     }\r\n\r\n    public void doNotProceedWhenError() {\r\n        ServiceState state = getServiceState();\r\n\r\n       if (state.getState() == State.CONNECTED) {\r\n          // do stuff\r\n       } else {\r\n          // do stuff\r\n          throw new IllegalStateException(&quot;Oh, we cannot proceed. The service is not up.&quot;, exception)\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote that you are also repeating yourself in `proceedWhenError`, the whole code could be simplified to:\r\n\r\n    public void proceedWhenError() {\r\n       ServiceState state = getServiceState();\r\n\r\n      if (state.getState() != State.CONNECTED) {\r\n          logger.debug(&quot;Exception happened, but it&#39;s alright.&quot;, state.getException())\r\n     \r\n       }\r\n     // do stuff\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThere is a bit of debate when to use the second case, and when to use the third. Some people believe that exceptions should be exceptional and that you should not design with the possibility of exceptions in mind, and will pretty much always use the second option. That is fine. But we have checked exceptions in Java, so I see no reason not to use them. I use checked exceptions \r\n when the basic assumption is that the call should succeed (like using a socket), but failure is possible, and I use the second option when its very unclear whether the call should succeed (like validating data). But there are different opinions on this.\r\n\r\nIt also depends on what your helper method *actually* does. `isServiceUp` implies that it *queries some state*, but doesn&#39;t change it. In that case, returning an state object is obviously the idiomatic way to handle this.\r\n\r\nBut your *implementation* shows that the helper method *connects* to the service. In which case, at least in java, the idiomatic way to handle it would be to throw a (checked) exception - but you could also still justify using a result object.\r\n\r\nSimply returning `boolean` is not advisable, though, since it is too limited. If *all* you need to know *whether* the service is running or not (and aren&#39;t interested in the cause), such a method might *still* be useful, though (and could, behind the scenes, be implemented as helper method that just does `return getServiceState() == State.SUCCESS`).\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n&gt; It is an anti-pattern to use Exceptions to control the workflow\r\n\r\nSo, lets see, what *is* an exception?\r\n\r\n&gt; **Definition:** An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that *disrupts the normal flow* of the program&#39;s instructions.\r\n \r\nSource: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/definition.html\r\n\r\nThe very definition of an exception is that it is an event that *disprupts* (and thus changes) the workflow of the program.

Again, a validation failure of any item causes all the lambdas/Functions/Consumers/Futures/whatever to be discarded and never executed.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":14767494,"reputation":15,"user_id":10665068,"display_name":"yansto"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":73199856,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1659389690,"creation_date":1659387113,"question_id":73199478,"body_markdown":"I am just wondering if there is a better solution to the following problem.\r\nI want to validate all items in a list first, and then store them with additional values in a database.

Thanks in advance!</p>\n<p>Regards,\nRitesh</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","mysql","uniqueidentifier"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":19281,"reputation":30569,"user_id":45066,"accept_rate":76,"display_name":"Yada"},"score":2,"creation_date":1265220670,"post_id":2194206,"comment_id":2143239,"body_markdown":"The easiest unique ID for database is incrementing a number.","body":"The easiest unique ID for database is incrementing a number."},{"owner":{"account_id":261142,"reputation":47118,"user_id":545127,"accept_rate":69,"display_name":"Raedwald"},"score":0,"creation_date":1500539513,"post_id":2194206,"comment_id":77384797,"body_markdown":"Why not use a UUID instead? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/192920/generating-a-globally-unique-identifier-in-java","body":"Why not use a UUID instead? <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/192920/generating-a-globally-unique-identifier-in-java\" title=\"generating a globally unique identifier in java\">stackoverflow.com/questions/192920/&hellip;</a>"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":39106,"reputation":4440,"user_id":112713,"display_name":"Sean"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1265220567,"creation_date":1265220567,"answer_id":2194239,"question_id":2194206,"body_markdown":"    public String getUniqueId(String uniqueString) {\r\n        return uniqueString;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nUnless the ID has any other constraints on it than &quot;be unique&quot;.","title":"Generate unique id from unique string input","body":"<pre><code>public String getUniqueId(String uniqueString) {\n    return uniqueString;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Unless the ID has any other constraints on it than \"be unique\".</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":65544,"reputation":26923,"user_id":192801,"accept_rate":90,"display_name":"FrustratedWithFormsDesigner"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1265220842,"creation_date":1265220842,"answer_id":2194267,"question_id":2194206,"body_markdown":"If your database requires that the column contain unique values, then why not use the string itself?

Using the same values that GLES20 return into glReadPixels works in the same devices and gives a black screen in the same devices; so it seems not to be a configuration problem.</p>\n<p>Doing a random sample of the pixel buffer after flipping the pixels also shows that any random pixel in the black image is actually [0,0,0,255]; it is not transparent, it's actually just reading black.</p>\n<p>Investigation is proceeding in the direction of finding perhaps another buffer where the screen pixels might be instead of the default glReadPixels is reading from. Otherwise... I'm completely lost.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","asynchronous"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":5137145,"reputation":1518,"user_id":4115522,"accept_rate":33,"display_name":"Reenactor Rob"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1422463182,"creation_date":1422463182,"answer_id":28197611,"question_id":28197335,"body_markdown":"When a NoClassDefFoundError occurs during runtime, it means that you didn&#39;t supply a reference to the dependency either when building the final .war/.ear, or in the environment classpath.\r\n\r\nUse winzip or the jar command to look at the files in your archive and see if the needed .jar file is present.\r\n\r\nIf not, put the JAR-file on the classpath or in the export library list of the project in Eclipse.
