using spring annotations your test class should not inherit from `CamelTestSupport` and it should include the `@SpringBootTest` and `@RunWith(CamelSpringBootRunner.class)` annotations you&#39;ve commented out. `CamelSpringBootRunner` should be able to pick up any classes with `@Component` annotation that implement `RouteBuilder` interface for your tests. \r\n\r\n`CamelTestSupport` is generally used for testing camel routes in applications that do not use any of the application frameworks supported by Camel. To use it you&#39;ll need to override at least the `createRouteBuilder` or the `createRouteBuilders` method to return **RouteBuilder(s)** to run tests against. \r\n\r\nAs far as I know the `CamelTestSupport` doesn&#39;t support `@EndpointInject`, `@Autowired` or `@MockEndpoints` spring-annotations so I would advice against mixing the two. \r\n\r\nYour null-pointer exception is probably caused by both `mock` and `template` being null since `@EndpointInject` and `@Autowired` annotations will do nothing with `@SpringBootTest` and `@RunWith(CamelSpringBootRunner.class)` commented out. \r\n\r\n[Edit]\r\n\r\nIn newer Camel versions like Apache camel 3.15.0 you should use annotations `@SpringBootTest` and `@CamelSpringBootTest` for the test class instead. Requred imports are `org.apache.camel.test.spring.junit5.CamelSpringBootTest` and `org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest`.\r\n\r\nAlso make sure that the import for @Test annotation is `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test` and **NOT** `import org.apache.camel.test.junit5.params.Test`.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.camel&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;camel-test-spring-junit5&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## BOM&#39;s (bill of materials)\r\n\r\nInstead of specifying all the versions yourself you should use camel and spring-boot BOM:s instead.

To use it you'll need to override at least the <code>createRouteBuilder</code> or the <code>createRouteBuilders</code> method to return <strong>RouteBuilder(s)</strong> to run tests against.</p>\n<p>As far as I know the <code>CamelTestSupport</code> doesn't support <code>@EndpointInject</code>, <code>@Autowired</code> or <code>@MockEndpoints</code> spring-annotations so I would advice against mixing the two.</p>\n<p>Your null-pointer exception is probably caused by both <code>mock</code> and <code>template</code> being null since <code>@EndpointInject</code> and <code>@Autowired</code> annotations will do nothing with <code>@SpringBootTest</code> and <code>@RunWith(CamelSpringBootRunner.class)</code> commented out.</p>\n<p>[Edit]</p>\n<p>In newer Camel versions like Apache camel 3.15.0 you should use annotations <code>@SpringBootTest</code> and <code>@CamelSpringBootTest</code> for the test class instead.

So the approximate implementatin would be as following:  \r\n\r\n**StringProcessor.java**\r\n```lang-java\r\nclass StringProcessor {\r\n\r\n    public interface StringProcessorListener {\r\n        void onStringProcessingFinish(boolean found);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();\r\n    private StringProcessorListener listener;\r\n\r\n    public StringProcessor(StringProcessorListener listener) {\r\n        this.listener = listener;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void process(InputStream inputStream, String strToFind) {\r\n        executorService.execute(()-&gt; {\r\n            // Do the processing here...\r\n            while(inputStream.availlable() &gt; 0) {\r\n                // Processing... maybe some string building or something else...\r\n                // Processing code goes here...\r\n                // A string built check it out\r\n                if(str.equals(strToFind)) {\r\n                    // The string what we look for is found, notify the listener with true\r\n                    listener.onStringProcessingFinish(true);\r\n                    return;\r\n                }\r\n                // If reached here then the string not found, notify with false\r\n                listener.onStringProcessingFinish(false);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe would make use of this class from a superior class like following:  \r\n\r\n**YourMainOrSuperiorClass.java**\r\n```lang-java\r\nclass YourMainOrSuperiorClass {\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\r\n        // Insantiate or get an input stream from where you wish...\r\n        BufferedInputStream bufferedInputStream = new BufferedInputStream(inputStream);\r\n\r\n        // Search a string using the processor class\r\n        new StringProcessor(new StringProcessorListener {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void onStringProcessingFinish(boolean found) {\r\n                if(found) {\r\n                    // The string has been found, handle it\r\n                }\r\n                else {\r\n                    // The String has not been found, handle it\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n        .process(bufferedInputStream, &quot;String to find&quot;);\r\n\r\n        // Maybe some more stuff to process from here...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, no need to block any thread using async interface patterns. When you invoke the `StringProcessor.process()` method, it will process the string within its internal thread without blocking the main thread, and you don&#39;t have to wait it to finish, on the contrary you can process more code meanwhile.  \r\nIn the meantime, the `StringProcessor` will call the listener&#39;s `onStringProcessingFinish()` method as soon as the result is available and it will handled **asynchronously** from main thread while the main thread is taking care of something else.  \r\n\r\nNote that main thread should not return until the result is delivered in case of you need to update some UI elements or something else in the main thread. If this is the case you can manage it using a boolean flag, when main thread has been executed all of its stuff then enters to a busy waiting using that flag until the result is delivered. Once the result has delivered you can set that boolean flag accordingly then.

So the approximate implementatin would be as following:</p>\n<p><strong>StringProcessor.java</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>class StringProcessor {\n\n    public interface StringProcessorListener {\n        void onStringProcessingFinish(boolean found);\n    }\n\n    private ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();\n    private StringProcessorListener listener;\n\n    public StringProcessor(StringProcessorListener listener) {\n        this.listener = listener;\n    }\n\n    public void process(InputStream inputStream, String strToFind) {\n        executorService.execute(()-&gt; {\n            // Do the processing here...\n            while(inputStream.availlable() &gt; 0) {\n                // Processing... maybe some string building or something else...\n                // Processing code goes here...\n                // A string built check it out\n                if(str.equals(strToFind)) {\n                    // The string what we look for is found, notify the listener with true\n                    listener.onStringProcessingFinish(true);\n                    return;\n                }\n                // If reached here then the string not found, notify with false\n                listener.onStringProcessingFinish(false);\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We would make use of this class from a superior class like following:</p>\n<p><strong>YourMainOrSuperiorClass.java</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>class YourMainOrSuperiorClass {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        // Insantiate or get an input stream from where you wish...\n        BufferedInputStream bufferedInputStream = new BufferedInputStream(inputStream);\n\n        // Search a string using the processor class\n        new StringProcessor(new StringProcessorListener {\n            @Override\n            public void onStringProcessingFinish(boolean found) {\n                if(found) {\n                    // The string has been found, handle it\n                }\n                else {\n                    // The String has not been found, handle it\n                }\n            }\n        })\n        .process(bufferedInputStream, &quot;String to find&quot;);\n\n        // Maybe some more stuff to process from here...\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, no need to block any thread using async interface patterns. When you invoke the <code>StringProcessor.process()</code> method, it will process the string within its internal thread without blocking the main thread, and you don't have to wait it to finish, on the contrary you can process more code meanwhile.<br />\nIn the meantime, the <code>StringProcessor</code> will call the listener's <code>onStringProcessingFinish()</code> method as soon as the result is available and it will handled <strong>asynchronously</strong> from main thread while the main thread is taking care of something else.</p>\n<p>Note that main thread should not return until the result is delivered in case of you need to update some UI elements or something else in the main thread. If this is the case you can manage it using a boolean flag, when main thread has been executed all of its stuff then enters to a busy waiting using that flag until the result is delivered. Once the result has delivered you can set that boolean flag accordingly then.

I have also used an indefinite iteration style</p>\n<pre><code>    public BufferedImage getCardImage(String card)\n    {\n        waitForProcess = true;\n        System.out.println(&quot;ask server for card image&quot;);\n        sendMessage(&quot;get card&quot;);\n        sendMessage(card.replace(&quot;//&quot;, &quot;_&quot;));\n        BufferedImage img = null;\n        while(img == null)\n        {\n            System.out.println(&quot;try getting card image&quot;);\n            try {img = ImageIO.read(new BufferedInputStream(dataInputStream));}\n            catch(IOException ex)\n            {\n                System.out.println(&quot;error getting image from server: &quot; + ex);\n            }\n            count++;\n        }\n        \n        \n        System.out.println(&quot;got card image from server &quot; + img);\n        waitForProcess = false;\n        return img;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>this doesnt hang and has the intended effect, however i dont want the program to keep running indefinitely and would like for it to halt after a maximum number of iterations.</p>\n<p>I realize this code snippet may not be sufficient so below is a link to a github repo with all of the code. this snippet belongs to client.java.</p>\n<p>WARNING: exposure to the rest of the code may cause irritation and an overwhelming sense of confusion.

It states:\r\n\r\n&gt; *&quot;This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of\r\n&gt; this object&#39;s monitor. A thread becomes the owner of the object&#39;s\r\n&gt; monitor in one of three ways:*\r\n&gt; 1. *By executing a `synchronized` instance method of that object.*\r\n&gt; 2. *By executing the body of a `synchronized` statement that synchronizes on the object.*\r\n&gt; 3. *For objects of type `Class`, by executing a `synchronized static` method of that class.&quot;*\r\n\r\nBut your real question is *why* is it necessary?  *Why* did they design it this way?\r\n\r\nTo answer that, we need to understand that Java&#39;s `wait` / `notify` mechanism is *primarily* designed for implementing [*condition variables*][2].  The purpose of a condition variable is to allow one thread to wait for a condition to become true and for another thread to notify it that this has occurred.  The basic pattern for implementing condition variables using `wait()` / `notify()` is as follows:\r\n\r\n    // Shared lock that provides mutual exclusion for &#39;theCondition&#39;.\r\n    final Object lock = new Object();\r\n\r\n    // Thread #1\r\n    synchronized (lock) {\r\n        // ...\r\n        while (! theCondition) {  // One reason for this loop will\r\n                                  // become later ...\r\n            lock.wait();\r\n        }\r\n        // HERE\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Thread # 2\r\n    synchronized (lock) {\r\n        // ...\r\n        if (theCondition) {\r\n            lock.notify();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis when thread #1 reaches `// HERE`, it knows that `theCondition` is now true.  Furthermore it is guaranteed the current values variables that make up the condition, and any others controlled by the `lock` monitor will now be visible to thread #1.\r\n\r\nBut one of the prerequisites for this actually working is that both thread #1 and thread #2 are synchronized on the same monitor.  That will guarantee the visibility of the values according to a *happens before* analysis based on the Java Memory Model (see JLS 17.4).\r\n\r\nA second reason that the above needs synchronization is because thread #1 needs exclusive access to the variables to check the condition and then use them.  Without mutual exclusion for the shared state between threads #1 and #2, race conditions are possible that can lead to a missed notification.\r\n\r\nSince the above only works reliably when threads #1 and #2 hold the monitor when calling `wait` and `notify`, the Java designers decided to *enforce* this in implementations of the `wait` and `notify` methods themselves.  Hence the javadoc that I quoted above.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nNow ... your use-case for `wait()` / `notify()` is simpler.  No information is shared between the two threads ... apart from the fact that the notify occurred.  But it is still necessary to follow the pattern above.  \r\n\r\nConsider the consequences of this caveat in the [javadoc][3] for the `wait()` methods:\r\n\r\n&gt; *&quot;A thread can wake up without being notified, interrupted, or timing out, a so-called &quot;spurious wakeup&quot;. While this will rarely occur in practice, applications must guard against it ...&quot;*\r\n\r\nSo one issue is that a spurious wakeup could cause the child thread to be woken before the main thread&#39;s `sleep(...)` completes.\r\n\r\nA second issue is that is the child thread is delayed, the main thread may `notify` the child before the child has reached the `wait`.  The notification then be lost.  (This might happen due to system load.) \r\n\r\nWhat these issues mean is that your example is **incorrect** ... in theory, if not in reality.  And in fact, it is not possible to solve your problem using wait / notify without following the pattern above/\r\n\r\nA corrected version of your example (i.e. one that is not vulnerable to spurious wakeups, and race conditions) looks like this:\r\n\r\n    final Object lock = new Object;\r\n    boolean wakeUp = false;\r\n    \r\n    Thread thread = new Thread(() -&gt; {\r\n        synchronized (lock){\r\n            try {\r\n                while (!wakeUp) {\r\n                    this.wait();\r\n                }\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Woke&quot;);\r\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n                throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    });\r\n    thread.start();\r\n    TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);\r\n    synchronized (lock) {\r\n        wakeUp = true;\r\n        this.notify();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote that there are simpler and more obviously correct ways to do this using various `java.concurrent.*` classes.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html#notify()\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization)#Condition_variables_2\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html#wait(long,int)\r\n","title":"Why calling notify in Java requires holding the lock?","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>I think the holding the lock is not necessary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is necessary <strong>because</strong> the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html#notify()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">javadoc</a> for <code>Object.notify()</code> says it is necessary.

Now i added the Person folder to the project and moved the `CarApplication.class` one level up because now it has to handle both &#39;car&#39; and &#39;person&#39;. But since doing that I get an error in `PersonController.class`.\r\n\r\nThis is my PersonService.class:\r\n\r\n    package com.example.person.service;\r\n\r\n    import ...\r\n\r\n    public class PersonService {\r\n\r\n        private final PersonDao personDao;\r\n\r\n        public PersonService(@Qualifier(&quot;postgres&quot;) PersonDao personDao) {\r\n             this.personDao = personDao;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public List&lt;Person&gt; getAllPersons() {\r\n            return personDao.selectAllPersons();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public Optional&lt;Person&gt; getPersonById(UUID id) {\r\n            return personDao.selectPersonById(id);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is the `CarApplication.class`:\r\n\r\n    package com.example;\r\n\r\n    import ...\r\n\r\n    @SpringBootApplication\r\n    @EnableScheduling\r\n    @EnableAdminServer\r\n    public class CarApplication {\r\n\r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            SpringApplication.run(CarApplication.class, args);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd last, but not least, this is my `PersonController.class` where the error occurs:\r\n\r\n    package com.example.person.controller;\r\n\r\n    import ...\r\n\r\n    @RequestMapping(&quot;api/person&quot;)\r\n    @RestController\r\n    public class PersonController {\r\n\r\n        private final PersonService personService;\r\n\r\n        @Autowired\r\n        public PersonController(PersonService **personService**) {\r\n            this.personService = personService;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @GetMapping\r\n        public List&lt;Person&gt; getAllPersons() {\r\n            return personService.getAllPersons();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @GetMapping(path = &quot;{id}&quot;)\r\n        public Person getPersonById(@PathVariable(&quot;id&quot;) UUID id) {\r\n            return personService.getPersonById(id)\r\n                    .orElse(null);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI have surrounded the variable that throws the error with &quot;**&quot; in the `PersonController.class`.\r\n\r\nThis is my datasource properties from application.properties:\r\n\r\n    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/persondb\r\n    spring.datasource.username=postgres\r\n    spring.datasource.password=password\r\n\r\nI have tried to use `@ComponentScan` to specify which maps should be scanned for beans, but it doesn&#39;t solve it.
