The separation occurs based upon whether the methods are a command or a query (the same definition that is used by Meyer in Command and Query Separation, a command is any method that mutates state and a query is any method that returns a value). \r\n\r\nTypically, this means that each of the objects will use a different representation of the data, so as to be fit for purpose.  Common language here is to refer to a &quot;write model&quot; and a &quot;read model&quot;.

If it works, you&#39;re on glibc (GNU).  If you get an `UnsatisfiedLinkError` that the function is not found, you&#39;re on some other libc.\r\n\r\nMap the function:\r\n```java\r\npublic interface Libc extends Library {\r\n    Libc INSTANCE = Native.load(&quot;c&quot;, Libc.class);\r\n\r\n    String gnu_get_libc_version();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCall it:\r\n```java\r\npublic class GnuOrMusl {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        try {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;On GNU libc version &quot; + Libc.INSTANCE.gnu_get_libc_version());\r\n        } catch (UnsatisfiedLinkError e) {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Not on glibc!&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote that this detection may indicate glibc if you&#39;re in a containerized environment with glibc compatibility, but that raises the question of which build of your library is appropriate there.\r\n\r\nThere may be similar approaches with a unique function to distinguish other libc variants from MUSL, but as far as I&#39;m aware, MUSL attempts to be so standards-compliant that it doesn&#39;t really allow identifying itself.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nAnother option for finding GNU distributions is the `uname -o` command that you can execute with a ProcessBuilder. \r\n\r\nOn non-GNU (Alpine) it is just &quot;Linux&quot; while on Ubuntu, Debian and OpenSUSE it is &quot;GNU/Linux&quot;.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nYou may also have success determining GNU vs. MUSL by iterating `/lib*` directories looking for libc variants.  This is similar to the approach taken [when compiling the JDK][2], which executes the `ldd` command and parses libraries from that output.\r\n\r\nFor example, iterating the `/lib` directory in Alpine linux gives this link: `libc.musl-x86_64.so.1 -&gt; ld-musl-x86_64.so.1`\r\n\r\nIn Debian `/lib32` has `libc.so.6 -&gt; libc-2.28.so`, and in OpenSUSE `/lib64` I see something similar: `libc.so.6 -&gt; libc-2.26.so`, and Ubuntu `/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu` has `libc-2.27.so`.\r\n\r\nIf you stay within Java, determining which `/lib` path to search may require some trial-and-error. Parsing the output of a command line such as `` ldd `which ls` `` will likely get you a string containing `gnu` or `musl`.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nAs far as determining which Linux Distribution to use, reading from an `/etc` folder is a good intuition.  I manage the Java-based Operating System and Hardware Information (OSHI) project, and went through pretty much all the options to identify which distribution you are running.  You can see the results of all that labor in [this class][3].\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll quote a comment in that file:\r\n\r\n&gt; There are two competing options for family/version information. Newer\r\n&gt; systems are adopting a standard /etc/os-release file:\r\n&gt; https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Some systems are still using the lsb standard which parses a variety\r\n&gt; of /etc/*-release files and is most easily accessed via the\r\n&gt; commandline lsb_release -a, see here:\r\n&gt; https://linux.die.net/man/1/lsb_release In this case, the\r\n&gt; /etc/lsb-release file (if it exists) has optional overrides to the\r\n&gt; information in the /etc/distrib-release files, which show:\r\n&gt; &quot;Distributor release x.x (Codename)&quot;\r\n\r\nThe code&#39;s logic goes:\r\n\r\n1. Attempt `/etc/system-release`\r\n2. Attempt `/etc/os-release`\r\n3. Run `lsb_release` command\r\n4. Read `/etc/lsb-release` \r\n5. Look for and read any `/etc/*-release` file.\r\n\r\nThose files contain keys like `NAME` that help you out.\r\n\r\nFeel free to copy and use that file or a variant, or just use that project as a dependency.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/gnu_get_libc_release.3.html\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/e92e2fd4e0bc805d8f7d70f632cce0282eb1809b/make/autoconf/build-aux/config.guess\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/oshi/oshi/blob/edbc60f4456307b9efa217fed6b7d6a6794bb4b2/oshi-core/src/main/java/oshi/software/os/linux/LinuxOperatingSystem.java","title":"Decide GNU or MUSL build of linux in Java","body":"<p>Using Java/JNA, you can map the <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/gnu_get_libc_release.3.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>gnu_get_libc_version()</code></a> function and attempt to execute it after loading <code>libc</code>.

This is similar to the approach taken <a href=\"https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/e92e2fd4e0bc805d8f7d70f632cce0282eb1809b/make/autoconf/build-aux/config.guess\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">when compiling the JDK</a>, which executes the <code>ldd</code> command and parses libraries from that output.</p>\n<p>For example, iterating the <code>/lib</code> directory in Alpine linux gives this link: <code>libc.musl-x86_64.so.1 -&gt; ld-musl-x86_64.so.1</code></p>\n<p>In Debian <code>/lib32</code> has <code>libc.so.6 -&gt; libc-2.28.so</code>, and in OpenSUSE <code>/lib64</code> I see something similar: <code>libc.so.6 -&gt; libc-2.26.so</code>, and Ubuntu <code>/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu</code> has <code>libc-2.27.so</code>.</p>\n<p>If you stay within Java, determining which <code>/lib</code> path to search may require some trial-and-error. Parsing the output of a command line such as <code>ldd `which ls`</code> will likely get you a string containing <code>gnu</code> or <code>musl</code>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As far as determining which Linux Distribution to use, reading from an <code>/etc</code> folder is a good intuition.  I manage the Java-based Operating System and Hardware Information (OSHI) project, and went through pretty much all the options to identify which distribution you are running.  You can see the results of all that labor in <a href=\"https://github.com/oshi/oshi/blob/edbc60f4456307b9efa217fed6b7d6a6794bb4b2/oshi-core/src/main/java/oshi/software/os/linux/LinuxOperatingSystem.java\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this class</a>.</p>\n<p>I'll quote a comment in that file:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are two competing options for family/version information.

Let&#39;s say we edit the first row and it should be filtered now. Then the rest of the rows should be shifted up one row to top but it turns out they are not: only the first row will be correctly repainted to show the second row but the rest of the table still the same.

According to [RowSorter API][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt; Concrete implementations of `RowSorter` need to reference a model such\r\n&gt; as `TableModel` or `ListModel`. The view classes, such as `JTable` and\r\n&gt; `JList`, will also have a reference to the model. To avoid ordering\r\n&gt; dependencies, `RowSorter` implementations should not install a listener\r\n&gt; on the model. Instead the view class will call into the `RowSorter` when\r\n&gt; the model changes. For example, if a row is updated in a `TableModel`\r\n&gt; `JTable` invokes `rowsUpdated`. When the model changes, the view may call\r\n&gt; into any of the following methods: `modelStructureChanged`,\r\n&gt; `allRowsChanged`, `rowsInserted`, `rowsDeleted` and `rowsUpdated`.\r\n\r\nSo as I understand this paragraph, a cell update is a particular case of row update and as such `rowsUpdated` should be called and row filtered accordingly.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate what I&#39;m saying, please consider this simple filter:\r\n\r\n    private void applyFilter() {\r\n        DefaultRowSorter sorter = (DefaultRowSorter)table.getRowSorter();\r\n        sorter.setRowFilter(new RowFilter() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public boolean include(RowFilter.Entry entry) {\r\n                Boolean value = (Boolean)entry.getValue(2);\r\n                return value == null || value;\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere the third column is expected to be a `Boolean` and `entry` (row) has to be included if the cell value is either `null` or `true`. If I edit a cell placed at third column and set its value to `false` then I&#39;d expect this row just &quot;disappear&quot; from the view. However, to accomplish this I have to set a new filter again because it doesn&#39;t seem to work &quot;automatically&quot;.\r\n\r\nAttaching a `TableModelListener` to the model as follows, I can see the update event on cell edits:\r\n\r\n    model.addTableModelListener(new TableModelListener() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void tableChanged(TableModelEvent e) {\r\n            if (e.getType() == TableModelEvent.UPDATE) {\r\n                int row = e.getLastRow();\r\n                int column = e.getColumn();\r\n                Object value = ((TableModel)e.getSource()).getValueAt(row, column);\r\n                \r\n                String text = String.format(&quot;Update event. Row: %1s Column: %2s Value: %3s&quot;, row, column, value);\r\n                System.out.println(text);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\nAs I&#39;ve said, if I reset the filter using this `TableModelListener` then it works as expected:\r\n\r\n     model.addTableModelListener(new TableModelListener() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void tableChanged(TableModelEvent e) {\r\n            if (e.getType() == TableModelEvent.UPDATE) {\r\n                applyFilter();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\n**Question:** is this a bug/implementation issue?

To build a `jar`, [by default](http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.3.9/maven-core/default-bindings.html#Plugin_bindings_for_jar_packaging) invoke the `maven-jar-plugin`; to build a `war`, [by default](http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.3.9/maven-core/default-bindings.html#Plugin_bindings_for_war_packaging) invoke the `maven-war-plugin` and so on.

Since Maven **3.0.3** ([`MNG-2258`](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-2258)), different plugin executions attached to the same Maven phase will be invoked in their order of declaration in the `pom.xml` file. That is, **ordering is important** in this case, since it may affect the behavior of the build.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, also order of `dependency` declarations may affect your build towards [Dependency Mediation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html), that is, the first declared dependency wins in case of conflict against a transitive dependency. So, once again, **ordering is important in certain cases**.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, although ordering is not important for other sections of the `pom.xml` file, good habit is to follow official [Maven recommendations](https://maven.apache.org/developers/conventions/code.html) and, as a simplified version, follow this order of declaration:\r\n\r\n    &lt;project&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;modelVersion/&gt;\r\n\t \r\n\t  &lt;parent/&gt;\r\n\t \r\n\t  &lt;groupId/&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;artifactId/&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;version/&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;packaging/&gt;\r\n\t \r\n\t  &lt;properties/&gt;\r\n\t \r\n\t  &lt;dependencyManagement/&gt;\r\n\t  &lt;dependencies/&gt;\r\n\t \r\n\t  &lt;build/&gt;\r\n\t \r\n\t  &lt;reporting/&gt;\r\n\t \r\n\t  &lt;profiles/&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/project&gt;\r\n\r\nThe [`sortpom-maven-plugin`](https://github.com/Ekryd/sortpom) can also be used to automatically apply this standard ordering, simply invoking the following on the concerned `pom.xml` file:\r\n\r\n    mvn com.github.ekryd.sortpom:sortpom-maven-plugin:2.5.0:sort \\\r\n         -Dsort.keepBlankLines -Dsort.predefinedSortOrder=recommended_2008_06 \r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n**For further reading**:\r\n\r\n - [Stack Overflow: Maven: what is pluginManagement?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10483180/maven-what-is-pluginmanagement)\r\n - [Official Maven doc: Maven POM Reference, PluginManagement](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Plugin_Management)\r\n - [Official Maven default bindings](http://maven.apache.org/ref/3.3.9/maven-core/default-bindings.html)\r\n - [Official Maven doc: Dependency Mediation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html)\r\n - [Official Maven doc: Maven Code Style And Code Conventions](https://maven.apache.org/developers/conventions/code.html)\r\n","title":"Plugins in Maven and POM.xml","body":"<p><strong>A late clarification on two important points</strong>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Where to place <code>plugin</code></strong><br>\nA <code>plugin</code> should indeed be added in most of the cases within the <code>build</code>/<code>plugins</code> section, however there is <strong>an important difference</strong> between placing it within <code>plugins</code> against placing it within <code>pluginManagement</code>/<code>plugins</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This misunderstanding is <strong>often</strong> the cause of a non invoked plugin in Maven or an harder troubleshooting:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Plugins under <code>build</code>/<code>plugins</code> are directly part of the default Maven build, if they specify an <code>execution</code> or if they configure something for the default build (see below)</li>\n<li><p>Plugins under <code>build</code>/<code>pluginManagement</code>/<code>plugins</code> are not necessarely part of the default Maven build, that is, is a management, it's an hint to maven: it you happen to use this plugin, then please use the version, the configuration, the executions I specify here, in this management.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>But what <em>happen to use</em> means?</strong> Means: if the same plugin is <strong>also</strong> present in the <code>build</code>/<code>plugins</code> section, then apply this management (and only then it will be effective); <strong>or</strong> if the plugin is invoked by default by Maven, then also apply it.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>But how is a plugin invoked by default?</strong> That's part of the main philosophy behind maven: convention over configuration.

Another example is the safepoint polling mechanism, which protects a page in memory when a safepoint is required. Any thread that accesses that page causes a `SIGSEGV`, which results in the execution of a stub that brings the thread to a safepoint.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; * Unexpected signals. That includes a `SIGSEGV` when executing in VM code, Java Native Interface (JNI) code, or native code. In these cases, the signal is unexpected, so fatal error handling is invoked to create the error log and terminate the process.\r\n\r\nThat approach allows the JVM to optimize performance by reducing the overhead of explicit null checks in the code, relying instead on the operating system&#39;s memory protection mechanisms to detect access to null references. When such access occurs, the operating system generates a `SIGSEGV` signal, which the JVM then interprets as an attempt to dereference a null pointer, leading to the throwing of a `NullPointerException`.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is important to note that this is an *internal* mechanism of the JVM and is distinct from externally generated `SIGSEGV` signals, such as those sent using the `kill` command. External `SIGSEGV` signals are generally used to indicate serious errors, including invalid memory access, and are more likely to result in a JVM crash or core dump rather than a `NullPointerException`.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n+---------------------+         +-----------------------------------+\r\n| External Process    |         | Java Process running on HotSpot   |\r\n| sending SIGSEGV     | ------&gt; | JVM                               |\r\n| (kill -11)          |         | Likely JVM Crash or Core Dump     |\r\n+---------------------+         +-----------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n&gt; Is the JVM always capable of detecting whether an external `SIGSEGV` is an external `SIGSEGV` or is it possible to confuse an external `SIGSEGV` for a null access when it happens at a specific time, i.e. when a potential null access is expected?\r\n\r\nAgain, it should not, but this is an *implementation*-specific aspect of JVM behavior.  \r\nThat means the likelihood of such confusion happening in practice may vary depending on the JVM version, the specific code being executed, and the state of the JVM at the time of the signal. \r\n\r\nSee for instance &quot;[How does the JVM know when to throw a NullPointerException](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36955888/6309)&quot;\r\n\r\n&gt; The JVM could implement the null check using virtual memory hardware. The JVM arranges that page zero in its virtual address space is mapped to a page that is unreadable + unwriteable. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Since null is represented as zero, when Java code tries to dereference null this will try to access a non-addressible page and will lead to the OS delivering a &quot;segfault&quot; signal to the JVM. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; The JVM&#39;s segfault signal handler could trap this, figure out where the code was executing, and create and throw an NPE on the stack of the appropriate thread.\r\n\r\nIn that scenario, it should be easy to distinguish a trapped signal from within the code execution, from a received signal from the OS.\r\n\r\nAlso: &quot;[Can a `SIGSEGV` in Java not crash the JVM?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43346525/6309)&quot;\r\n\r\n&gt; There are definitely scenarios where the JVM&#39;s `SIGSEGV` signal handler may turn the `SIGSEGV` event into a Java exception.  \r\nYou will only get a JVM hard crash if that cannot happen; e.g. if the thread that triggered the `SIGSEGV` was executing code in a native library when the event happened.\r\n\r\n[For instance](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44501096/avoid-nullpointerexception-on-jni-vm-startup#comment76037746_44501096): \r\n\r\n&gt; [HotSpot JVM deliberately generates SIGSEGV at startup](https://hg.openjdk.org/jdk8u/jdk8u/hotspot/file/68758c5ab0c1/src/cpu/x86/vm/vm_version_x86.cpp#l259) to check certain CPU features. There is no switch to turn it off.

This behavior is platform-dependent and difficult to reproduce, however, I managed to trigger this in practice.\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n\r\nHotSpot JVM employs a technique called [&quot;implicit null check&quot;](https://shipilev.net/jvm/anatomy-quarks/25-implicit-null-checks/), where the JVM compiles an access to an object field which offset is less than a page size (4096) to a single load/store instruction without extra overhead for checking the object reference for `null`. If such an instruction is executed for `null` reference, the OS raises `SIGSEGV`. The JVM&#39;s signal handler catches this signal and transfers control to the code that throws `NullPointerException`.\r\n\r\nNot every `SIGSEGV` ends up with a NPE. [HotSpot signal handler](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/e47cf611c9490225e50a548787cbba66ab147058/src/hotspot/os_cpu/linux_x86/os_linux_x86.cpp#L207) checks that\r\n - the current thread is a Java thread;\r\n - SIGSEGV occurs in a JIT-compiled code;\r\n - the address being accessed is within zero page (0x0 - 0xfff);\r\n - the fault instruction is marked as &quot;implicit exception&quot; and there is an exception handler assigned to this instruction.\r\n\r\nIn theory, if we craft a signal that satisfies all the conditions, HotSpot will treat it as NPE.\r\n\r\n#### Practice\r\n\r\nTo increase chances of a user signal hitting the right instruction, we&#39;ll write an infinite loop that repeatedly stores to an object field. To prevent hoisting of the null check, the reference itself should be loaded from a volatile field.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class BogusNPE {\r\n    static volatile BogusNPE X = new BogusNPE();\r\n\r\n    int n;\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        while (true) {\r\n            BogusNPE x0 = X, x1 = X, x2 = X, x3 = X, x4 = X, x5 = X, x6 = X, x7 = X, x8 = X, x9 = X;\r\n            x0.n = x1.n = x2.n = x3.n = x4.n = x5.n = x6.n = x7.n = x8.n = x9.n = 0;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere I generated 10 stores in a row, all with an implicit null check.\r\n\r\nUse `-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+PrintAssembly` to verify that the corresponding `mov` instructions are annotated with `implicit exception`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  0x00007fb4a4bd440c:   mov    0x70(%r10),%edx              ;*getstatic X {reexecute=0 rethrow=0 return_oop=0}\r\n                                                            ; - BogusNPE::main@32 (line 8)\r\n  0x00007fb4a4bd4410:   mov    0x70(%r10),%ebp              ;*getstatic X {reexecute=0 rethrow=0 return_oop=0}\r\n                                                            ; - BogusNPE::main@37 (line 8)\r\n  0x00007fb4a4bd4414:   mov    0x70(%r10),%eax              ;*getstatic X {reexecute=0 rethrow=0 return_oop=0}\r\n                                                            ; - BogusNPE::main@42 (line 8)\r\n  0x00007fb4a4bd4418:   mov    %r12d,0xc(%r12,%rax,8)       ; implicit exception: dispatches to 0x00007fb4a4bd4456\r\n                                                            ;*putfield n {reexecute=0 rethrow=0 return_oop=0}\r\n                                                            ; - BogusNPE::main@66 (line 9)\r\n  0x00007fb4a4bd441d:   mov    %r12d,0xc(%r12,%rbp,8)       ; implicit exception: dispatches to 0x00007fb4a4bd4468\r\n                                                            ;*putfield n {reexecute=0 rethrow=0 return_oop=0}\r\n                                                            ; - BogusNPE::main@70 (line 9)\r\n  0x00007fb4a4bd4422:   mov    %r12d,0xc(%r12,%rdx,8)       ; implicit exception: dispatches to 0x00007fb4a4bd447c\r\n                                                            ;*putfield n {reexecute=0 rethrow=0 return_oop=0}\r\n                                                            ; - BogusNPE::main@74 (line 9)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the program and get its PID:\r\n```\r\n$ jps\r\n256 BogusNPE\r\n280 Jps\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere pid=256, but we should send the signal not to a process, but to the particular thread. ID of the main thread is usually pid+1, that is 257.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo kill -11 257\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt may take several attempts before we finally achieve the goal:\r\n```\r\nException in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot assign field &quot;n&quot; because &quot;x5&quot; is null\r\n        at BogusNPE.main(BogusNPE.java:9)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Nuances\r\n\r\nOn x86 platform, I could trigger NPE without `sudo`, but on 64-bit platforms `sudo` is important. Also, it&#39;s substantial that PID of the shell where we run `kill` is less than 4096. And that is why.\r\n\r\nHotSpot [checks](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/e47cf611c9490225e50a548787cbba66ab147058/src/hotspot/os_cpu/linux_x86/os_linux_x86.cpp#L311C9-L312) that the fault address `siginfo-&gt;si_addr` is located in zero page (otherwise load/store instruction requires an explicit null check). However, `si_addr` is set only when SIGSEGV is raised by kernel, we cannot control it with `kill` command.

This behavior is platform-dependent and difficult to reproduce, however, I managed to trigger this in practice.</p>\n<h4>Background</h4>\n<p>HotSpot JVM employs a technique called <a href=\"https://shipilev.net/jvm/anatomy-quarks/25-implicit-null-checks/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">&quot;implicit null check&quot;</a>, where the JVM compiles an access to an object field which offset is less than a page size (4096) to a single load/store instruction without extra overhead for checking the object reference for <code>null</code>. If such an instruction is executed for <code>null</code> reference, the OS raises <code>SIGSEGV</code>. The JVM's signal handler catches this signal and transfers control to the code that throws <code>NullPointerException</code>.</p>\n<p>Not every <code>SIGSEGV</code> ends up with a NPE. <a href=\"https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/e47cf611c9490225e50a548787cbba66ab147058/src/hotspot/os_cpu/linux_x86/os_linux_x86.cpp#L207\" rel=\"noreferrer\">HotSpot signal handler</a> checks that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the current thread is a Java thread;</li>\n<li>SIGSEGV occurs in a JIT-compiled code;</li>\n<li>the address being accessed is within zero page (0x0 - 0xfff);</li>\n<li>the fault instruction is marked as &quot;implicit exception&quot; and there is an exception handler assigned to this instruction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In theory, if we craft a signal that satisfies all the conditions, HotSpot will treat it as NPE.</p>\n<h4>Practice</h4>\n<p>To increase chances of a user signal hitting the right instruction, we'll write an infinite loop that repeatedly stores to an object field.

I've got approx. 10 breakpoints in my opening page, all in JSP/Java code.</p>\n<p>I'm running Java 1.6.0_32 and Java SE Runtime Environment build 1.6.0_32-b05.  I really don't know how to check which JDK I've got loaded.  I've seen recommendations to &quot;go back&quot; to JDK 1.5, but I can't be certain that's not what I'm running.</p>\n<p>And to cover a few other bases, I have JUST started my system for the day, opened the IDE, started the server in debug (says &quot;Debugging, Synchronized&quot;), put focus on the opening page of the application and clicked &quot;Debug on server&quot;.  The front page opens without stopping at any of the breakpoints.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have ideas or suggestions?</p>\n<p>EDIT: As noted below, I never got this resolved.  I just went on to use another tool (Jetty) to do my debugging.  There are a few very good suggestions here so they are worth reading if you encounter an issue of this type.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","spring-boot","heroku"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":38920,"reputation":9506,"user_id":112041,"accept_rate":92,"display_name":"Malax"},"score":0,"creation_date":1582654958,"post_id":60391822,"comment_id":106849685,"body_markdown":"Your logs will probably contain an exception with a stack trace that will help debugging your problem.
