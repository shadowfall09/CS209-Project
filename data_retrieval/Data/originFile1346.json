concatenation&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nIn order to be on the same page, let&#39;s recap how string concatenation works.\r\n\r\nWhen at least one of the operands in the expression with plus sign `+` is an instance of `String`, plus sign will be interpreted a [string concatenation operator](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.18.1). And the result of the execution of the expression will be a new string created by appending the right operand (*or its string representation*) to the left operand (*or its string representation*).\r\n```\r\nString str = &quot;allow&quot;;\r\nchar ch = &#39;h&#39;;\r\nObject obj = new Object();\r\n    \r\nSystem.out.println(ch + str);      // prints &quot;hallow&quot;\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;test &quot; + obj); // prints &quot;test java.lang.Object@16b98e56&quot;\r\n```\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Explanation of the code-logic&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nThat said, I guess you will agree that this statement concatenates a character at position `i` in the `str` to the resulting string and assigns the result of concatenation to the same variable `result`:\r\n```\r\nresult = result + str.charAt(i);\r\n```\r\nThe condition in the code provided by *coding bat* ensures whether the index `i+2` is valid and then checks characters at indices `i` and `i+2`. If they are equal to `y` and `k` respectively. If that is not the case, the character will be appended to the resulting string. Athowise it will be discarded and the indexed gets incremented by `2` in order to skip the whole group of characters that constitute `&quot;yak&quot;` (with `a` which can be an arbitrary symbol).\r\n\r\nSo the resulting string is being constructed in the loop character by characters.\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Flavors of substring()&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nMethod `substring()` is overload, there are two flavors of it.\r\n\r\nA version that expects two argument: the starting index inclusive, the ending index, exclusive[`substring(int, int)`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#substring(int,int)).\r\n\r\nAnd you can use it to achieve the same result:\r\n```\r\n// an equivalent of result = result + str.charAt(i);\r\n\r\nresult = result + str.substring(i, i + 1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother version of this method, that expects one argument will not be useful here. Because the result returned by `str.substring(i)` will be not a string containing a single character, but a substring staring from the given index, i.e. encompassing all the characters until the end of the string as documentation of [`substring(int)`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#substring(int)) states:\r\n\r\n&gt; public String substring(int beginIndex)\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Returns a string that is a substring of this string.

However, since there is already a line terminator (the second line terminator left from the previous read), once you enter your second input, your scanner immediately halts at the beginning and returns an empty <code>String</code>. After that, the same thing keeps happening where only one read out of two seems to be taken.</p>\n<p>What you need to do is to place an extra <code>nextLine()</code> <b>between every read (not after every read)</b> to get rid of that &quot;extra&quot; line terminator character.</p>\n<pre><code>Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\nString str = &quot;&quot;;\nList&lt;String&gt; strs = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Enter three numbers: &quot;);\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n    str = scanner.nextLine();\n    // The last iteration does not need to get rid of that &quot;extra&quot; line terminator\n    // because there is no following read; \n    // otherwise you would be forced to input an extra number\n    if (i &lt; 2) {\n        scanner.nextLine();\n    }\n    strs.add(str);\n}\nSystem.out.println(strs);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively, you can ask for the input with a print message before every read. In this way, the <code>Scanner</code>'s internal cursor will be moved forward the &quot;extra&quot; line separator due to the text written on screen and allowing you to retrieve the correct input with a single <code>nextLine()</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\nString str = &quot;&quot;;\nList&lt;String&gt; strs = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n    System.out.print(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;);\n    str = scanner.nextLine();\n    strs.add(str);\n}\nSystem.out.println(strs);\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":25297102,"reputation":11,"user_id":19122056,"display_name":"seokh1213"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":239,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":72250930,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1652639742,"creation_date":1652633808,"question_id":72250364,"body_markdown":"# Code\r\n```java\r\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\nimport java.util.Scanner;\r\n\r\npublic class MainT {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n        String str=&quot;&quot;;\r\n        List&lt;String&gt; strs = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n        for(int i= 0; i&lt;3;i++) {\r\n            str = scanner.nextLine();\r\n            strs.add(str);\r\n        }\r\n        System.out.println(strs);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Console\r\n```\r\n1        // input\r\n2        // input\r\n[1, , 2]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI want to input three times.

Does anyone have a suggestion as on how to solve this problem?</p>\n<p>===========================================================</p>\n<p>Update:</p>\n<p>I managed to solve this issue with the first answer given to <a href=\"https://at%20com.company.example.entity.Client.toString\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> question. It says: Remove the <code>@Data</code> annotation and replace it with <code>@Getter</code> and <code>@Setter</code>.</p>\n<p>While I am so grateful for this answer, I don't understand it: I am not actively calling the <code>toString()</code> method. Now, if it is called, is this related to Angular's HttpClient? Because I didn't have this problem with fetch().</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","testing","mockmvc"],"owner":{"account_id":13039091,"reputation":31,"user_id":9423027,"display_name":"jonimv"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":880,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1652637093,"creation_date":1652637093,"question_id":72250821,"body_markdown":"I am studying an old MOOC web development course (as this is an old one, I don&#39;t get any credits from it but I do it anyway to learn something new so I don&#39;t think it is &quot;cheating&quot;).
