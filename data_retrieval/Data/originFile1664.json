Went to `\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\AndroidStudio2020.3`and Deleted all the contents in my folder\r\n 4. Added `disable.android.first.run=true` to my idea.properties\r\n 5. Open Android Studio Offline\r\n 6. Deleted `.Android`, `.Gradle`, `.m2` from my Users Folder\r\n 7. Reinstall the Older version, Android Studio Arctic Fox 2020.3.1.22 but the problem persists\r\n 8. Did all the above steps in my C Drive, deleted everything first, did a fresh install, the problem persists\r\n\r\nIt is at this point, that I think that my only solution is to download android studio using a VM and run it on my computer. However, I would like to avoid using this solution, as you know, Android Studio requires a lot of processing power, and I think my computer is more likely to crash before I can even develop an application.\r\n\r\nI need to use the android studio as it is compulsory for my school work in my university.\r\n\r\nNote: I am unable to replicate the initial process of choosing where to download the SDK file for the android studio (After Deleting Everything stated in the above steps), if anyone could provide me advice on that, I would be extremely thankful.\r\n\r\nTLDR: I was initially able to launch android studio, but after changing the directory for my emulator, I am now unable to open it.

file.</p>\n<p>The steps that I have taken are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Delete my SDK Installation Directory</li>\n<li>Went to `\\AppData\\Roaming\\Google\\AndroidStudio2020.3' and Deleted all the contents in my folder</li>\n<li>Went to <code>\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\AndroidStudio2020.3</code>and Deleted all the contents in my folder</li>\n<li>Added <code>disable.android.first.run=true</code> to my idea.properties</li>\n<li>Open Android Studio Offline</li>\n<li>Deleted <code>.Android</code>, <code>.Gradle</code>, <code>.m2</code> from my Users Folder</li>\n<li>Reinstall the Older version, Android Studio Arctic Fox 2020.3.1.22 but the problem persists</li>\n<li>Did all the above steps in my C Drive, deleted everything first, did a fresh install, the problem persists</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is at this point, that I think that my only solution is to download android studio using a VM and run it on my computer. However, I would like to avoid using this solution, as you know, Android Studio requires a lot of processing power, and I think my computer is more likely to crash before I can even develop an application.</p>\n<p>I need to use the android studio as it is compulsory for my school work in my university.</p>\n<p>Note: I am unable to replicate the initial process of choosing where to download the SDK file for the android studio (After Deleting Everything stated in the above steps), if anyone could provide me advice on that, I would be extremely thankful.</p>\n<p>TLDR: I was initially able to launch android studio, but after changing the directory for my emulator, I am now unable to open it. The log File is provided above. I have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times, and I can't launch the IDE.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","reactive-programming","project-reactor","spring-reactor"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":17800912,"reputation":354,"user_id":13469715,"display_name":"Patrick Magee"},"score":0,"creation_date":1590079063,"post_id":61938744,"comment_id":109550694,"body_markdown":"There are a few ways to limit the total number of results returned by a Flux.

All discovered prime numbers will be added to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n**primes** list acts as cash. There&#39;s no need to rediscover primes over and over again like it&#39;s dome in the first solution. That drastically improves the performance.\r\n\r\nAnother optimization is the way to determine the next probable prime implemented in the method **getNextCandidate()**.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical logic behind this method is based on the fact that all numbers, that are evenly divisible by 2 and 3 are already eliminated because 2 and 3, are added to the **primes** list by default and there is no need to consider any number that is divisible **2** or **3**. From this fact we can make a conclusion that the remainder of division by **6** for every potential prime *cant be equal: 0; 2; 3; 4*.

I am using socket class with two different threads to achieve this i.e. one thread to handle one type of message. Since received messages/packets at sockets can come at any thread it is getting difficult to synchronize and achieve the necessary task. \r\n\r\nThere are two types of byte data that needs to be send to the PLC socket i.e. ByteFrame1 and ByteFrame2. After sending the packets different responses are received.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing code snippet shows Thread 1. \r\n\r\n```\r\nThread workerThread1 = new Thread() {\r\n      @Override\r\n      public void run() {\r\n      try {\r\n            dos = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\r\n            while (socket.isConnected()) {\r\n                dos.write(ByteFrame1);\r\n                 try {\r\n                       DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());\r\n                       readLength = dis.read(OutputBytes1, 0, receiveBufferSize1);\r\n                       //Interpret OutputBytes1 code follows\r\n```\r\n Similarly code snippet for second thread is as follows: \r\n\r\n```\r\n Thread workerThread2 = new Thread() {\r\n      @Override\r\n      public void run() {\r\n       try {\r\n           dos = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());\r\n            while (socket.isConnected()) {\r\n                dos.write(ByteFrame2);\r\n                 try {\r\n                       DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());\r\n                       readLength = dis.read(OutputBytes2, 0, receiveBufferSize2);\r\n                       //Interpret OutputBytes2 code follows\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found that both threads are receiving some garbled data that is difficult to interpret.

Sadly, YAML currently does not provide a standard way of defining a schema. Therefore, you define the schema by writing the class hierarchy your YAML should be deserialised into.</p>\n\n<p>So, in contrary to what you may think, writing the POJOs is not a superfluous action that could be automated, but instead is a vital step for including YAML in your application.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the case that you actually want to use YAML to define some data layout and then generate Java source code from it, that is of course possible. However, you'd need to be much more precise in your description to get help on that.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":17485446,"reputation":71,"user_id":12678589,"display_name":"saquib-khan"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1642709204,"creation_date":1594852687,"answer_id":62924782,"question_id":47907590,"body_markdown":"As pointed out in the comments by [Jack Flamp][1], you can use an online tool ([jsonschema2pojo][2]) to convert a sample yaml file to its equivalent POJO classes.
