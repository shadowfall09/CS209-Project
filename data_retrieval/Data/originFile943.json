It’s a fundamental design problem. The right solution would be an API that allows to create a list of users in one call, instead of requiring one request per user.

Anyway, that's not useful for me, because I have to listen from a topic and send to a topic new each time ( referenced by an String identifier ex: .. 12Erw45-2345Saf-234DASDFasd )</p>\n\n<p>Looking for LEADER_NOT_AVAILABLE in google , some guys talk about adding to server.properties the next lines : </p>\n\n<pre><code>host.name=127.0.0.1\nadvertised.port=9092\nadvertised.host.name=127.0.0.1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But it's not working for me ( Don't know why ) . </p>\n\n<p>I have tried to create the topic before all this process with the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code> private void createTopic(String idTopic) {\n    String zookeeperConnect = \"localhost:2181\";\n    ZkClient zkClient = new ZkClient(zookeeperConnect,10000,10000, \n    ZKStringSerializer$.MODULE$);\n    ZkUtils zkUtils = new ZkUtils(zkClient, new \n    ZkConnection(zookeeperConnect),false);\n    if(!AdminUtils.topicExists(zkUtils,idTopic)) {\n        AdminUtils.createTopic(zkUtils, idTopic, 2, 1, new Properties(), \n    null);\n        logger.debug(\"Created topic \"+idTopic+\" by super user\");\n    }\n    else{\n        logger.debug(\"topic \"+idTopic+\" already exists\");\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>No error, but still, it stays listening till the timeout. </p>\n\n<p>I have reviewed the properties of the broker to check if there's any help, but I haven't found anything clear enough . The props that I have used for reading are : </p>\n\n<pre><code>    props = new Properties();\n    props.put(\"bootstrap.servers\", kafkaConfig.getBootstrap_servers());\n    props.put(\"key.deserializer\", kafkaConfig.getKey_deserializer());\n    props.put(\"value.deserializer\", kafkaConfig.getValue_deserializer());\n    props.put(\"key.serializer\", kafkaConfig.getKey_serializer());\n    props.put(\"value.serializer\", kafkaConfig.getValue_serializer());\n    props.put(\"group.id\",kafkaConfig.getGroupId());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and , for sending ...</p>\n\n<pre><code>   Properties props = new Properties();\n    props.put(\"bootstrap.servers\", kafkaConfig.getHost() + \":\" + \n    kafkaConfig.getPort());\n    props.put(\"group.id\", kafkaConfig.getGroup_id());\n    props.put(\"enable.auto.commit\", kafkaConfig.getEnable_auto_commit());\n    props.put(\"auto.commit.interval.ms\", \n    kafkaConfig.getAuto_commit_interval_ms());\n    props.put(\"session.timeout.ms\", kafkaConfig.getSession_timeout_ms());\n    props.put(\"key.deserializer\", kafkaConfig.getKey_deserializer());\n    props.put(\"value.deserializer\", kafkaConfig.getValue_deserializer());\n    props.put(\"key.serializer\", kafkaConfig.getKey_serializer());\n    props.put(\"value.serializer\", kafkaConfig.getValue_serializer());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any clue ? Why , the only way that I have to consume messages from the broker and from the topic, is repeating the request after an error ?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","netty"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":9850021,"reputation":411,"user_id":7296372,"display_name":"mrkachariker"},"score":0,"creation_date":1666347357,"post_id":74151782,"comment_id":130920780,"body_markdown":"What libraries are you using in the provided code? i.e what is ByteBuf, etc","body":"What libraries are you using in the provided code? i.e what is ByteBuf, etc"},{"owner":{"account_id":4777529,"reputation":110,"user_id":3860235,"display_name":"Alexander Popov"},"score":0,"creation_date":1666348329,"post_id":74151782,"comment_id":130921091,"body_markdown":"@mrkachariker Netty 4.1.82.Final","body":"@mrkachariker Netty 4.1.82.Final"},{"owner":{"account_id":9850021,"reputation":411,"user_id":7296372,"display_name":"mrkachariker"},"score":0,"creation_date":1666359201,"post_id":74151782,"comment_id":130924817,"body_markdown":"Are you sure that the prefix in the case that its not equal to PING, is not equal to `null`?","body":"Are you sure that the prefix in the case that its not equal to PING, is not equal to <code>null</code>?"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4777529,"reputation":110,"user_id":3860235,"display_name":"Alexander Popov"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1666361486,"creation_date":1666361486,"answer_id":74154957,"question_id":74151782,"body_markdown":"Found the solution by myself.

Ty\r\n\r\nTo remove all entries housed in the array, you need to loop the array element by element, and for each element you need to compare that element with each element in the LinkedBag. If that element matches anything in the LinkedBag chain of bags, then you break that reference by making the previous node point to the later node. This diagram should help you visualize the deletion process:\r\n\r\n    linkedBag (firstNode) -&gt; bag1 (data=&quot;chips&quot;,next=bag2) -&gt; bag2 (data=&quot;mayo&quot;,next=bag3) -&gt; bag3 (data=&quot;dip&quot;,next=null)\r\n\r\nIf the array passed to the removeAllOccurences method has a &quot;dip&quot; element, in order to remove it, the removeAllOccurences method would have to loop through the list and compare each element&#39;s data with &quot;dip&quot;. Once it reaches the bag3 object, it will find that it is in fact &quot;dip&quot;. In order to remove it, you&#39;d need to cut off the &#39;next&#39; reference inside of bag2 (make it null). To do that, you would need &#39;previous&#39; and &#39;current&#39; pointers. At that point, &#39;previous&#39; would be on bag2. So, you simply do:\r\n\r\n    previous.next = null;\r\n\r\nLastly, it would help you better understand LinkedList&#39;s add/remove methods if you visualize them.

Ty</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To remove all entries housed in the array, you need to loop the array element by element, and for each element you need to compare that element with each element in the LinkedBag. If that element matches anything in the LinkedBag chain of bags, then you break that reference by making the previous node point to the later node. This diagram should help you visualize the deletion process:</p>\n<pre><code>linkedBag (firstNode) -&gt; bag1 (data=&quot;chips&quot;,next=bag2) -&gt; bag2 (data=&quot;mayo&quot;,next=bag3) -&gt; bag3 (data=&quot;dip&quot;,next=null)\n</code></pre>\n<p>If the array passed to the removeAllOccurences method has a &quot;dip&quot; element, in order to remove it, the removeAllOccurences method would have to loop through the list and compare each element's data with &quot;dip&quot;. Once it reaches the bag3 object, it will find that it is in fact &quot;dip&quot;. In order to remove it, you'd need to cut off the 'next' reference inside of bag2 (make it null). To do that, you would need 'previous' and 'current' pointers. At that point, 'previous' would be on bag2. So, you simply do:</p>\n<pre><code>previous.next = null;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Lastly, it would help you better understand LinkedList's add/remove methods if you visualize them. Draw on paper, watch some visualizations on YouTube, and read an article about it, like <a href=\"https://www.devglan.com/datastructure/linkedlist-implementation-java\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":15628680,"reputation":501,"user_id":11275562,"display_name":"Icarus"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1666365662,"creation_date":1666365662,"answer_id":74155844,"question_id":74155576,"body_markdown":"To address your first concern: you are correct.\r\n\r\nTo address your second concern: the private constructors are to limit where Node can be created. \r\n\r\nlike so\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Test {\r\n    public Inner createInner(){\r\n        return new Inner();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class Inner{\r\n        private Inner(){\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;creating inner&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\npublic class main{\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        //works\r\n        Test t = new Test();\r\n        t.createInner();\r\n\r\n        //wont work\r\n        main.Test.Inner inner = new Test.Inner();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","title":"How adding element to Linked List","body":"<p>To address your first concern: you are correct.</p>\n<p>To address your second concern: the private constructors are to limit where Node can be created.</p>\n<p>like so</p>\n<pre><code>public class Test {\n    public Inner createInner(){\n        return new Inner();\n    }\n\n    public class Inner{\n        private Inner(){\n            System.out.println(&quot;creating inner&quot;);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>public class main{\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        //works\n        Test t = new Test();\n        t.createInner();\n\n        //wont work\n        main.Test.Inner inner = new Test.Inner();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":26691247,"reputation":28,"user_id":20299795,"display_name":"JaRek"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":110,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":74155844,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1666366695,"creation_date":1666364361,"question_id":74155576,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to understand the behavior of on how the elements of a String[] contentsOfBag are added into a linkedbag which is csc220bag (for this programming case).\r\n\r\nFirst concern: from my understanding, each elements of String[] contentsOfBag are added such as element &quot;A&quot; goes into a Node with the data &quot;A&quot;.

Below are the instructions as well as the code for this assignment. \r\n\r\n**Instructions:**\r\n\r\n&gt; Overview\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; As you have learned in Modules One and Two, various types of software\r\n&gt; testing can be employed for a given situation. For this assignment,\r\n&gt; you will be creating unit tests using code to uncover errors for a\r\n&gt; mobile application. You will develop the contact service and contact\r\n&gt; object.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Prompt\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; For Project One, which is due in Module Six, you are asked to develop\r\n&gt; a mobile application for a customer. The customer will provide you\r\n&gt; with the requirements. Your job is to code the application and provide\r\n&gt; unit tests to verify that the application meets the customer’s\r\n&gt; requirements. For this milestone, you will focus on delivering the\r\n&gt; contact services. The purpose of these services is to add, update, and\r\n&gt; delete contact objects within the application.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The contact service uses in-memory data structures to support storing\r\n&gt; contacts (no database required). In addition, there is no user\r\n&gt; interface for this milestone. You will verify the contact service\r\n&gt; through JUnit tests. The contact service contains a contact object\r\n&gt; along with the contact service. The requirements are outlined below.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Contact Class Requirements\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;  - The contact object shall have a required unique contact ID string that cannot be longer than 10 characters. The contact ID shall not be\r\n&gt; null and shall not be updatable.\r\n&gt;  - The contact object shall have a required firstName String field that cannot be longer than 10 characters. The firstName field shall\r\n&gt; not be null.\r\n&gt;  - The contact object shall have a required lastName String field that cannot be longer than 10 characters. The lastName field shall not be\r\n&gt; null.\r\n&gt;  - The contact object shall have a required phone String field that must be exactly 10 digits. The phone field shall not be null.\r\n&gt;  - The contact object shall have a required address field that must be no longer than 30 characters. The address field shall not be null.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Contact Service Requirements\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;  - The contact service shall be able to add contacts with a unique ID.\r\n&gt;  - The contact service shall be able to delete contacts per contact ID.\r\n&gt;  - The contact service shall be able to delete contacts per contact ID.\r\n&gt;  - The contact service shall be able to update contact fields per contact ID.

Below are the instructions as well as the code for this assignment.</p>\n<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Overview</p>\n<p>As you have learned in Modules One and Two, various types of software\ntesting can be employed for a given situation. For this assignment,\nyou will be creating unit tests using code to uncover errors for a\nmobile application. You will develop the contact service and contact\nobject.</p>\n<p>Prompt</p>\n<p>For Project One, which is due in Module Six, you are asked to develop\na mobile application for a customer. The customer will provide you\nwith the requirements. Your job is to code the application and provide\nunit tests to verify that the application meets the customer’s\nrequirements. For this milestone, you will focus on delivering the\ncontact services. The purpose of these services is to add, update, and\ndelete contact objects within the application.</p>\n<p>The contact service uses in-memory data structures to support storing\ncontacts (no database required). In addition, there is no user\ninterface for this milestone. You will verify the contact service\nthrough JUnit tests. The contact service contains a contact object\nalong with the contact service. The requirements are outlined below.</p>\n<p>Contact Class Requirements</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The contact object shall have a required unique contact ID string that cannot be longer than 10 characters. The contact ID shall not be\nnull and shall not be updatable.</li>\n<li>The contact object shall have a required firstName String field that cannot be longer than 10 characters. The firstName field shall\nnot be null.</li>\n<li>The contact object shall have a required lastName String field that cannot be longer than 10 characters. The lastName field shall not be\nnull.</li>\n<li>The contact object shall have a required phone String field that must be exactly 10 digits. The phone field shall not be null.</li>\n<li>The contact object shall have a required address field that must be no longer than 30 characters. The address field shall not be null.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contact Service Requirements</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The contact service shall be able to add contacts with a unique ID.</li>\n<li>The contact service shall be able to delete contacts per contact ID.</li>\n<li>The contact service shall be able to delete contacts per contact ID.</li>\n<li>The contact service shall be able to update contact fields per contact ID. The following fields are updatable:</li>\n<li>firstName</li>\n<li>lastName</li>\n<li>Number</li>\n<li>Address</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Contact.java</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>//Description: This is the contact class.
