I found that `onConfigurationChanged` called right before the app crashes on the same main thread as `onCreate` is called. `onStart` and `onResume` aren&#39;t called before the crash.   \r\nTo add more mystery to the whole thing, the crash happens only on Samsung devices (but on a verity of phones/tables models).  \r\nEven though I don&#39;t think my app is doing anything unique or unusual I couldn&#39;t find any similar reports online.\r\n\r\nAny ideas/suggestions would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n**Edit**    \r\nAdding more stack trace variants:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFatal Exception:

different variants of the stack trace, but they all go through some configuration change which led me to believe the user must be rotating the device while taking the picture and the app crashes when it's returning to the foreground in a different orientation.<br />\nMy app's activity has <code>android:configChanges=&quot;orientation|screenSize&quot;</code> in its manifest because it's containing a WebView, but it's not doing anything during <code>onConfigurationChanged</code>.<br />\nWhile investigating the crash I added logs to print the thread name and ID to the main lifecycle methods as well as to <code>onConfigurationChanged</code>. I found that <code>onConfigurationChanged</code> called right before the app crashes on the same main thread as <code>onCreate</code> is called. <code>onStart</code> and <code>onResume</code> aren't called before the crash.<br />\nTo add more mystery to the whole thing, the crash happens only on Samsung devices (but on a verity of phones/tables models).<br />\nEven though I don't think my app is doing anything unique or unusual I couldn't find any similar reports online.</p>\n<p>Any ideas/suggestions would be appreciated!</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong><br />\nAdding more stack trace

Here's an example using the built-in <code>Alphanumeric</code> class to order the tests alphanumerically using the test method name:</p>\n<pre><code>import org.junit.Test;\nimport org.junit.runner.OrderWith;\nimport org.junit.runner.manipulation.Alphanumeric;\n\n@OrderWith(Alphanumeric.class)\npublic class TestMethodOrder {\n\n    @Test\n    public void testA() {\n        System.out.println(&quot;first&quot;);\n    }\n    @Test\n    public void testB() {\n        System.out.println(&quot;second&quot;);\n    }\n    @Test\n    public void testC() {\n        System.out.println(&quot;third&quot;);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":745399,"reputation":872,"user_id":731938,"display_name":"Igor Kanshyn"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1621782513,"creation_date":1621782513,"answer_id":67661234,"question_id":3693626,"body_markdown":"It&#39;s time to move to **Junit5**.\r\nHere is a sample of what we could get:\r\n```\r\n@TestMethodOrder(MethodOrderer.OrderAnnotation.class)\r\n class OrderedTests {\r\n\r\n     @Test\r\n     @Order(1)\r\n     void nullValues() {}\r\n\r\n     @Test\r\n     @Order(2)\r\n     void emptyValues() {}\r\n\r\n     @Test\r\n     @Order(3)\r\n     void validValues() {}\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor **Junit4**, copy the logic that you have in several tests in one test method.\r\n","title":"How to run test methods in specific order in JUnit4?","body":"<p>It's time to move to <strong>Junit5</strong>.\nHere is a sample of what we could get:</p>\n<pre><code>@TestMethodOrder(MethodOrderer.OrderAnnotation.class)\n class OrderedTests {\n\n     @Test\n     @Order(1)\n     void nullValues() {}\n\n     @Test\n     @Order(2)\n     void emptyValues() {}\n\n     @Test\n     @Order(3)\n     void validValues() {}\n }\n</code></pre>\n<p>For <strong>Junit4</strong>, copy the logic that you have in several tests in one test method.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":6812029,"reputation":635,"user_id":5383834,"accept_rate":88,"display_name":"Wit"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1623310879,"creation_date":1623310879,"answer_id":67916772,"question_id":3693626,"body_markdown":"For JUnit 4, putting this annotation on the test class solved the problem.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.JVM)\r\n```","title":"How to run test methods in specific order in JUnit4?","body":"<p>For JUnit 4, putting this annotation on the test class solved the problem.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.JVM)\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":243644,"reputation":3925,"user_id":515973,"display_name":"Julien Carsique"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":false,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1625561854,"creation_date":1625561429,"answer_id":68267388,"question_id":3693626,"body_markdown":"**JUnit 4 update**\r\n\r\nAs of JUnit 4.13 `@OrderWith`, it is possible to reproduce the JUnit 5 `@Order` annotation.

I have tried implementing a lock in the main class so that the click doesnt even reach the Main class if the flag is set to busy but this also doesnt work.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","hibernate","configuration","weblogic","weblogic12c"],"owner":{"account_id":6849744,"reputation":1702,"user_id":5267244,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"David"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1684939637,"creation_date":1684939637,"question_id":76324780,"body_markdown":"I have a periodically executed task, that exceeds the configured transaction timeout.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Schedule(dayOfWeek=&quot;*&quot;, hour=&quot;0&quot;)\r\npublic void doStuff() {\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI cannot just set the transaction timeout for the whole weblogic server in the services/JTA section to a higher value, because it should stay at 30 seconds for all the other transactions that happen in the application and in other applications deployed on that WLS instance.\r\nI also cannot set the `TransactionAttributeType` of the `@TransactionAttribute`-annotation to `NOT_SUPPORTED` like suggested in related questions, because I need to write to the database in the scheduled `doStuff`-method and I get an `EJBTransactionRequiredException` if I try that without a transaction.\r\n\r\nI am using Hibernate as JPA framework and JEE7.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to configure a higher transaction timeout just for that method without changing the transaction timeout for any other beans deployed on the WLS?","title":"How to configure a transaction timeout for just one method on a Weblogic server?","body":"<p>I have a periodically executed task, that exceeds the configured transaction timeout.</p>\n<pre><code>@Schedule(dayOfWeek=&quot;*&quot;, hour=&quot;0&quot;)\npublic void doStuff() {\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I cannot just set the transaction timeout for the whole weblogic server in the services/JTA section to a higher value, because it should stay at 30 seconds for all the other transactions that happen in the application and in other applications deployed on that WLS instance.\nI also cannot set the <code>TransactionAttributeType</code> of the <code>@TransactionAttribute</code>-annotation to <code>NOT_SUPPORTED</code> like suggested in related questions, because I need to write to the database in the scheduled <code>doStuff</code>-method and I get an <code>EJBTransactionRequiredException</code> if I try that without a transaction.</p>\n<p>I am using Hibernate as JPA framework and JEE7.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to configure a higher transaction timeout just for that method without changing the transaction timeout for any other beans deployed on the WLS?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","jooq"],"owner":{"account_id":14854779,"reputation":392,"user_id":10727630,"display_name":"reans"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1684939447,"creation_date":1684939447,"question_id":76324757,"body_markdown":"I build up a list of these inserts with Jooq:\r\n\r\n```\r\n//loop\r\n\r\ninserts.add(\r\n   context\r\n      .insertInto(MY_TABLE, MY_TABLE.STATUS, MY_TABLE.NAME)\r\n      .select(context.select(\r\n         val(&quot;some status&quot;),\r\n         val(&quot;some name&quot;),\r\n      ))\r\n      //some filtering logic\r\n    \r\n      .returningResult(MY_TABLE.ID)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I batch execute:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIterators.partition(inserts.iterator(), 50)\r\n      .forEachRemaining(inserts -&gt; {\r\n      sql.batch(inserts).execute();\r\n     \r\n      //get the inserted ids\r\n\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe inserts work fine, but I can&#39;t work out how to get the inserted rows/ids back.

I think it might have occurred when I created my second project (this one) using a pom.xml.</p>\n<p>I am quite close to completely clueless as to what is happening here so any ideas are appreciated!</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","makefile","gson","classpath"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":372682,"reputation":22426,"user_id":721855,"display_name":"aled"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1684928791,"creation_date":1684928791,"answer_id":76323181,"question_id":76320619,"body_markdown":"When you execute one of your jars with your script you need to ensure that a directory lib with the gson.jar (`lib/gson.jar`) is accessible from your execution directory.
