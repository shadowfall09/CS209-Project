So, we&#39;re going inside while loop, append `tokens[0]` to `sbuf` and **increase** our `i`. So now `i` is 1 and points to `+`, while condition is `false`, we parse `&quot;1&quot;` into 1 and add it to `values`.

Usually that boils down to a few things:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Structure your code with clean separation of concerns so that individual parts can be unit tested. TDD is a good way to achieve this.</li>\n  <li>Use constructor injection to ensure that objects can be instantiated directly. Don’t use field injection as it just makes your tests harder to write.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1200383,"reputation":1680,"user_id":1171170,"accept_rate":69,"display_name":"JiKra"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":7199,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":57871263,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1667214799,"creation_date":1568113437,"question_id":57869463,"body_markdown":"I have a service SomeService with one method to do some logic.\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public CompletableFuture&lt;Boolean&gt; process(User user) {\r\n        Objects.requiredNonNull(user, &quot;user must not be null&quot;);\r\n        // other logic...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen I have a test for this.\r\n\r\n    @RunWith(SpringRunner.class)\r\n    @SpringBootTest(classes = { SomeService.class })\r\n    public class SomeServiceTest {\r\n        @Autowired private SomeService tested;\r\n        @Test\r\n        public void user_null_expect_NullPointerException() {\r\n            assertThatThrownBy(() -&gt; tested.process(null))\r\n                    .isInstanceOf(NullPointerException.class)\r\n                    .hasMessage(&quot;user must not be null&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIt worked fine until I decided to make that method asynchronous.\r\n\r\n    @Async\r\n    @Override\r\n    public CompletableFuture&lt;Boolean&gt; process(User user) {\r\n        Objects.requiredNonNull(user, &quot;user must not be null&quot;);\r\n        // other logic...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo, now it doesn&#39;t work because of Spring proxies.\r\nDoes anyone have an idea how I must configure my test to make it work again?","title":"Testing @Async annotated method in @SpringBootTest","body":"<p>I have a service SomeService with one method to do some logic.</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Override\npublic CompletableFuture&lt;Boolean&gt; process(User user) {\n    Objects.requiredNonNull(user, \"user must not be null\");\n    // other logic...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then I have a test for this.</p>\n\n<pre><code>@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)\n@SpringBootTest(classes = { SomeService.class })\npublic class SomeServiceTest {\n    @Autowired private SomeService tested;\n    @Test\n    public void user_null_expect_NullPointerException() {\n        assertThatThrownBy(() -&gt; tested.process(null))\n                .isInstanceOf(NullPointerException.class)\n                .hasMessage(\"user must not be null\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It worked fine until I decided to make that method asynchronous.</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Async\n@Override\npublic CompletableFuture&lt;Boolean&gt; process(User user) {\n    Objects.requiredNonNull(user, \"user must not be null\");\n    // other logic...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, now it doesn't work because of Spring proxies.\nDoes anyone have an idea how I must configure my test to make it work again?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":4829578,"reputation":4682,"user_id":3898076,"accept_rate":72,"display_name":"Naman Gala"},"score":0,"creation_date":1423809800,"post_id":28493856,"comment_id":45308006,"body_markdown":"which `id` do you want to convert from int to String?","body":"which <code>id</code> do you want to convert from int to String?"},{"owner":{"account_id":4829578,"reputation":4682,"user_id":3898076,"accept_rate":72,"display_name":"Naman Gala"},"score":0,"creation_date":1423810006,"post_id":28493856,"comment_id":45308067,"body_markdown":"possible duplicate of http://stackoverflow.com/q/4105331/3898076","body":"possible duplicate of <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/4105331/3898076\">stackoverflow.com/q/4105331/3898076</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":5751003,"reputation":51,"user_id":4540698,"accept_rate":80,"display_name":"KirbyD"},"score":0,"creation_date":1423810052,"post_id":28493856,"comment_id":45308089,"body_markdown":"aw okey ill try it later","body":"aw okey ill try it later"},{"owner":{"account_id":4829578,"reputation":4682,"user_id":3898076,"accept_rate":72,"display_name":"Naman Gala"},"score":0,"creation_date":1423810206,"post_id":28493856,"comment_id":45308145,"body_markdown":"You can define another setter in your class which takes String as input and convert it to int and set the value of id.

Thats why you see no effect. Apply the rotation to the graphics you are painting on and it will draw the image rotated:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {\n    g.clearRect(0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight());\n    g.rotate(Math.toRadians(rotation), img.getWidth() / 2, img.getHeight() / 2);\n    g.drawImage(img, imgx, imgy, null);\n    this.repaint();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will probably not draw entirely what you expect, the rotation will revolve around the coordinate origin. For the image to be rotate around its center you need to apply a coordinate translation before the rotation, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>g.translate(imgx &gt;&gt; 1, imgy &gt;&gt; 1);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/advanced/transforming.html/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Graphics2D Tutorial</a> has some more examples.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":100718,"reputation":43156,"user_id":271357,"accept_rate":83,"display_name":"dacwe"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":20,"is_accepted":true,"score":20,"last_activity_date":1621793577,"creation_date":1297072241,"answer_id":4919880,"question_id":4918482,"body_markdown":"I would use [`Graphics2D.drawImage(image, affinetranform, imageobserver)`][1].\r\n\r\nThe code example below rotates and translates an image to the center of the component.

I expected, that standart blocking api to die with NoSpaceLeftException or be much slower than reactive application. But it turned out the opposite. Blocking API's read from database is much faster: 3 seconds (blocking API) VS 9 seconds (Reactor). In db are only 10 records. With inserts similar situation.</p>\n<p>Blocking Api results\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cRITw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cRITw.png\" alt=\"Blocking API results\" /></a></p>\n<p>Project reactor results\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z3OBt.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z3OBt.png\" alt=\"Project reactor\" /></a></p>\n<p>Could someone explain to me where am i wrong?</p>\n<p>I want to know why reactor so slow? Maybe my test case is not good for this purpose. Maybe my expects about Project Reactor advantages is not correct.

project using jdk 11 and in order get decent testcoverage, i added something to mock calls/answers to/from external services. So i included **wiremock**. \r\nAs suggested on their [setup getting-started section](https://wiremock.org/docs/getting-started/), i included\r\n```\r\ntestImplementation &quot;com.github.tomakehurst:wiremock-jre8:2.34.0&quot;\r\n```\r\nEven though everything works on my machine (and tests run fine on the pipeline), i don&#39;t know if this will potentially cause issues on other machines. The architect involved in the project also stated his concern that we do only use jre 11. \r\n\r\nTherefore i need some more insight to either change things up or argue why this is not an issue.\r\n\r\n## Attempts so far\r\n\r\nI expected there to be an higher version of wiremock on mavencentral, but ther were only two projects:\r\n- [mvnrepository: wiremock](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.tomakehurst/wiremock) - last updated Sep, **2020**\r\n- [mvnrepository: wiremock-jre8](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.tomakehurst/wiremock-jre8) - last updated Sep, **2022**\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, wiremock-jre8 was the most recent version.

So it would be nice to not downgrade the current implementation to a less readable solution.\r\n\r\nI should mention, that i only guess that wiremock-jre8 has been compiled with jdk8 from the naming. I did not find any evidence about what compiler did produce the bytecode for either of those dependencies or clues on how to interpret this.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to figure out how back and forwards combability works with java, the compiler and the produced bytecode, i found this [older post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4692626/is-jdk-upward-or-backward-compatible#:~:text=The%20compiler%20is%20not%20backwards,it%20can%20run%20older%20bytecodes.).
