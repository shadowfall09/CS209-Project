I am trying to figure it out for days now but not getting anywhere.</p>\n<pre><code>    private void getTravelTime() {\n\n        final String API_KEY = &quot;MyAPIKey&quot;;\n        final String ORIGINS = getCompleteAddress(l.getLatitue(),l.getLongitude());\n       final String DESTINATIONS = getCompleteAddress(l1.getLatitue(), l1.getLongitude());\n       \n\n        GMapAPIService gMapAPIService = RetrofitService.getRetrofitClient().create(GMapAPIService.class);\n\n        Call&lt;DistanceMatrixResponse&gt; call = gMapAPIService.getDistance(API_KEY, ORIGINS, DESTINATIONS);\n\n        call.enqueue(new Callback&lt;DistanceMatrixResponse&gt;() {\n            @Override\n            public void onResponse(Call&lt;DistanceMatrixResponse&gt; call, Response&lt;DistanceMatrixResponse&gt; response) {\n\n                Log.d(&quot;l&quot;, String.valueOf(l.getLatitue()+ &quot; &quot;+l.getLongitude()));\n                Log.d(&quot;l1&quot;, String.valueOf(l1.getLatitue()+ &quot; &quot;+l1.getLongitude()));\n                if (response.isSuccessful()) {\n                    DistanceMatrixResponse distanceMatrixResponse = response.body();\n                    Log.d(&quot;T1&quot;,&quot;Here&quot;);\n\n                    if (distanceMatrixResponse != null) {\n\n                        List&lt;DistanceMatrixRow&gt; rows = distanceMatrixResponse.getRows();\n                        Log.d(&quot;T2&quot;,&quot;Here&quot;);\n                        if (rows != null &amp;&amp; !rows.isEmpty()) {\n                            Log.d(&quot;T3&quot;,&quot;Here&quot;);\n                            DistanceMatrixRow distanceMatrixRow = rows.get(0);\n                            Log.d(&quot;D2&quot;,String.valueOf(distanceMatrixRow));\n\n                            if (distanceMatrixRow != null) {\n                                Log.d(&quot;T4&quot;,&quot;Here&quot;);\n                                DistanceMatrixElement distanceMatrixElement = distanceMatrixRow.getElements().get(0);\n                                Log.d(&quot;D2&quot;,String.valueOf(distanceMatrixElement));\n\n                                if (distanceMatrixElement != null) {\n                                    Log.d(&quot;T5&quot;,&quot;Here&quot;);\n                                    Duration duration = distanceMatrixElement.getDuration();\n                                    Distance d=distanceMatrixElement.getDistance();\n                                    Log.d(&quot;Duration:&quot;,String.valueOf(duration));\n                                    Log.d(&quot;Distance:&quot;,String.valueOf(d));\n\n\n                                    if (duration != null) {\n                                        Log.d(&quot;T6&quot;,&quot;Here&quot;);\n                                        String travelTime = duration.getText();\n                                        textViewTravelTime.setText(travelTime);\n                                    }\n                                }\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n\n\n            @Override\n            public void onFailure(Call&lt;DistanceMatrixResponse&gt; call, Throwable t) {\n\n                Log.e(&quot;MainActivity&quot;, t.getMessage());\n            }\n        });\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ACnpK.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This is the output I am getting</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["java","maven","maven-release-plugin"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2993414,"reputation":12019,"user_id":2540471,"display_name":"Robert Scholte"},"score":0,"creation_date":1681553724,"post_id":76017930,"comment_id":134077368,"body_markdown":"Did you check https://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/prepare-mojo.html#javaHome ?

If I use `release:prepare` instead of `clean package` at the end (still with jdk11), the output is `java version: 1.8.0_231-b11`. So somehow the maven-release-plugin does not use the jdk which is used for the execution of maven, but uses `JAVA_HOME` instead. This only happens when using the release plugin.

My customer has a specific old version of Raspbian that can not more updated and a java can not be installed. Previous games for him were created using Lua and Love2D. I have created a videogame using Java and LibGDX. To launch the game on his Raspberry Pi 3B I need to integrate Java in the game. I have tried to use JPackage. It works perfect on Windows. But it doesn't work on Ubuntu X64 (I use Khadas Vim3 pro) and Raspberry Pi OS 64 bit (I tested on my Raspberry Pi 4B). It shows an error.

There are major mistakes and misconceptions in your approach and some smaller improvements that could be made in your code.\r\n\r\nMajor problems:\r\n\r\n 1. You don&#39;t need to (and should not) create another thread to pause, use a [`PauseTransition`](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/17/javafx.graphics/javafx/animation/PauseTransition.html).\r\n 2. You should *never* sleep the JavaFX thread.\r\n 3. You should *never* modify the properties of nodes in the Scene Graph or Stages from any thread other than the JavaFX thread.\r\n 4. GUIs are event-driven, so respond to and generate events (e.g. [`PauseTransition.onFinished`](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/17/javafx.graphics/javafx/animation/Animation.html#onFinishedProperty)) rather than code loops.\r\n 5. *Never* loop forever on the JavaFX thread - nothing will happen in the GUI.\r\n\r\nOther improvements:\r\n\r\n 1. An application should only be responsible for the application lifecycle.\r\n 2. An application should not implement runnable.\r\n 3. To get the working directory, use the [system property &quot;user.dir&quot;](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/sysprop.html).\r\n 4. Don&#39;t write a function to get random ints in ranges [use the built-in library function for that](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/ThreadLocalRandom.html#nextInt(int,int)).\r\n 5. Follow [naming conventions](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-namingconventions.html) *always*.\r\n 6. Setting a no-match key and no hint for full-screen exit seems like a bad idea for most apps.\r\n 7. Don&#39;t define variables like the misnamed `Dir`, which you never use.\r\n 8. Code should be [properly formatted][1].\r\n 9. Bind to properties instead of the weird Bindings selection scheme you use, e.g. you could write `viewer.fitWidthProperty().bind(scene.widthProperty())`.\r\n 10. But also, don&#39;t use binding for layout, use layout panes with minimal appropriate layout hints.\r\n 11. Don&#39;t use fully qualified names in code unnecessarily, instead add the appropriate import statements.  \r\n\r\nRelated:\r\n\r\n * [Example JavaFX media player](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12548603/playing-audio-using-javafx-mediaplayer-in-a-normal-java-application/12548929#12548929).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/reformat-and-rearrange-code.html","title":"How to stop current thread while MediaPlayer is playing video?","body":"<p>Unfortunately, your approach is all wrong.

Readability\r\n- Alternative 2 has less number of lines\r\n- Alternative 2 read more close to `return a list containing number divisible by 6 from numList`, while forEach approach means add number divisible by 6 from numList to `secondInts`\r\n- `filter(i -&gt; i % 6 == 0)` is straight forward and \r\n  ```\r\n  if(i % 6 != 0) {\r\n      return;\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  require some time for human brain to process.\r\n### 2. Performance\r\n\r\nFrom [`Stream.toList()`][1]\r\n  &gt; Implementation Note:\r\nMost instances of Stream will override this method and provide an implementation that is highly optimized compared to the implementation in this interface.\r\n\r\nWe benefit from optimization from JDK by using Stream API.  \r\n\r\nAnd in this case, using forEach and adding element one by one will be slower, especially when the list is large. It is because `ArrayList` will need to extend it capacity whenever the list full, while Stream implementation `ImmutableCollections.listFromTrustedArrayNullsAllowed` just store the result array into `ListN`.\r\n\r\nOne more point to note about parallelism:  \r\nFrom [`Stream#forEach`][2]\r\n&gt;The behavior of this operation is explicitly nondeterministic. For parallel stream pipelines, this operation does not guarantee to respect the encounter order of the stream, as doing so would sacrifice the benefit of parallelism. For any given element, the action may be performed at whatever time and in whatever thread the library chooses.

This tells the JAX-RS runtime, that if the wrapped Exception is raised, return the response code defined in the <code>ExceptionMapper</code>.  </p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":15437,"reputation":2139,"user_id":32595,"display_name":"dshaw"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":7,"is_accepted":false,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1466036065,"creation_date":1238087460,"answer_id":686720,"question_id":583973,"body_markdown":"I too like [StaxMan][1] would probably implement that QueryParam as a String, then handle the conversion, rethrowing as necessary.\r\n\r\nIf the locale specific behavior is the desired and expected behavior, you would use the following to return the 400 BAD REQUEST error:\r\n\r\n`throw new WebApplicationException(Response.Status.BAD_REQUEST);`\r\n\r\nSee the JavaDoc for [javax.ws.rs.core.Response.Status][2] for more options.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/583973/jax-rs-jersey-how-to-customize-error-handling/597252#597252\r\n  [2]: http://www.jboss.org/file-access/default/members/resteasy/freezone/docs/1.0.0.GA/javadocs/javax/ws/rs/core/Response.Status.html","title":"JAX-RS / Jersey how to customize error handling?","body":"<p>I too like <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/583973/jax-rs-jersey-how-to-customize-error-handling/597252#597252\">StaxMan</a> would probably implement that QueryParam as a String, then handle the conversion, rethrowing as necessary.</p>\n\n<p>If the locale specific behavior is the desired and expected behavior, you would use the following to return the 400 BAD REQUEST error:</p>\n\n<p><code>throw new WebApplicationException(Response.Status.BAD_REQUEST);</code></p>\n\n<p>See the JavaDoc for <a href=\"http://www.jboss.org/file-access/default/members/resteasy/freezone/docs/1.0.0.GA/javadocs/javax/ws/rs/core/Response.Status.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">javax.ws.rs.core.Response.Status</a> for more options.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":673865,"reputation":5306,"user_id":889053,"accept_rate":38,"display_name":"Christian Bongiorno"},"score":0,"creation_date":1341538525,"post_id":1332506,"comment_id":14955615,"body_markdown":"I am trying to add a custom query param handler in Jersey (migrating from CXF) this looks remarkably similar to what I am doing but I don&#39;t know how to install/create a new provider.

note on comment\r\n\r\n&gt; Java has try-with-resources, which is probably the best way, except in certain circumstances, one of which you are using System.in (as you are doing) and wish to avoid closing it prematurely. Once closed, that stream remains closed. \r\n\r\nSo, despite all the above example, I don&#39;t think you should close at a Scanner which scans the `System.in` (but there may be reasons) \r\n\r\n```\r\n  public static void main( String[] args )\r\n    {\r\n        final Scanner readerUserTerminal = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n        try (\r\n            readerUserTerminal;\r\n        ) {\r\n            System.out.print(&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt; username: &quot;);\r\n            if (readerUserTerminal.hasNextLine()) {\r\n                String username = readerUserTerminal.nextLine();\r\n                System.out.format(&quot;Hello %s&quot;, username);\r\n            }\r\n        } catch (NoSuchElementException | IllegalStateException error) {\r\n            System.out.format(&quot;Error while reading scanner, reason: %s&quot;, error);\r\n            error.printStackTrace();\r\n        } catch (Exception error) {\r\n            System.out.format(&quot;Something went wrong while reading scanner, reason: %s&quot;, error);\r\n            error.printStackTrace();\r\n        }\r\n        // yea no ... will break...\r\n        Scanner second = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n        System.out.print(&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt; username: &quot;);\r\n        String username2 = second.nextLine();\r\n        System.out.format(&quot;Hello %s&quot;, username2);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n**output**\r\n```\r\nHello fede&gt;&gt;&gt; username: Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.util.NoSuchElementException: No line found\r\n\tat java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextLine(Scanner.java:1651)\r\n\tat com.koubae.app1.Main.main(Main.java:39)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**So be careful!**, I am actually surpise since, in many many tutorials they are using the Scanner to read user input from terminal and then show to close it, wich, not being a File, but the System.in (for me is like `stdin` like in C or python `sys.stdin`.

The `EntityManager` you receive from Spring is actually a shared proxy of type `SharedEntityManagerInvocationHandler` which proxies the methods called on it. Specifically methods that return a `Query` interface (i.e. `createQuery`) return another proxy for the actual `Query` object.\r\n\r\nThat proxy has a list of methods which it considers to be terminating, called `queryTerminatingMethods`. The list contains: \t\t\t\r\n\r\n- &quot;execute&quot;,  // jakarta.persistence.StoredProcedureQuery.execute()\r\n- &quot;executeUpdate&quot;, // jakarta.persistence.Query.executeUpdate()\r\n- &quot;getSingleResult&quot;,  // jakarta.persistence.Query.getSingleResult()\r\n- &quot;getResultStream&quot;,  // jakarta.persistence.Query.getResultStream()\r\n- &quot;getResultList&quot;,  // jakarta.persistence.Query.getResultList()\r\n- &quot;list&quot;,  // org.hibernate.query.Query.list()\r\n- &quot;stream&quot;,  // org.hibernate.query.Query.stream()\r\n- &quot;uniqueResult&quot;,  // org.hibernate.query.Query.uniqueResult() \t\t\t\r\n- &quot;uniqueResultOptional&quot; // org.hibernate.query.Query.uniqueResultOptional()\r\n\r\nFor all those methods the proxy will automatically close the shared entity manager after invoking them, which also in turn releases the connection. `scroll` is missing from the list, which makes sense. And this is the reason why it leaks a connection here. You can also not just call `close` on the proxied EntityManager Spring provides, because that actually does nothing.\r\n\r\nYou can also confirm this behaviour by creating your own `EntityManager` with the Spring provided `EntityManagerFactory` before executing the query (which in most cases you wouldn&#39;t want/need to do).

It knows what to do with it: subscribe to it and propagate its elements in the output sequence. As a result, the return type is `Flux&lt;V&gt;`: `flatMap` will flatten each inner `Publisher&lt;V&gt;` into the output sequence of _all_ the `V`s.\r\n\r\n**About the 1-N aspect:**\r\n\r\nfor each `&lt;T&gt;` input element, `flatMap` maps it to a `Publisher&lt;V&gt;`.

You end up with a single `Flux&lt;Badge&gt;` of all the badges of all these users.\r\n\r\n**Is `map` really synchronous and _non-blocking_?**\r\n\r\nYes: it is synchronous in the way the operator applies it (a simple method call, and then the operator emits the result) and non-blocking in the sense that the function itself shouldn&#39;t block the operator calling it. In other terms it shouldn&#39;t introduce latency. That&#39;s because a `Flux` is still asynchronous as a whole. If it blocks mid-sequence, it will impact the rest of the `Flux` processing, or even other `Flux`.\r\n\r\nIf your map function is blocking/introduces latency but cannot be converted to return a `Publisher`, consider `publishOn`/`subscribeOn` to offset that blocking work on a separate thread.","title":"map vs flatMap in reactor","body":"<ul>\n<li><code>map</code> is for synchronous, non-blocking, 1-to-1 transformations</li>\n<li><code>flatMap</code> is for asynchronous (non-blocking) 1-to-N transformations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The difference is visible in the method signature: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>map</code> takes a <code>Function&lt;T, U&gt;</code> and returns a <code>Flux&lt;U&gt;</code></li>\n<li><code>flatMap</code> takes a <code>Function&lt;T, Publisher&lt;V&gt;&gt;</code> and returns a <code>Flux&lt;V&gt;</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That's the major hint: you <em>can</em> pass a <code>Function&lt;T, Publisher&lt;V&gt;&gt;</code> to a <code>map</code>, but it wouldn't know what to do with the <code>Publishers</code>, and that would result in a <code>Flux&lt;Publisher&lt;V&gt;&gt;</code>, a sequence of inert publishers.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, <code>flatMap</code> expects a <code>Publisher&lt;V&gt;</code> for each <code>T</code>.
