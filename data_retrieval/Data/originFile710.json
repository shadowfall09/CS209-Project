However, you need to keep in mind that naming strategies applies globally, so, when you adopting third-party library or a plugin, based on `JPA`, you might get &quot;surprised&quot; that that library or plugin conflicts with your naming strategy.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. predictable names make sense:\r\n\r\n-  when you diagnose performance issues, DBAs typically tell you what queries are slow, after that you need somehow determine what code produces those slow queries (there we need to say &quot;thanks&quot; to `spring-data-jpa` for their naming convention), and that takes a time to match SQL query to JPQL query, and usage of naming strategies is not your friend there. If you think SQL queries do not make sense and you can collect performance statistics using `micrometer`/`grafana`, I have bad news for you: [that does not work in Hibernate](https://discourse.hibernate.org/t/performance-issues-when-enabling-micrometer-metrics/7035)\r\n- naming strategies somehow try to cover table and column names, but do not cover index names, which is actually important from performance perspective: try to guess what columns are covered by index with name like `UK_jymdjmt0g2vxkk0fp56xlhjud`. Need to ask DBA? OK, your code is unmaintainable...

It wouldn&#39;t be as efficient as what we typically call a stack, but it would be LIFO.\r\n\r\nThat `PriorityStack` can more easily be implemented with a `PriorityQueue`, and probably a whole lot more efficiently. The only catch is that you&#39;ll either need to add a `time` field to your `Dog` class, or wrap the `Dog` object in another class that has a `time` field. I&#39;d favor the latter: call it `PQDog`. And of course you&#39;ll need a custom comparer.\r\n\r\nThe `time` field doesn&#39;t have to be the actual time something was enqueued. It could be an integer if you make sure to increment it for each item enqueued. Provided you&#39;re not going to enqueue more than 2 billion items over the lifetime of the queue. Come to think of it, if you start the sequence at `Integer.MinValue` (or whatever it&#39;s called in Java), you could extend that range to 4 billion.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that you&#39;d define the class:\r\n\r\n    class PQDog {\r\n      int sequenceNumber;\r\n      Dog dog;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not really a Java programmer, so don&#39;t expect the code below to compile without trouble. But I think it&#39;s enough to point you in the right direction.\r\n\r\nWhen you want to put a `Dog` in the queue, you wrap it in a `PQDog` object and add the new sequence number. Imagine you have a static variable called `QueueSequence` that you increment every time just before enqueueing.\r\n\r\n    PriorityQueue dogQueue = new PriorityQueue&lt;PQDog&gt;();\r\n    static int QueueSequence = 0;\r\n\r\n    // and to add something to the queue\r\n    PQDog newDog = new PQDog(QueueSequence++, Dog);\r\n    dogQueue.add(newDog);\r\n\r\nAnd of course when you `pop` from the queue you&#39;ll have to unwrap the `Dog`.\r\n\r\nIt seems like your ordering requirement is &quot;By ascending age and descending time&quot;. So your comparer would be something like:\r\n\r\n    public int compareTo(PQDog other) {\r\n        if(other == null) {\r\n            return -1;\r\n        }\r\n        // sort younger dogs first\r\n        if (this.Dog.age &lt; other.Dog.age) return -1;\r\n        if (this.Dog.age &gt; other.Dog.age) return 1;\r\n    \r\n        // ages are the same, so compare enqueue time\r\n        if (this.sequenceNumber &gt; other.sequenceNumber) return -1;\r\n        if (this.sequenceNumber &lt; other.sequenceNumber) return 1;\r\n\r\n        // Probably should raise an exception here\r\n        // If you have two entries with the same sequence number,\r\n        // something has gone horribly wrong.\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOr, if the `Dog` class already has a `CompareTo` that compares by age, you&#39;d change the above code to:\r\n\r\n    if (this.Dog.CompareTo(other.Dog) == 0) return;\r\n\r\n    // and then compare the sequenceNumbers if the\r\n    // dogs&#39; ages aren&#39;t equal.\r\n\r\nSeems silly to me to introduce an incomplete and un-vetted custom `PriorityStack` data structure when you can solve your problem using the standard Java `PriorityQueue`, a custom comparer, and a few lines of interface code.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, you shouldn&#39;t in general use `return a - b` in a `Comparable`.

It wouldn't be as efficient as what we typically call a stack, but it would be LIFO.</p>\n<p>That <code>PriorityStack</code> can more easily be implemented with a <code>PriorityQueue</code>, and probably a whole lot more efficiently. The only catch is that you'll either need to add a <code>time</code> field to your <code>Dog</code> class, or wrap the <code>Dog</code> object in another class that has a <code>time</code> field. I'd favor the latter: call it <code>PQDog</code>. And of course you'll need a custom comparer.</p>\n<p>The <code>time</code> field doesn't have to be the actual time something was enqueued. It could be an integer if you make sure to increment it for each item enqueued. Provided you're not going to enqueue more than 2 billion items over the lifetime of the queue. Come to think of it, if you start the sequence at <code>Integer.MinValue</code> (or whatever it's called in Java), you could extend that range to 4 billion.</p>\n<p>The idea is that you'd define the class:</p>\n<pre><code>class PQDog {\n  int sequenceNumber;\n  Dog dog;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm not really a Java programmer, so don't expect the code below to compile without trouble. But I think it's enough to point you in the right direction.</p>\n<p>When you want to put a <code>Dog</code> in the queue, you wrap it in a <code>PQDog</code> object and add the new sequence number. Imagine you have a static variable called <code>QueueSequence</code> that you increment every time just before enqueueing.</p>\n<pre><code>PriorityQueue dogQueue = new PriorityQueue&lt;PQDog&gt;();\nstatic int QueueSequence = 0;\n\n// and to add something to the queue\nPQDog newDog = new PQDog(QueueSequence++, Dog);\ndogQueue.add(newDog);\n</code></pre>\n<p>And of course when you <code>pop</code> from the queue you'll have to unwrap the <code>Dog</code>.</p>\n<p>It seems like your ordering requirement is &quot;By ascending age and descending time&quot;. So your comparer would be something like:</p>\n<pre><code>public int compareTo(PQDog other) {\n    if(other == null) {\n        return -1;\n    }\n    // sort younger dogs first\n    if (this.Dog.age &lt; other.Dog.age) return -1;\n    if (this.Dog.age &gt; other.Dog.age) return 1;\n\n    // ages are the same, so compare enqueue time\n    if (this.sequenceNumber &gt; other.sequenceNumber) return -1;\n    if (this.sequenceNumber &lt; other.sequenceNumber) return 1;\n\n    // Probably should raise an exception here\n    // If you have two entries with the same sequence number,\n    // something has gone horribly wrong.\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or, if the <code>Dog</code> class already has a <code>CompareTo</code> that compares by age, you'd change the above code to:</p>\n<pre><code>if (this.Dog.CompareTo(other.Dog) == 0) return;\n\n// and then compare the sequenceNumbers if the\n// dogs' ages aren't equal.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Seems silly to me to introduce an incomplete and un-vetted custom <code>PriorityStack</code> data structure when you can solve your problem using the standard Java <code>PriorityQueue</code>, a custom comparer, and a few lines of interface code.</p>\n<p>As an aside, you shouldn't in general use <code>return a - b</code> in a <code>Comparable</code>. Imagine what happens when <code>a</code> is equal to the minimum integer (or sufficiently negative, anyway) and <code>b</code> is a large enough positive number. Integer overflow (actually underflow, but same thing) rears its ugly head.

More generally, this is a _very_ outdated notion that used to be a somewhat common refrain, and various lecturers still espouse it:\r\n\r\nThe idea that, if you have a class, you make a tandem interface that contains every (public) method in that class; given that the class already occupies the name of the concept, the interface can&#39;t be given a good name, and thus, an I is prefixed.

It&#39;s a ton of typing, even if you use tools to auto-generate it, everytime you change one you are then forced to change the other, and __there is no point to it__.\r\n\r\nThere are exotic and mostly irrelevant ways in which you get a &#39;more tight coupling&#39; between a user of the `Student` class and the `Student` class code itself vs. having that user use `IStudent` instead. It sounds like either you or more likely perhaps the lecturer is confused and presumed that this tight coupling implies that _any_ change in `Student.java` would thus require a recompile.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if those examples are from the lecture, oh boy. `double` is absolutely not at all acceptable for financial anything. That should most likely be an `int` or `long`, representing cents (or whatever passes for &#39;atomic monetary unit&#39; for the currency in question; pennies for pounds, satoshis for bitcoin, yen for yen, and so on). In rare cases, `BigDecimal`. In any case, not, ever, `double` or `float`.\r\n\r\nYou need to recompile B, where B uses something from A, if:\r\n\r\n* You change the value of a constant in A that is used directly used by B, and that constant was &#39;CTC&#39; (Compile Time Constant). Only the primitives and strings can be CTC, and they are CTC if the field is `static final`, _and_ is immediately initialized (vs. initialized in a separate `static {}` block), _and_ whose expression is itself CTC, which means its comprised of literals and possibly simple operations between CTCs, e.g. in `static final int a = 5; static final int b = a + 10;`, `b` is also CTC. In contrast, e.g. `static final long c = System.currentTimeMillis();` is not a compile time constant because `System.currentTimeMillis()` isn&#39;t, for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n* You change a signature of any element in A that B uses. Even if the caller (B.java here) can be recompiled with zero changes. For example, you have in `A.java`: `void foo(String param)` and you change that `void foo(Object param)`. Even though `foo(&quot;hello&quot;)` is a valid call to either method, you still need to recompile here. Relevant elements are the name of the method, the types of the parameters (not the names), and the return type. Changing the exceptions you throw is fine.

For example, `java.util.List` is the interface, `java.util.LinkedList` and `java.util.ArrayList` are meaningfully different implementations of the same idea.\r\n\r\n* It&#39;s slightly easier to make an implementation of the interface specifically for test purposes. However, mocks and extending the class are generalized solutions to this problem too and usually work just as well, and more generally making a test-specific impl requires more care than just a rote application of the &#39;make a mirroring interface&#39; principle.\r\n\r\n* You get an extra level of access - you can have `public` things in the class that nevertheless aren&#39;t mirrored in the interface, and thus, are not &#39;accessible&#39; via the interface. There is a single good reason to make things `public` when they aren&#39;t really meant for external consumption: When you have a multi-package system. Java&#39;s module system acknowledges this too, and (via the &#39;exported package&#39; concept) also introduces, effectively, another access level (a `public` thing in a non-exported package is not accessible from other modules, it&#39;s not as public as a `public` thing in an exported package).

common behavior would have to be re-implemented several times (no [DRI][1]).  No continuity of the professor when she/he changes category.  \r\n* **Candidate 2**: A class `Professor` with an enum `Category` that may take the values `Full`, `Associate`, and `Assistant`. &lt;br&gt;Advantage: simple class design.&lt;br&gt;\r\nInconvenience:  operations must implement a lot of conditional statements to implement category-specific behavior.  And if some category of professors need additional properties, you&#39;ll have them for all.  Worse:  it&#39;s very difficult to add new categories of professors since you&#39;d need to change the original class (no [OCP][2]).\r\n* **Candidate 3**:   A class `Professor` specialized in three classes `FullProfessor`, `AssociateProfessor`, and `AssistantProfessor`. &lt;br&gt;Advantage: the common behavior is defined only once;  each specialization can redefine some behavior and enrich the base class. It&#39;s also easy to add new classes of professors.&lt;br&gt;Inconvenience:  it is difficult to change class of a professor if his/her category changes (although this is not forbidden in UML, most languages don&#39;t allow it).  \r\n* **Candidate 4**:  A class `Professor` refers to a current `State`, and forwards state-dependend behaviors to the state. Three specializations of of `State`: `StateFullProfessor`, `StateAssociateProfessor`, and `StateAssistantProfessor`. This is by the way the [state design pattern][3], which prefers [composition over inheritance][4].  Advantage:  The professor may change category without loosing the continuity of his/her identity.Also there is a separation of concerns between the behaviors and properties that are invariant for a professor, and those that change during his/her carrer.&lt;br&gt;Inconvenience: slightly more complex.    \r\n* **Candidate5**:  A class `Professor` refers to a collection of `Role` (or contracts?). Three specializations of of `Role`: `RoleFullProfessor`, `RoleAssociateProfessor`, and `RoleAssistantProfessor`.  For every behavior the Professor forwards the bahavior to all its roles.  &lt;br&gt;Advantage: It can cope with A FullProfessor on field A that is AssistantProfessor on field B.  &lt;br&gt;Inconvenience: it may be overkill if this is not needed.  \r\n\r\nThere are certainly other candidate design as well (I see at least two others).

An\nassistant professor has a minimum number of courses. Full professors,\nassociate professors, and assistant professors can all take an unpaid\nleave. The unpaid leave of an assistant professor should not last more\nthan three months.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have used inheritance to represent the classes:</p>\n<pre><code>class Professor {\n    String title;\n    Department department;\n}\n\nclass AssociateProfessor extends Professor {\n}\n\nclass AssistantProfessor extends Professor {\n}\n\nclass FullProfessor extends Professor{\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>An alternative would be to use an enum for professor type like:</p>\n<pre><code>enum professor {full, associate}` \n</code></pre>\n<p>I am not sure which one is the best approach.<br> Also there are few requirements in the given scenario:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>professor can take a paid leave</li>\n<li>assistant professor has a minimum number of courses</li>\n<li>some professors can take an unpaid leave</li>\n<li>unpaid leave of an assistance professor should not last more than three months</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I am not sure how to represent them in classes.

That explains the &quot;-let&quot; in &quot;Servlet&quot;. \r\n\r\nYour servlet you write plugs into a Servlet container.

And your servlet remains blissfully ignorant as to the existence of web servers. \r\n\r\nSome products, such as Tomcat &amp; Jetty, can be composed of *both* a web server and a Servlet container. \r\n\r\nTomcat is composed mainly of three components: (1) Catalina, a servlet container, (2) Coyote, a web server, and (3) Jasper, a Jakarta Server Pages processor. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Tomcat).\r\n\r\nFor most people&#39;s needs, the *Coyote* web server in Tomcat is a suitable web server.

In such a case, Tomcat’s *Coyote* component goes unused. Instead, the separate web server handles client browser components, and processes incoming requests. If a request is asking for a static resource, the web server serves it out, without any involvement from Tomcat. If the request is asking for work that has been assigned to a servlet, then the separate web server passes the request on to Tomcat and its *Catalina* component. After your servlet produces a response, the response moves from Tomcat back to the external web server, which traffics the response onwards to the client web browser.\r\n\r\n```none\r\n[web request] ➜ [Apache HTTP Server] ➜ [Tomcat Catalina] ➜ [your servlet]\r\n```\r\n\r\n# 4 … embedded vs. non-embedded …\r\n\r\nNon-embedded is the classic situation, as originally envisioned when Servlet technology was first invented. \r\n\r\nBack then, servers were few, expensive, and already in place permanently.

The servlets process the requests, send back a response, which Tomcat then sends back to the client. I suppose in the local setup I have, my machine would both be acting as the client and server.\r\n\r\nGiven the above I want to know:\r\n\r\n 1. How I can directly see and monitor the client&#39;s sending the request to Tomcat and verify that Tomcat has received the request? Essentially, how can I verify that this networking side of things is happening due to some implementation by Tomcat?\r\n 2. How does Tomcat parse the request information and send it to the servlets?\r\n 3. Is Tomcat a servlet container or a web server? Are these the same thing?\r\n 4. In the answer given in the second link regarding embedded vs. non-embedded, the answer states that an embedded server looks like a regular java program. Does this mean that for an embedded server, the server is in the java application while the web application is inside the server in the non-embedded case? Like the containment relationship is **reversed**? What does containment mean in the first place here?\r\n\r\nApologies for the numerous questions and thank you for helping to clarify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7213541/what-is-java-servlet\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23176717/embedded-vs-non-embedded-java-server\r\n  [3]: https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/introduction.html","title":"How can I see what Tomcat is doing with respect to Servlets and the network side","body":"<p>Currently, I am learning about Java web development.</p>\n<p>A lot of it seems to simply be configuration to me, and I feel that my understanding is superficial because I only see the configuration (i.e. define your servlets and their mappings in the web.xml file, make custom Servlets by extending the HttpServlet class, instantiate Tomcat in the main method, etc.)</p>\n<p>I want do know a bit more about what is actually going on under the hood - so I am in some need of some guidance.</p>\n<p>To this end, I have done some cursory reading on Tomcat and servlets from the following links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7213541/what-is-java-servlet\">What is a servlet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23176717/embedded-vs-non-embedded-java-server\">Difference between embedded and not embedded</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/introduction.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tomcat docs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So what I <strong>think</strong> I understand from this is that the servlets sit inside the Tomcat instance (a servlet container) and Tomcat handles all of the receiving all of the requests of the client and relaying them to the servlets. The servlets process the requests, send back a response, which Tomcat then sends back to the client. I suppose in the local setup I have, my machine would both be acting as the client and server.</p>\n<p>Given the above I want to know:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How I can directly see and monitor the client's sending the request to Tomcat and verify that Tomcat has received the request? Essentially, how can I verify that this networking side of things is happening due to some implementation by Tomcat?</li>\n<li>How does Tomcat parse the request information and send it to the servlets?</li>\n<li>Is Tomcat a servlet container or a web server? Are these the same thing?</li>\n<li>In the answer given in the second link regarding embedded vs. non-embedded, the answer states that an embedded server looks like a regular java program. Does this mean that for an embedded server, the server is in the java application while the web application is inside the server in the non-embedded case? Like the containment relationship is <strong>reversed</strong>? What does containment mean in the first place here?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Apologies for the numerous questions and thank you for helping to clarify.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":6095312,"reputation":33135,"user_id":4756299,"display_name":"Andrew Henle"},"score":1,"creation_date":1674404816,"post_id":75202004,"comment_id":132702796,"body_markdown":"Just what do you think the value of `arctan1` is inside your `for (int i = k; i &lt; 100; i++)` look?","body":"Just what do you think the value of <code>arctan1</code> is inside your <code>for (int i = k; i &lt; 100; i++)</code> look?"},{"owner":{"account_id":1485367,"reputation":122993,"user_id":1393766,"display_name":"Pshemo"},"score":2,"creation_date":1674404961,"post_id":75202004,"comment_id":132702823,"body_markdown":"`+` is redundant in `sum =+ arctan1;`.

It will be everything or nothing.\r\n\r\n# Preventing files downloads when a direct link is used\r\n\r\nMore important, to prevent direct linking to your pictures, you can only do this BEFORE PHP is involved to display your website, so ONLY AT THE WEB SERVER level. You need to tell the webserver to forbid any image access not made directly by itself (to display the image of your website). \r\nTo do this you need to play with the webserver configuration file: ***.htaccess*** located at the root level of your standard WordPress installation.\r\n\r\n# Editing .htaccess\r\n\r\n 1. open ***/.htaccess*** \r\n 2. Add the following code before the `#BEGIN Wordpress` line and adapt it with your website domain name knowing that the following code is made for a website located at *www.example.com*. This sample of code is blocking direct downloads of every .txt, .mp4, .jpg and .png files. If you want to make another choice, just change *txt|mp4|jpg|png* in the code: \r\n\r\n        &lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;\r\n\r\n        RewriteEngine On\r\n        RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^https://(www\\.)?example\\.com [NC]\r\n        RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^https://(www\\.)?example\\.com.*$ [NC]\r\n        RewriteRule \\.(txt|mp4|jpg|png)$ - [F]\r\n        # or, much better, less radical, you can replace the last RewriteRule by the following one, to display always the same page or image from your website, changing *https://www.example.com/link-to-page-or-image* to the address of the page or image you&#39;d like to display when someone is trying to download a file using a direct link :\r\n        # RewriteRule \\.(txt|mp4|jpg|png)$ https://www.example.com/link-to-page-or-image [L]\r\n\r\n        &lt;/IfModule&gt;\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n 1. Empty your browser cache.\r\n 2. Try to reach an image of your website entering the direct link to that image in your browser address bar (in WP for example go to your *Media Library*, select any image - a .jpg one if you adapted the previous code to prevent direct downloading of .jpg images - and use the copy button to copy image URL then open a browser new window and paste the copied url in your browser address bar). You should see that the image can&#39;t be downloaded by this way. \r\n 3. Visit to your website : all the images are displayed and every functionalities involving images and direct links (lightbox...) should still be working perfectly because only the webserver has the right to call them.\r\n 4. If the results looks perfect to you, don&#39;t forget to save a copy of the edited ***.htaccess*** file on your desktop for example (removing the dot if your are working on Mac or Linux machine to keep it visible) since Wordpress, in some circumstances, could regenerate that file without the added code. My advice on this point: when you have changed any settings in WP and mainly the some related to permalinks (adding some extensions could also involved ***.htaccess*** edition), take a look at the ***.htaccess*** file&#39;s content to check if the added code is still there... Or add it again.\r\n\r\nEnjoy! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"How to prevent the right click &quot;Save as image&quot; or &quot;open image in New Tab&quot; on wordpress?","body":"<p>The second question - how to disable direct download of any file when you know its url - is a great one!
