It&#39;s also a lot more obvious that you&#39;re traversing twice.\r\n\r\nInstead of traversing an array explicitly:\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i++; i &lt; arr.length())\r\n\r\nUse the implicit for loop:\r\n\r\n    for (String[] value: arr)\r\n\r\nInstead of filling an array explicitly:\r\n\r\n    for (int a = 0; a &lt; arr[i].length; a++) {\r\n        arr[i][a] = &quot;EMPTY&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nUse the already provided fill method:\r\n\r\n    Arrays.fill(value, &quot;EMPTY&quot;);\r\n\r\nInstead of printing an array explicitly:\r\n\r\n    for (String string : strings) {\r\n        System.out.print(string + &quot; &quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    System.out.println();\r\n\r\nUse the already provided print method:\r\n\r\n    for (String[] a : arr)\r\n        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(a));\r\n\r\nHowever, I would have written in functional style:\r\n\r\n    String [][] arr = new String[3][2];\r\n    Arrays.stream(arr)\r\n          .forEach(a -&gt; Arrays.fill(a, &quot;EMPTY&quot;));\r\n    Arrays.stream(arr)\r\n          .map(Arrays::toString)\r\n          .forEach(System.out::println);\r\n\r\nOne particular advantage is that you are encouraged to think in a more abstract way. Instead of thinking how to explicitly set or print each element of the array, you are encouraged to use methods that implicitly traverse, transform or perform generic computations on all elements of the array.","title":"when filling a 2d array it gets null values","body":"<p>Although the answers you have are correct I will add that one problem is your code style is prone to errors.</p>\n<p>Your mistake was traversing the array incorrectly.

Widely referred to as the &quot;People's President&quot;,[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single \n          term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.\n    &lt;/Para&gt;   \n    &lt;Para&gt;\n          While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, \n          aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state \n          honours.\n    &lt;/Para&gt;\n&lt;/data&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","hibernate","mapstruct"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":14194880,"reputation":1483,"user_id":10254476,"display_name":"GJohannes"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1649544399,"creation_date":1649544399,"answer_id":71812484,"question_id":71788571,"body_markdown":"I am not sure that i understand what you want.

When you encounter a token (comma, bracket, digit) you enter a particular state.  Once in a certain state, you can only accept certain other tokens which may put you in a different state or leave you in the current one.  You could have many different states which can accept different tokens and perform different actions.\r\n\r\nFor example.\r\n\r\nWhen you see a digit, the next token may be.\r\n\r\n     1.  Another digit\r\n     2.  A closing bracket.\r\n     3.  A comma.\r\n\r\nEach of those tokens may prompt a different state and/or action.\r\n \r\n     1. Another digit - keep on processing since numbers have many digits.\r\n     2. closing bracket - save the number in a list and get the next list (See below)\r\n     3. comma - save the number and look for next number\r\n\r\nAssuming you want to save all of this in a list of lists it would be easiest to start off with a `List&lt;Object&gt;` since you can save `integers` and `lists of lists` in that type of list with indefinite depths.\r\n\r\nI also suggest you look at the `Stack class`.  You may want to be pushing the current list and popping a recent one as your parsing depth changes.\r\n\r\nFinally, to ensure your brackets are properly matched to the following.

When you encounter a token (comma, bracket, digit) you enter a particular state.  Once in a certain state, you can only accept certain other tokens which may put you in a different state or leave you in the current one.  You could have many different states which can accept different tokens and perform different actions.</p>\n\n<p>For example.</p>\n\n<p>When you see a digit, the next token may be.</p>\n\n<pre><code> 1.  Another digit\n 2.  A closing bracket.\n 3.  A comma.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Each of those tokens may prompt a different state and/or action.</p>\n\n<pre><code> 1. Another digit - keep on processing since numbers have many digits.\n 2. closing bracket - save the number in a list and get the next list (See below)\n 3. comma - save the number and look for next number\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Assuming you want to save all of this in a list of lists it would be easiest to start off with a <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code> since you can save <code>integers</code> and <code>lists of lists</code> in that type of list with indefinite depths.</p>\n\n<p>I also suggest you look at the <code>Stack class</code>.  You may want to be pushing the current list and popping a recent one as your parsing depth changes.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, to ensure your brackets are properly matched to the following.  Increment a counter when you see a '[' and decrement the counter when you see a ']'.  If the counter ever goes negative, you have too many right brackets.  If at the end it is positive, you don't have enough right brackets.</p>\n\n<p>For more on this check out <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Finite State Machines</a> at Wikipedia.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to include a small example of what I was talking about.

I am making an app where a user adds input to a menu by selecting option 1, which I am using a switch statement for. This array needs to be accessible to all of the other switch cases so I have declared it outside of case 1: \r\n\r\n        //Menu loop\r\n        //variable &amp; array declaration\r\n         int myMonths[] = new int[amountOfProjects];\r\n         int index = 0;\r\n\t     int num;\r\n\r\n\t\twhile(choice !=6){ //while option 6 is not chosen keep showing the menu\r\n\r\n           switch (choice){\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tcase 1:\r\n\r\nThe array length is the amount of projects that the user wishes to store in the app. For case 2 I need to display the elements/value of the indeces of the array. If up until this point the user has not entered anything, it should display a message stating this.

No extra mappings required for input validation.  In the example query above, the parameter named *serverId* \r\nwould be checked to make sure it could cast to an integer and was in the range of 0-50.  The parameter *appId* would be processed as an array of integers, with a length limit of 50.  If the field *showOwner* is present and set to &quot;true&quot;, the bits of SQL in the quotes will be added to the generated query for the optional field mappings. field Several more parameter type mappings are available including optional segments of SQL with further parameter mappings.  It allows for as complex of a query mapping as the developer can come up with.  It even has controls in the report configuration to determine whether a given query will have the final mappings via a PreparedStatement or simply ran as a pre-built query.\r\n\r\nFor the sample Http request values:\r\n\r\n    showOwner: true\r\n    serverId: 20\r\n    appId: 1,2,3,5,7,11,13\r\n\r\nIt would produce the following SQL:\r\n\r\n    select app.name as &quot;App&quot;, \r\n           app.owner as &quot;Owner&quot;, \r\n           sv.name as &quot;Server&quot;, sum(act.trans_ct) as &quot;Trans&quot;\r\n      from activity_records act, servers sv, applications app\r\n     where act.server_id = sv.id\r\n       and act.app_id = app.id\r\n       and sv.id = 20\r\n       and app.id in (1,2,3,5,7,11,13)\r\n     group by app.name,  app.owner,  sv.name\r\n     order by app.name, sv.name\r\n\r\n\r\nI really think that Spring or Hibernate or one of those frameworks should offer a more robust mapping mechanism that verifies types, allows for complex data types like arrays and other such features.

It even has controls in the report configuration to determine whether a given query will have the final mappings via a PreparedStatement or simply ran as a pre-built query.</p>\n\n<p>For the sample Http request values:</p>\n\n<pre><code>showOwner: true\nserverId: 20\nappId: 1,2,3,5,7,11,13\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It would produce the following SQL:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select app.name as \"App\", \n       app.owner as \"Owner\", \n       sv.name as \"Server\", sum(act.trans_ct) as \"Trans\"\n  from activity_records act, servers sv, applications app\n where act.server_id = sv.id\n   and act.app_id = app.id\n   and sv.id = 20\n   and app.id in (1,2,3,5,7,11,13)\n group by app.name,  app.owner,  sv.name\n order by app.name, sv.name\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I really think that Spring or Hibernate or one of those frameworks should offer a more robust mapping mechanism that verifies types, allows for complex data types like arrays and other such features.  I wrote my engine for only my purposes, it isn't quite read for general release.  It only works with Oracle queries at the moment and all of the code belongs to a big corporation.  Someday I may take my ideas and build a new open source framework, but I'm hoping one of the existing big players will take up the challenge.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":247217,"reputation":213455,"user_id":521799,"accept_rate":89,"display_name":"Lukas Eder"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":70,"is_accepted":false,"score":70,"last_activity_date":1462727392,"creation_date":1312871634,"answer_id":6992265,"question_id":370818,"body_markdown":"For arbitrary SQL, use [jOOQ][1]. jOOQ currently supports `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `MERGE`.
