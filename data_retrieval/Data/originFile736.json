This seems to have started after moving from javax to jakarta, including updating my classes to use the jakarta namespace instead of the javax namespace, EXCEPT for in the case of javax.servlet, which can't be replaced with jakarta.servlet in any class because it's not found.

So I figured it would make sense to have any other Plot type that uses the core plot functionality to extend Plot. However, I am now realizing that there are many downfalls to this approach. Here is the current basic structure of my code (in java):\n\n    public class Plot {\n        public void doStuff() {\n            // Do stuff for Standard plot type\n        }\n    }\n    \n    public class EstatePlot extends Plot {\n        @Override\n        public void doStuff() {\n            // Make sure we still handle the base functionality (code reuse)\n            super.doStuff();\n            \n            // Make sure we also do stuff specific to the Estate plot type\n        }\n        \n        public void extendedFunctionality() {\n            // Do stuff that only applies to the Estate plot type\n        }\n    }\n\nI do not like this approach for several reasons. \n\n - There are cases where I need to override a method to provide more functionality, but I don&#39;t want to execute all of the code in the parent method.

(ie: the base Plot class may have an undesired effect on any sub-classes behavior because they are tightly coupled. This is known as the fragile base-class problem)\n\nMore reasons why I think this approach is undesireable can be found here ([http://www.javaworld.com/article/2073649/core-java/why-extends-is-evil.html][1])\n\nI thought about using Composition, but I realized that this was not a good option either because I still need to override functionality of the base Plot class.\n\nSo at this point, I know I should use interface inheritance over implementation inheritance. Perhaps I can make Plot an interface that defined the core functionality for all Plot Types (Standard, Estate, Etc.). Now this is where I am stuck because I am faced with the issue of code reuse. I do not want to implement the same standard functionality for all Plot types, so I thought about using a sort of procedure class (lets call it PlotHelper) that defined public static methods to handle a lot of the core functionality given a Plot object. Here is an example:\n\n    public interface Plot {\n        public void doStuff();\n    }\n    \n    public class StandardPlot implements Plot {\n    \n        @Override\n        public void doStuff() {\n            PlotHelper.handleStuff(this);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    public class EstatePlot implements Plot {\n        @Override\n        public void doStuff() {\n            // Make sure we still handle the base functionality (code reuse)\n            PlotHelper.handleStuff(this);\n            \n            // Make sure we also do stuff specific to the Estate plot type\n        }\n        \n        public void extendedFunctionality() {\n            // Do stuff that only applies to the Estate plot type\n        }\n    }\n    \n    public class PlotHelper {\n        public static void handleStuff(Plot plot) {\n            // Do stuff for Standard plot type\n        }\n    }\n\nMy problem with this is that now the core functionality is no longer internalized. The bits and pieced of functionality that is now in the public static methods in PlotHelper used to be handled together in the base Plot class which meant more modular and internalized code. \n\nSo finally, now that you know where and why I am stuck, is there any preferred solution that  avoids implementation inheritance and maintains internalization of type specific code? Or perhaps you can think of a completely different approach that would be great for this case.\n\nThanks for your time!\n\n  [1]: http://www.javaworld.com/article/2073649/core-java/why-extends-is-evil.html","title":"Best way to maximize code reuse while avoiding implementation inheritance and maintaining internalization","body":"<p>I am torn between several different OOP approaches to code reuse and code structure, and I cannot figure out the best option for my case.</p>\n<p>Currently, I have a base class called 'Plot' (a piece of land) which handles the core functionality of a standard plot type and any other plot type.

In that case you need JSTL 1.2. However, you&#39;ve there a `jstl.jar` file while JSTL 1.2 has clearly the version number included like so `jstl-1.2.jar`. The sole filename `jstl.jar` is typical for JSTL 1.0 and 1.1. This version requires a `standard.jar` along in `/WEB-INF/lib` which contains the necessary TLD files. However, in your particular case the `standard.jar` is clearly missing in `/WEB-INF/lib` and that&#39;s exactly the reason why the taglib URI couldn&#39;t be resolved.\r\n\r\nTo solve this you must remove the wrong JAR file, download [jstl-1.2.jar][2] and drop it in its entirety in `/WEB-INF/lib`. That&#39;s all. You do not need to extract it nor to fiddle in project&#39;s *Build Path*.\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t forget to remove that loose `c.tld` file too. It absolutely doesn&#39;t belong there. This is indeed instructed in some poor tutorials or answers elsewhere in the Internet. This is a myth caused by a major misunderstanding and misconfiguration. There is never a need to have a loose JSTL TLD file in the classpath, also not in previous JSTL versions.\r\n\r\nIn case you&#39;re using Maven, use the below coordinate:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: xml --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n        &lt;groupId&gt;javax.servlet&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;jstl&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;version&gt;1.2&lt;/version&gt;\r\n    &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\nYou should also make sure that your `web.xml` is declared conform *at least* Servlet 2.4 and thus not as Servlet 2.3 or older. Otherwise EL expressions inside JSTL tags would in turn fail to work. Pick the highest version matching your target container and make sure that you don&#39;t have a `&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;` anywhere in your `web.xml`.

Another flatMap inside the flatMap repeat, that&#39;s because you cannot do another post call without this workaround as repeat will only repeat what&#39;s inside of the flatMap (not the post call before that but it can do the post call inside it).\r\n3. An AtomicInteger as your index.\r\n4.
