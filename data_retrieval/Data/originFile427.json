How to disable components ability to not make crud dirty?\nI have added my Binder below.</p>\n<pre><code>Binder&lt;Account&gt; binder = new Binder&lt;&gt;(Account.class);\n    binder.forField(nameField).asRequired(&quot;This is mandatory&quot;).withValidator(this::validateForSameNameCarrier, &quot;A carrier with the same name exists&quot;)\n            .withValidator(this::validateForSameNameRoutingClass, &quot;A routing class with the same name exists&quot;)\n            .withValidator(this::validateForSameNameAccounts, &quot;An account or custom carrier group with the same name exists&quot;).bind(Account::getName, Account::setName);\n    binder.forField(disableField).bind(account -&gt; !account.isActive(), (account, disable) -&gt; account.setActive(!disable));\n\n    MixedVerticalLayout layout = new MixedVerticalLayout();\n    layout.getRoot(false).add(nameField, carrierDragDrop, disableField);\n    return new BinderCrudEditor&lt;&gt;(binder, layout);\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","xml","xsd","xml-parsing","xsd-validation"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2183308,"reputation":19305,"user_id":1932311,"display_name":"Yitzhak Khabinsky"},"score":3,"creation_date":1684367320,"post_id":76276766,"comment_id":134509944,"body_markdown":"While asking an XSD question you need to provide a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example):\n(1) Well-formed input XML.\n(2) Your logic, and XSD that tried to implement it.\n(3) XSD processor and its conformance with the XSD standards: 1.0, or 1.1.

Changing the enum check from, for example, <code>CellType.NUMERIC</code> to <code>CellType.NUMERIC.code</code> fixes the cell type conversion issue.</p>\n<p>The <code>practice_id</code>s are now written in the cells as thousands-separated numbers.

All its standard I/O (i.e. stdin, stdout, stderr) operations will be redirected to the parent process, where they can be accessed via the streams obtained using the methods getOutputStream(), getInputStream(), and getErrorStream(). The parent process uses these streams to feed input to and get output from the process.

To keep working I added the jakarta.jms-api-3.1.0.jar from deep within the WildFly modules folder to the Java Build Path (as an External JAR) and changed the source to `import jakarta.jms.*` instead. I think this is not only inefficient though (will have to do so for every such plugin I will need to use), it also requires changing the sources to non-standard package names, and most importantly I&#39;m not sure if and what the server will use at run-time. Searched the Wildfly installation folders and found a file named module.xml, under the C:\\WF28\\modules\\system\\layers\\base\\javax\\jms\\api\\main folder, which contains a module alias:\r\n\r\n    &lt;module-alias name=&quot;javax.jms.api&quot; target-name=&quot;jakarta.jms.api&quot; xmlns=&quot;urn:jboss:module:1.9&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that the server will load the jakarta.jms.api module, if the application requests the javax.jms.api one.\r\n\r\nThe question is how to tell Eclipse to actually use the server configuration (C:\\WF28\\standalone\\configuration\\standalone.xml or standalone-full.xml) for the packages, without having to add the individual .JARs to the Build Path, and using the standard names (eg javax.jms.*).

So I made my Recycler View with my adaptor and I use a GridLayout with span:7 that scrolls Vertically and to change month I added two button (next month,previous month).

or since it depends on Credentials plugin, it would be fine?\nAlso, regarding the security issue that still shows after updating, is it because of what is specified in the Jenkins update center?</p>\n<p>Any help would be appreciated, thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","helidon"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1824964,"reputation":468,"user_id":1658022,"display_name":"Romain Grecourt"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1684372168,"creation_date":1684372168,"answer_id":76277128,"question_id":76270210,"body_markdown":"`io.helidon.config.Config` and `org.eclipse.microprofile.config.Config` are different APIs.\r\n\r\nHelidon provides an implementation of MicroProfile Config with the following Maven dependency `io.helidon.config:helidon-config-mp`.\r\n\r\nYou can create an instance like this:\r\n```\r\norg.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider.getConfig()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHelidon also provides a few SPIs along its implementation of MicroProfile Config, one of which is `io.helidon.config.mp.spi.MpMetaConfigProvider`.\r\n\r\nWhen creating an instance of MicroProfile using the above, implementations of `MpMetaConfigProvider` are used.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHelidon also provides a bridge to create instances of MicroProfile Config backed by `io.helidon.config.Config`.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n// create an instance of &quot;Helidon Config&quot;\r\nio.helidon.config.Config config0 = io.helidon.config.Config.create();\r\n        \r\n// create an instance of &quot;MicroProfile Config&quot; backed by &quot;Helidon Config&quot;\r\norg.eclipse.microprofile.config.Config config =\r\n        ConfigProviderResolver.instance()\r\n                              .getBuilder()\r\n                              .withSources(MpConfigSources.create(config0))\r\n                              .build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code above will NOT use implementations of `MpMetaConfigProvider`.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn order for your code to pickup your implementation of `MpMetaConfigProvider` you can either:\r\n\r\n- Use the built-in main class\r\n- Use `Server.Builder(org.eclipse.microprofile.config.Config)` instead of `Server.Builder(io.helidon.config.Config)` with an instance created using `ConfigProvider.getConfig()`","title":"Not able to set up Custom Config Source in Helidon Mp","body":"<p><code>io.helidon.config.Config</code> and <code>org.eclipse.microprofile.config.Config</code> are different APIs.</p>\n<p>Helidon provides an implementation of MicroProfile Config with the following Maven dependency <code>io.helidon.config:helidon-config-mp</code>.</p>\n<p>You can create an instance like this:</p>\n<pre><code>org.eclipse.microprofile.config.ConfigProvider.getConfig()\n</code></pre>\n<p>Helidon also provides a few SPIs along its implementation of MicroProfile Config, one of which is <code>io.helidon.config.mp.spi.MpMetaConfigProvider</code>.</p>\n<p>When creating an instance of MicroProfile using the above, implementations of <code>MpMetaConfigProvider</code> are used.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Helidon also provides a bridge to create instances of MicroProfile Config backed by <code>io.helidon.config.Config</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>// create an instance of &quot;Helidon Config&quot;\nio.helidon.config.Config config0 = io.helidon.config.Config.create();\n        \n// create an instance of &quot;MicroProfile Config&quot; backed by &quot;Helidon Config&quot;\norg.eclipse.microprofile.config.Config config =\n        ConfigProviderResolver.instance()\n                              .getBuilder()\n                              .withSources(MpConfigSources.create(config0))\n                              .build();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The code above will NOT use implementations of <code>MpMetaConfigProvider</code>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In order for your code to pickup your implementation of <code>MpMetaConfigProvider</code> you can either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the built-in main class</li>\n<li>Use <code>Server.Builder(org.eclipse.microprofile.config.Config)</code> instead of <code>Server.Builder(io.helidon.config.Config)</code> with an instance created using <code>ConfigProvider.getConfig()</code></li>\n</ul>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":16303034,"reputation":13,"user_id":11773621,"display_name":"mystic"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":190,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":76277128,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1684399987,"creation_date":1684313460,"question_id":76270210,"body_markdown":"I have made the changes as suggested in the doc : https://helidon.io/docs/v2/#/mp/config/02_MP_config_sources\r\nBut it is not able to identify the new config source and gives the following error :\r\nConfig source of type test-config-provider is not supported\\`\r\n\r\nHere are the changes that I have done to add the new Custom Config Source :\r\n\r\n1.

I read here: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-java-packages-with-maven that I have to add this but I don&#39;t know what username and password to use except my own. But I want to avoid that.\r\nThe deploy.sh has the following content:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\nOWNER=...\r\nREPOSITORY=...\r\n\r\nfilelist=$(find . -type f -path &quot;*.pom&quot;)\r\nfor file in $filelist\r\ndo\r\n\tdata=$(python getdata.py $file)\r\n\tgroupId=$(echo $data | cut -d&#39; &#39; -f1)\r\n\tartifactId=$(echo $data | cut -d&#39; &#39; -f2)\r\n\tversion=$(echo $data | cut -d&#39; &#39; -f3)\r\n\r\n\tmvn deploy:deploy-file -DgroupId=$groupId -DartifactId=$artifactId -Dversion=$version -Dfile=$file -Durl=https://maven.pkg.github.com/$OWNER/$REPOSITORY\r\ndone\r\n```\r\nIn this case &#39;OWNER&#39; and &#39;REPOSITORY&#39; are purposely empty.\r\n\r\nI already tried to use Actions secrets or Deploy keys but I don&#39;t really understand them and the documentation is not really explaining anything.
