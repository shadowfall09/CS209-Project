I would suggest that you should put the Connection initiation code into a try-with-resources code block so that for each database operation, a connection is established, query operation is performed and the connection is closed within the block. The class to fetch new Connection could look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport java.sql.Connection;\r\nimport java.sql.DriverManager;\r\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\r\n\r\npublic class DatabaseConnection {\r\n\r\n    private static final String DB_URL = &quot;jdbc:mysql://localhost/dbName&quot;;\r\n    private static final String USER = &quot;dbUser&quot;;\r\n    private static final String PASS = &quot;dbPassword&quot;;\r\n\r\n    public static Connection getDatabaseConnection()\r\n    {\r\n        Connection databaseConnection;\r\n        try {\r\n            databaseConnection = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASS);\r\n            \r\n        } catch (SQLException e)\r\n        {\r\n            e.printStackTrace();\r\n        }\r\n        return databaseConnection;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, you can make a call to the static method `DatabaseConnection.getDatabaseConnection()` from any point (controller or other class) of your application to obtain the new Connection instance and use it.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, it would be better to make use of the javafx.concurrency library in case of a JavaFX application. You can utilize the `Task&lt;V&gt;` class like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTask&lt;Void&gt; task = new Task&lt;Void&gt;() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            protected Void call() throws Exception {\r\n\r\n                String query = &quot;SELECT id, first, last, age FROM Employees&quot;;\r\n                try(Connection conn = DatabaseConnection.getDatabaseConnection();\r\n                    Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();\r\n                    ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);) {\r\n                    // Extract data from result set\r\n                    while (rs.next()) {\r\n                        // Retrieve by column name\r\n                        System.out.print(&quot;ID: &quot; + rs.getInt(&quot;id&quot;));\r\n                        System.out.print(&quot;, Age: &quot; + rs.getInt(&quot;age&quot;));\r\n                        System.out.print(&quot;, First: &quot; + rs.getString(&quot;first&quot;));\r\n                        System.out.println(&quot;, Last: &quot; + rs.getString(&quot;last&quot;));\r\n                    }\r\n                } catch (SQLException e) {\r\n                    e.printStackTrace();\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                return null;\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n```\r\nAnd invoking the `Task` by:\r\n\r\n    new Thread(task).start();\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that you should populate all the `ResultSet` data into your own custom non-jdbc classes so that the `ResultSet` class can also be disposed within the block.

The class to fetch new Connection could look like this:</p>\n<pre><code>import java.sql.Connection;\nimport java.sql.DriverManager;\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\n\npublic class DatabaseConnection {\n\n    private static final String DB_URL = &quot;jdbc:mysql://localhost/dbName&quot;;\n    private static final String USER = &quot;dbUser&quot;;\n    private static final String PASS = &quot;dbPassword&quot;;\n\n    public static Connection getDatabaseConnection()\n    {\n        Connection databaseConnection;\n        try {\n            databaseConnection = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASS);\n            \n        } catch (SQLException e)\n        {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n        return databaseConnection;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, you can make a call to the static method <code>DatabaseConnection.getDatabaseConnection()</code> from any point (controller or other class) of your application to obtain the new Connection instance and use it.</p>\n<p>And yes, it would be better to make use of the javafx.concurrency library in case of a JavaFX application. You can utilize the <code>Task&lt;V&gt;</code> class like:</p>\n<pre><code>Task&lt;Void&gt; task = new Task&lt;Void&gt;() {\n            @Override\n            protected Void call() throws Exception {\n\n                String query = &quot;SELECT id, first, last, age FROM Employees&quot;;\n                try(Connection conn = DatabaseConnection.getDatabaseConnection();\n                    Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();\n                    ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);) {\n                    // Extract data from result set\n                    while (rs.next()) {\n                        // Retrieve by column name\n                        System.out.print(&quot;ID: &quot; + rs.getInt(&quot;id&quot;));\n                        System.out.print(&quot;, Age: &quot; + rs.getInt(&quot;age&quot;));\n                        System.out.print(&quot;, First: &quot; + rs.getString(&quot;first&quot;));\n                        System.out.println(&quot;, Last: &quot; + rs.getString(&quot;last&quot;));\n                    }\n                } catch (SQLException e) {\n                    e.printStackTrace();\n                }\n\n                return null;\n            }\n        };\n</code></pre>\n<p>And invoking the <code>Task</code> by:</p>\n<pre><code>new Thread(task).start();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that you should populate all the <code>ResultSet</code> data into your own custom non-jdbc classes so that the <code>ResultSet</code> class can also be disposed within the block. Furthermore, you should also consider applying Transaction Management to your code containing Database Operations (in case your application is concurrently making many database calls from different points/classes) for data consistency.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"display_name":"user20774904"},"comment_count":13,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":167,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"closed_date":1673974346,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1673950632,"creation_date":1673927868,"question_id":75141866,"body_markdown":"I am working on a JavaFX project that connects to a MySQL database (and as such I use a JDBC [java.sql] to perform various tasks from java to SQL).

If the two differ, then the operation `Integer.compare(getOrder(o1), getOrder(o2))`&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; determines the comparison.

Otherwise, you should extract the sort key first:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>Collections.sort(myList, myRules.thenComparing(Comparator.comparing(t -&gt; t.aString)));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the actual specific numbers returned don't matter, what matters is that lower numbers come before higher numbers when sorting, so if one would always put the string &quot;Hi&quot; first, then the corresponding number should be the lowest returned (in my case 0).</p>\n<h3>Using Java &lt;= 7 features (Android API level 21 compatible)</h3>\n<p>If Java 8 features are not available to you, then you could implement it like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>Comparator&lt;MyClass&gt; myRules = new Comparator&lt;MyClass&gt;() {\n\n    @Override\n    public int compare(MyClass o1, MyClass o2) {\n        int order = Integer.compare(getOrder(o1), getOrder(o2));\n        return (order != 0 ? order : o1.aString.compareTo(o2.aString));\n    }\n\n    private int getOrder(MyClass m) {\n        if (m.aString.equals(&quot;Hi&quot;)) {\n            return 0;\n        }\n        else if (m.aString.startsWith(&quot; &quot;)) {\n            return 1;\n        }\n        else {\n            return 2;\n        }\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>And call it like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>Collections.sort(list, myRules);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This works as follows: first, both received strings are mapped to your custom ruleset and subtracted from eachother. If the two differ, then the operation <code>Integer.compare(getOrder(o1), getOrder(o2))</code><sup>1</sup> determines the comparison. Otherwise, if both are the same, then the lexiographic order is used for comparison.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ideone.com/BbEOHb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here is some code in action</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup><sup>1</sup> Always use <code>Integer::compare</code> rather than subtracting one from the other, because of the risk of erroneous results due to integer overflow. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2728793/java-integer-compareto-why-use-comparison-vs-subtraction\">See here</a>.</sup></p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1548079,"reputation":128727,"user_id":1441122,"display_name":"Stuart Marks"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"is_accepted":false,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1548110276,"creation_date":1548110276,"answer_id":54298721,"question_id":54224267,"body_markdown":"The [answer][1] from MC Emperor is quite nice (+1) in that it fulfills the OP&#39;s requirement of not using Java 8 APIs.

They are not fixed, they slide. This means that they will be triggered even for t &lt; x.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, there is no out of the box support for what you are trying to do. What I&#39;ve done in the past, is to manually create a &quot;bucket&quot; fact to collect events and then to write rules using these buckets instead of the individual events.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**Edit after OP&#39;s comment.**\r\n\r\nSome clarifications about Sliding Windows in Drools:\r\n\r\n - Time Sliding Windows in Drools will not wait whatever size they have been configured with before fire. For example a window like `window:time (10s)` should be interpreted as ` 0s &lt;= t &lt;= 10s`. If you have events coming every 1s, the window will be executed at `t=1`, `t=2`, `t=3`, ..., `t=n`.\r\n - Sliding Windows in Drools are not discrete. They are not fixed buckets of time/size. As an example, let&#39;s suppose we have this timed window: `window:time (3s)`. And let&#39;s assume we have events (`e`) coming every 1s.

They are not fixed, they slide. This means that they will be triggered even for t &lt; x.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I know, there is no out of the box support for what you are trying to do. What I've done in the past, is to manually create a \"bucket\" fact to collect events and then to write rules using these buckets instead of the individual events.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit after OP's comment.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some clarifications about Sliding Windows in Drools:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Time Sliding Windows in Drools will not wait whatever size they have been configured with before fire. For example a window like <code>window:time (10s)</code> should be interpreted as <code>0s &lt;= t &lt;= 10s</code>. If you have events coming every 1s, the window will be executed at <code>t=1</code>, <code>t=2</code>, <code>t=3</code>, ..., <code>t=n</code>.</li>\n<li>Sliding Windows in Drools are not discrete. They are not fixed buckets of time/size. As an example, let's suppose we have this timed window: <code>window:time (3s)</code>. And let's assume we have events (<code>e</code>) coming every 1s. The window will be executed as follows: <code>t(1):[e1]</code>, <code>t(2):[e1,e2]</code>, <code>t(3):[e1,e2,e3]</code>, <code>t(4):[e2,e3,e4]</code>, <code>t(5):[e3,e4,e5]</code>.

The following code does not actually optimize memory consumption:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString hql = &quot;select xaction from Xaction xaction&quot;;\r\nQuery&lt;Xaction&gt; query = session.createQuery(hql, Xaction.class);\r\nquery.setFetchSize(100);\r\nquery.setReadOnly(true);\r\nquery.setLockMode(&quot;xaction&quot;, LockMode.NONE);\r\nScrollableResults results = query.scroll(ScrollMode.FORWARD_ONLY);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince you are retrieving full-functional entities, those entities get stored in persistence context (session-level cache), and in order to free memory up you need to detach entity upon entity has been processed (i.e. after `xactionsBatch.add(xaction)` or `// ... create xp based off Xaction info ...`), otherwise at the end of processing you consume the same amount of memory as you were doing `List&lt;&gt; results = query.getResultList();`, and here I&#39;m not sure what is better: consume all memory required at the start of transaction and release all other resources or keep cursor and jdbc connection open for 4 hours.\r\n\r\n2. The following code does not actually optimize JDBC interactions:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    for (Xaction xaction : xactionBatch) {\r\n        try {\r\n            XactionParticipant xp = new XactionParticipant();\r\n            // ... create xp based off Xaction info ...\r\n\r\n            // Use native query for efficiency\r\n            String nativeQueryStr = &quot;INSERT INTO XactionParticipant .... xp info/data&quot;;\r\n            Query q = em.createNativeQuery(nativeQueryStr);\r\n            q.executeUpdate();\r\n        } catch (Exception e) {\r\n            log.error(&quot;Unable to update&quot;, e);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nyes, in general, JDBC should be faster than JPA API, however that is not your case - you are inserting records one-by-one instead of using batch inserts. In order to take advantage of batches your code should look like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)\r\npublic void commitBatch(List&lt;Xaction&gt; xactionBatch) {\r\n    session.doWork(connection -&gt; {\r\n        String insert = &quot;INSERT INTO XactionParticipant VALUES (?, ?, ...)&quot;;\r\n        try (PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement(insert)) {\r\n            for (Xaction xaction : xactionBatch) {\r\n                ps.setString(1, &quot;val1&quot;);\r\n                ps.setString(2, &quot;val2&quot;);\r\n                ps.addBatch();\r\n                ps.clearParameters();\r\n            }\r\n            ps.executeBatch();\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBTW, Hibernate may do the same if `hibernate.jdbc.batch_size` is set to large enough positive integer and entities are properly designed (id generation is backed up by DB sequence and allocationSize is large enough)","title":"How to properly / efficiently manage entity manager JPA Spring @Transactional for large datasets?","body":"<p>That is not clear what is the root cause of your performance problem: java memory consumption or db performance, please check some thoughts below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The following code does not actually optimize memory consumption:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>String hql = &quot;select xaction from Xaction xaction&quot;;\nQuery&lt;Xaction&gt; query = session.createQuery(hql, Xaction.class);\nquery.setFetchSize(100);\nquery.setReadOnly(true);\nquery.setLockMode(&quot;xaction&quot;, LockMode.NONE);\nScrollableResults results = query.scroll(ScrollMode.FORWARD_ONLY);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since you are retrieving full-functional entities, those entities get stored in persistence context (session-level cache), and in order to free memory up you need to detach entity upon entity has been processed (i.e. after <code>xactionsBatch.add(xaction)</code> or <code>// ... create xp based off Xaction info ...</code>), otherwise at the end of processing you consume the same amount of memory as you were doing <code>List&lt;&gt; results = query.getResultList();</code>, and here I'm not sure what is better: consume all memory required at the start of transaction and release all other resources or keep cursor and jdbc connection open for 4 hours.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The following code does not actually optimize JDBC interactions:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>    for (Xaction xaction : xactionBatch) {\n        try {\n            XactionParticipant xp = new XactionParticipant();\n            // ... create xp based off Xaction info ...\n\n            // Use native query for efficiency\n            String nativeQueryStr = &quot;INSERT INTO XactionParticipant .... xp info/data&quot;;\n            Query q = em.createNativeQuery(nativeQueryStr);\n            q.executeUpdate();\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            log.error(&quot;Unable to update&quot;, e);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>yes, in general, JDBC should be faster than JPA API, however that is not your case - you are inserting records one-by-one instead of using batch inserts.

This will work with multiple names:</p>\n<pre><code>StringBuilder initials = new StringBuilder(new String());\nString[] individualNames = name.split(&quot; &quot;);\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; individualNames.length; i++) {\n  initials.append(individualNames[i].substring(0, 1) + &quot;. &quot;);\n}\nSystem.out.println(initials);\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":23269252,"reputation":13,"user_id":18367361,"display_name":"comingundone"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":206,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":75142709,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1673937221,"creation_date":1673928942,"question_id":75141939,"body_markdown":"University computer science major here.
