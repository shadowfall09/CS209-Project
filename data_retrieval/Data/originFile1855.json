The program features 3 classes: one which provides the get and set methods for each student (`Student`), one that provides four different options from which the teachers can choose (`Communicator`), and a class which calls the `Communicator` class to start up (`HW4`). The four options in the `Communicator` class include 1) loading lists of students using text files, 2) displaying students with a GPA higher than the GPA entered by the user, 3) printing a loaded log of files that have been loaded into the program, and 4) exit the program. \r\n\r\nI have all the basic parts of each program working. However, I&#39;m having difficulty with the program recognizing if a file has already been loaded, to which it should reply &quot;File already loaded!&quot; Each file loaded into the program is added to a TreeSet called &quot;logHistory,&quot; and I tried using an if statement that basically will print out that the file has already been loaded if the log history contains the input.

The program features 3 classes: one which provides the get and set methods for each student (<code>Student</code>), one that provides four different options from which the teachers can choose (<code>Communicator</code>), and a class which calls the <code>Communicator</code> class to start up (<code>HW4</code>). The four options in the <code>Communicator</code> class include 1) loading lists of students using text files, 2) displaying students with a GPA higher than the GPA entered by the user, 3) printing a loaded log of files that have been loaded into the program, and 4) exit the program.</p>\n<p>I have all the basic parts of each program working. However, I'm having difficulty with the program recognizing if a file has already been loaded, to which it should reply &quot;File already loaded!&quot; Each file loaded into the program is added to a TreeSet called &quot;logHistory,&quot; and I tried using an if statement that basically will print out that the file has already been loaded if the log history contains the input. However, it simply prints out &quot;[text file] loaded successfully! File already loaded!&quot; even if I've already entered it once.

This is simply a JVM limitation. Private is private is private.\r\n\r\n## What you can do instead\r\n\r\n### 1. Use native AspectJ\r\n\r\nIf you use native AspectJ, there are no more proxies. The code is woven directly into the original byte code. If done right, you can intercept private methods.\r\n\r\nBut why would you want to measure private method runtimes? You should focus on measuring public ones, because those are the ones that count from a user&#39;s perspective. For internal optimisations, rather use a profiler.\r\n\r\n### 2. Make private methods (package-)protected\r\n\r\nIf you make your target methods at least `protected`, they can be called by subclasses, i.e. also by dynamic proxies. But in order to do it right you need to\r\n\r\n  * `@Autowire MyComponent INSTANCE` into the target class,\r\n  * change your formerly private, now protected method calls from simply `internalMethod()` or `this.internalMethod()` to `INSTANCE.internalMethod()` in order to enable the calls to be intercepted by Spring AOP aspects,\r\n  * make sure to use CGLIB proxies and not JDK dynamic proxies. Spring Boot does that by default, even for beans wired as interfaces and not as implementing classes. Spring Core however defaults to JDK proxies for beans created using a call like `appContext.getBean(MyInterface.class)`. So you need to activate target class auto-proxying in that case. The reason is that interfaces by design only have public methods, i.e. protected methods are not implemented by the proxy and therefore cannot be called upon it.\r\n\r\nThis will work, and making the methods protected also documents that they are meant to be used by subclasses. Auto-wiring the proxy instance into the target class is ugly IMO, however, because it makes the target class AOP-aware. Actually, aspects are cross-cutting concerns and the target class should be agnostic of them and work without any extra gymnastics.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is the same as the Spring manual&#39;s: If you absolutely believe you need self-invocation support for aspects, use native AspectJ.\r\n\r\n### 3. Factor out private methods into public methods of an extra component\r\n\r\nThe cleanest solution, if you absolutely want to stick with Spring AOP and want to avoid auto-wiring the proxy into the target class, is to create a separate Spring bean/component, exposing the formerly private methods as public ones there, wiring that helper component into your original target class and call the methods from component A to B. Then Spring AOP aspects just work. If it makes sense to expose the formerly private methods like that, is a design decision which can only be made on a case-by-case basis. If you had good reasons to hide the methods from your API before, then probably the answer is no. Otherwise, it might be yes. Making your components more fine-granular might even be beneficial, if the newly extracted component could also be used by other classes.","title":"Alternatives to &quot;private&quot; helper methods in Java Spring Boot application","body":"<h2>Why it does not work the way you expect</h2>\n<p>Before you created this question, you already commented on my answer <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/56616248/1082681\">here</a>, i.e. you already know how Spring proxies work internally:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The proxy is a subclass of the target object's class, implementing the same interfaces as that class (if any).</li>\n<li>The proxy internally holds a reference to the target object and delegates intercepted method calls to it (unless the aspect decides not to call the original method).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyway, completely unrelated to dynamic proxies is the fact that in Java, <strong><code>private</code> methods can only be called by the original declaring class,</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>not by subclasses (for that we use <code>protected</code>),</li>\n<li>not by other classes in the same package (for that we use package-protected),</li>\n<li>not by unrelated classes in other packages (for that we use <code>public</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, with the proxy being both a subclass instance and an outside object, you see that it is impossible that you can call a parent class's private method upon the proxy, i.e. even if you would auto-wire the proxy into the target class and then try to call <code>PROXY.privateMethod()</code>, it would not work, with or without Spring AOP.

This would be in contrast to events that are driven by natural time, such as a rocket launch.\r\n\r\nTo store such appointments, you need *three* columns in your database:\r\n\r\n - Intended time zone. If your database lacks a data type for this, use a textual column to store [real time zone names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) in format of `Continent/Region` such as `America/New_York` or `Africa/Casablanca`. \r\n - `TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE`, to store the date and time-of-day of the appointment but without the context of a [time zone][2] or [offset-from-UTC][3]. \r\n - A duration, for how long the appointment will last. If your database lacks a data type for this, store text in standard [ISO 8601 durations][4] format: `PnYnMnDTnHnMnS`. For example, one and a half hours would be `PT1H30M`. \r\n\r\n## Time zones change\r\n\r\nWe cannot store a moment, a specific point on the timeline, for appointments because we never know when politicians will change the offset used for the time zone(s) in their jurisdiction. Politicians around the world have shown a predilection for changing their time zone rules. They do so surprisingly often, and with little or even no warning. So we programmers must always assume future changes to our time zone rules.\r\n\r\nWhen determining a schedule, such as your desired query, we must dynamically determine a moment for each appointment. We must craft the query to convert each appointment row’s stored values into a a dynamically calculated moment. \r\n\r\n - For the start of the appointment, we take the `TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE` value, apply the row&#39;s time zone, to get a moment, a `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` value.\r\n - For the end of the appointment, we take that generated `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` value and add to it the row’s duration value.\r\n\r\n## SQL\r\n\r\nYou may be able to craft such a query if your database offers robust date-time handling facilities. \r\n\r\n## Java\r\n\r\nIf your database lacks robust date-time handling facilities, then bring the data into Java to be processed and filtered.\r\n\r\nDefine a class to represent each row. Here we use a [`record`][5]. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nrecord Appointment ( UUID uuid , ZoneId zoneId , LocalDateTime start , Duration duration ) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRetrieve the data, and collect.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList&lt; Appointment &gt; appointments = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;() ;\r\n…\r\nUUID uuid = myResultSet.getObject( … , UUID.class ) ;\r\nZoneID zoneId = ZoneId.of( myResultSet.getString( … ) ) ;\r\nLocalDateTime start = myResultSet.getObject( … , LocalDateTime.class ) ;\r\nDuration duration = Duration.parse( myResultSet.getString( … ) ) ;\r\nappointments.add( new Appointment( uuid , zoneId , start , duration ) ) ;\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefine the target start and end of your search. Generally best to use Half-Open approach to defining a span-of-time. In Half-Open, the beginning is *inclusive* while the ending is *exclusive*. This provides for neatly abutting spans, and other benefits.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nZonedDateTime zdtStart = ZonedDateTime.of( 2022 , Month.JANUARY , 23 , 15 , 30 , 0 , 0 , ZoneId.of( &quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot; ) ) ;\r\nZonedDateTime zdtEnd = zdtStart.plusHours( 2 ) ;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdjust those to UTC (an offset of zero hour-minutes-seconds) by extracting an `Instant`.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nInstant targetStart = zdtStart.toInstant() ;\r\nInstant targetEnd = zdtEnd.toInstant() ;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could code the logic yourself for asking if an appointment overlaps the target span-of-time. But I find it easier to use the [`Interval`][6] class found in the [*ThreeTen-Extra*][7] library.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nInterval target = Interval.of( targetStart , targetEnd ) ;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we can loop our list of `Appointment` objects, to compare each against our target.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList&lt; Appointment &gt; hits = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;() ;\r\nfor( Appointment appointment : appointments ) \r\n{\r\n    ZonedDateTime start = appointment.start().atZone( appointment.zoneId() ) ;\r\n    ZonedDateTime stop = start.plus( appointment.duration() ) ;\r\n    Interval appointmentInterval = Interval.of( start , stop ) ;\r\n    if( appointmentInterval.overlaps( target ) )\r\n    {\r\n        hits.add( appointment ) ;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nreturn List.copyOf( hits ) ;  // Return an unmodifiable list, as a generally good habit. \r\n```\r\n\r\nReminder: Your host operating system, database engine, and Java implementation likely each have their own copy of the time zone rules ([*tzdata*][8], usually).

This would be in contrast to events that are driven by natural time, such as a rocket launch.</p>\n<p>To store such appointments, you need <em>three</em> columns in your database:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intended time zone. If your database lacks a data type for this, use a textual column to store <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">real time zone names</a> in format of <code>Continent/Region</code> such as <code>America/New_York</code> or <code>Africa/Casablanca</code>.</li>\n<li><code>TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE</code>, to store the date and time-of-day of the appointment but without the context of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">time zone</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC_offset\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">offset-from-UTC</a>.</li>\n<li>A duration, for how long the appointment will last. If your database lacks a data type for this, store text in standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ISO 8601 durations</a> format: <code>PnYnMnDTnHnMnS</code>. For example, one and a half hours would be <code>PT1H30M</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Time zones change</h2>\n<p>We cannot store a moment, a specific point on the timeline, for appointments because we never know when politicians will change the offset used for the time zone(s) in their jurisdiction. Politicians around the world have shown a predilection for changing their time zone rules. They do so surprisingly often, and with little or even no warning. So we programmers must always assume future changes to our time zone rules.</p>\n<p>When determining a schedule, such as your desired query, we must dynamically determine a moment for each appointment. We must craft the query to convert each appointment row’s stored values into a a dynamically calculated moment.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the start of the appointment, we take the <code>TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE</code> value, apply the row's time zone, to get a moment, a <code>TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE</code> value.</li>\n<li>For the end of the appointment, we take that generated <code>TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE</code> value and add to it the row’s duration value.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>SQL</h2>\n<p>You may be able to craft such a query if your database offers robust date-time handling facilities.</p>\n<h2>Java</h2>\n<p>If your database lacks robust date-time handling facilities, then bring the data into Java to be processed and filtered.</p>\n<p>Define a class to represent each row. Here we use a <a href=\"https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/395\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>record</code></a>.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>record Appointment ( UUID uuid , ZoneId zoneId , LocalDateTime start , Duration duration ) {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Retrieve the data, and collect.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>List&lt; Appointment &gt; appointments = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;() ;\n…\nUUID uuid = myResultSet.getObject( … , UUID.class ) ;\nZoneID zoneId = ZoneId.of( myResultSet.getString( … ) ) ;\nLocalDateTime start = myResultSet.getObject( … , LocalDateTime.class ) ;\nDuration duration = Duration.parse( myResultSet.getString( … ) ) ;\nappointments.add( new Appointment( uuid , zoneId , start , duration ) ) ;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Define the target start and end of your search. Generally best to use Half-Open approach to defining a span-of-time. In Half-Open, the beginning is <em>inclusive</em> while the ending is <em>exclusive</em>. This provides for neatly abutting spans, and other benefits.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>ZonedDateTime zdtStart = ZonedDateTime.of( 2022 , Month.JANUARY , 23 , 15 , 30 , 0 , 0 , ZoneId.of( &quot;America/Los_Angeles&quot; ) ) ;\nZonedDateTime zdtEnd = zdtStart.plusHours( 2 ) ;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Adjust those to UTC (an offset of zero hour-minutes-seconds) by extracting an <code>Instant</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>Instant targetStart = zdtStart.toInstant() ;\nInstant targetEnd = zdtEnd.toInstant() ;\n</code></pre>\n<p>You could code the logic yourself for asking if an appointment overlaps the target span-of-time. But I find it easier to use the <a href=\"https://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/Interval.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Interval</code></a> class found in the <a href=\"https://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>ThreeTen-Extra</em></a> library.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>Interval target = Interval.of( targetStart , targetEnd ) ;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we can loop our list of <code>Appointment</code> objects, to compare each against our target.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>List&lt; Appointment &gt; hits = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;() ;\nfor( Appointment appointment : appointments ) \n{\n    ZonedDateTime start = appointment.start().atZone( appointment.zoneId() ) ;\n    ZonedDateTime stop = start.plus( appointment.duration() ) ;\n    Interval appointmentInterval = Interval.of( start , stop ) ;\n    if( appointmentInterval.overlaps( target ) )\n    {\n        hits.add( appointment ) ;\n    }\n}\nreturn List.copyOf( hits ) ;  // Return an unmodifiable list, as a generally good habit. \n</code></pre>\n<p>Reminder: Your host operating system, database engine, and Java implementation likely each have their own copy of the time zone rules (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>tzdata</em></a>, usually).

Change your server&#39;s data encoding from *UTF-16* to *UTF-8*.          **WHY?** Data transmission between any endpoints relies on the `consistency`, that is, data encoding for server/client applications. While your server (`ServerSocketConnection`) is sending messages encoded with *UTF-16*, your client (`__socket_reading_no_server`) is receiving messages with *UTF-8*. Even though your client is capable of receiving all the messages from the server, it cannot recognize them at all. For example, *UTF-16* encodes string `&quot;5&quot;` into bytes `[0,53]`, for *UTF-8* the result is `[53]` (assuming big-endian byte ordering). Refer to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16) for more details.\r\n2. Do not use `out.newLine()`. Use `out.write(&quot;\\r\\n&quot;)` instead.       **WHY?** `newline()`&#39;s behavior is platform-dependent, which results in returning one or two characters, for Unix-like OS or Windows OS, respectively. It relies on a `line.separator` system property, you can refer to [Java doc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/BufferedWriter.html) for more details.\r\n3. Your `data = s.recv(4)` put a constraint that you client reads at most 4 bytes at a time, which is dangerous.    **WHY?** Since according to  [Python doc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket.recv), your `4` is not the actual number of bytes that client received, but *the maximum amount of data to be received*. Furthermore, the client would be theoretically only able to receive up to 9999 bytes (byte1~4: `&#39;9&#39;`) of the next incoming message.\r\n\r\n---\r\nFor your question **&quot;...instruction that blocks while sending the...&quot;**: Unfortunately, there are no error messages provided here, and we cannot precisely deduce which part of the whole thing went wrong. However, we can infer that, it is more likely the consequence of Java&#39;s implementation for network socket, since the situation you encountered is probably rather uncommon in C network programming (i.e., raw sockets), that is, *blocking* won&#39;t happen during the continuous transmission of bytes, according to [POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/functions/write.html) definitions for `write` system call (note that most high-level languages eventually invoke `write` system call to send bytes) :\r\n\r\n&gt; Upon successful completion, write() and pwrite() shall **return** the number of bytes actually written to the file associated with fildes. This number shall never be greater than nbyte. Otherwise, -1 shall be **returned** and errno set to indicate the error.\r\n\r\nThat is, after invoking `write` to send bytes to stream buffer, it would just *return something*, instead of *blocking*. \r\n\r\nThe Java implementation for network socket is rather sophisticated,  and this is definitely not Java&#39;s fault. In fact, if we could use sockets properly, then the obscure errors will disappear. For example, according to my tests, after applying the following corrections, your application **works just fine**:  \r\n\r\n---\r\n**Codes Corrections:**  \r\n1. `ServerSocketConnection`  /  `byte[] ptext = message.getBytes(&quot;UTF-16&quot;);` -&gt; ` byte[] ptext = message.getBytes(&quot;UTF-8&quot;);`\r\n2. `ServerSocketConnection` / `send(String.valueOf(ptext.length));` -&gt; `send(String.format(&quot;%2d&quot;,ptext.length));`\r\n3. `ServerSocketConnection` / `out.newLine()` -&gt; `out.write(&quot;\\r\\n&quot;)`\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Tests**:  \r\n\r\nserver:  \r\n```java\r\nBlockingQueue&lt;String&gt; q = new ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;String&gt;(20);\r\nq.add(&quot;str 1&quot;);\r\nq.add(&quot;str 2&quot;);\r\nq.add(&quot;str 3&quot;);\r\n```\r\n```java\r\nserverSocketConnection.sendMessage(element);\r\nlogger.info(&quot;element:&quot;+element);  // debug\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\n########################################################## Server Outputs  \r\nNov 11, 2021 11:05:51 PM SendToPlatform socketSender\r\nINFO: element:str 1\r\nNov 11, 2021 11:05:51 PM SendToPlatform socketSender\r\nINFO: element:str 2\r\nNov 11, 2021 11:05:51 PM SendToPlatform socketSender\r\nINFO: element:str 3\r\n```\r\nclient: \r\n```python\r\nprint(&quot;message: %s&quot; % message)   # debug\r\n# queue_input.put(message)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n########################################################## Client Outputs\r\nmessage: str 1\r\nmessage: str 2\r\nmessage: str 3\r\n```\r\n  \r\n \r\n---\r\n**EDITS :**\r\n\r\nOne more thing I want to emphasis is that although we don&#39;t actually know what your application gonna do, the simple length-based message transmission is possible through network sockets.

The pending message gets released when I close the socket connection. I tried using `PrintWriter` and `DataOutputStream` instead of `BufferedWriter,` but the same problem occurred. I tried not sending the length of the message before sending the string to adapt the `s.recv()` size, but the same problem occurred. \r\nI&#39;m new to socket programming, and probably I did something incredibly wrong, but I cannot find where the problem is. Maybe is there a better way to pass data between processes that I&#39;m unaware of that I can use for my needs instead of sockets?\r\n\r\nEdits after @absuu answer\r\n-----------------\r\nAfter applying the corrections suggested in the answer I still get the same problem of `out.write` in the send method blocking while trying to write into the socket. I edited my code as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class ServerSocketConnection {\r\n    [...]\r\n    public void sendMessage(String message) {\r\n        try {\r\n            send(message);\r\n        } catch (IOException e) {\r\n            logger.severe(&quot;Error sending message:&quot; + e.getMessage());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void send(String message) throws IOException {\r\n        message += &quot;\\r\\n&quot;;\r\n        byte[] ptext = message.getBytes(&quot;UTF-8&quot;);\r\n        out.write(String.format(&quot;%2d&quot;,ptext.length));\r\n        out.write(&quot;\\r\\n&quot;);\r\n        out.flush();\r\n        out.write(new String(ptext));\r\n        logger.info(&quot;Data sent&quot;);\r\n        out.flush();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI also increased the `s.recv` size but nothing changed\r\n","title":"Socket blocks sending messages between a Java server and Python client","body":"<p>I need to pass some strings of data between a Java application and a python script on a local Windows machine.
