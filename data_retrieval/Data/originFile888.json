Are you implementing the Builder Pattern?\r\n2. Are you using any framework which provides the builder pattern for you?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1. If you are implementing the builder pattern you can initialize inside the `StudentBuilder` class this way:\r\n```\r\nclass Student {\r\n    private final int id;\r\n    private Boolean isPresent = Boolean.FALSE;\r\n\r\n    Student(int id, Boolean isPresent) {\r\n        this.id = id;\r\n        this.isPresent = isPresent;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static StudentBuilder builder() {\r\n        return new StudentBuilder();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static class StudentBuilder {\r\n        private int id;\r\n        private Boolean isPresent = Boolean.FALSE;\r\n\r\n        StudentBuilder() {\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public StudentBuilder id(int id) {\r\n            this.id = id;\r\n            return this;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public StudentBuilder isPresent(Boolean isPresent) {\r\n            this.isPresent = isPresent;\r\n            return this;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public Student build() {\r\n            return new Student(id, isPresent);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public String toString() {\r\n            return &quot;Student.StudentBuilder(id=&quot; + this.id + &quot;, isPresent=&quot; + this.isPresent + &quot;)&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\n2. if you are using any framework like Lombok for the builder pattern,\r\n\r\n    You can replace the Boxed data type with primitive data types:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    class Student {\r\n        private int id;\r\n        private boolean isPresent;  //default is false.\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    That will also result in the `false`\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEdit: Alternatively you can check for Null in the constructor and implement the logic by yourself. \r\n\r\nLike:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Getter\r\n@Builder\r\nclass Student {\r\n    private int id;\r\n    private Boolean isPresent;\r\n\r\n    private Student(int id, Boolean isPresent) {\r\n        this.id = id;\r\n        this.isPresent = isPresent;\r\n        if (this.isPresent == null) {\r\n            this.isPresent = false;\r\n        }    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: When using the `builder` pattern you want to **make the object as immutable after the `build`**.

The parent class is not supposed be modified.\r\n2. The variable in the parent class is private as mentioned.\r\n\r\nBased on the above, since the variable is declared private, it cannot be inherited by a subclass i.e. there will not be any copy of the variable accessible to the subclass&#39;s object.

Second, you&#39;re trying to get 2 lines of input within your loop, you wait for the user to input an integer, then you try to parse that integer with `input.next()`. Afterwards, you call `input.next()` again to check if the user wants to quit.

By calling <code>next()</code> twice, you're requiring the user to input 2 lines, causing the issue you were describing.</p>\n<p>You can fix this by calling <code>next()</code> once and storing its return value in a variable, then check if it equals q for quit, otherwise you can parse an integer value from it.</p>\n<p>Here is working code that applies fixes to these issues:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        while(true) {\n            System.out.println(&quot;Enter in a movie number:&quot;);\n            // Get user input\n            String input = scanner.next();\n\n            // If the input equals q, we break out of the loop\n            if(input.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;q&quot;)) break;\n            \n            int intInput;\n            try {\n                // Get integer input\n                intInput = Integer.parseInt(input);\n            } catch(NumberFormatException e) { // Input was not a number\n                System.out.println(&quot;Invalid, must input a number&quot;);\n                continue;\n            }\n            \n            if(intInput &lt; 0) {\n                System.out.println(&quot;Invalid, no negative numbers&quot;);\n                continue;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also, a small note, instead of using <code>Object.equals</code> to check if two strings are equal you can just use the equals method inside of the <code>String</code> class like so: <code>str1.equals(str2)</code>.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":26871579,"reputation":11,"user_id":20453486,"display_name":"JackofSpades"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":78,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1668402627,"creation_date":1668373174,"question_id":74424722,"body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been trying to make a while loop where I enter in a movie number until the user types &#39;q&#39; for quit, but every time I enter a valid number, I have to enter it twice before it prompts me with the &quot;Enter movie number&quot; message again.

In March 2014, `java.time` API supplanted the [error-prone legacy date-time API](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/jf14-date-time.html). Since then, it is strongly recommended to use this modern date-time API.\r\n\r\nWays to get yesterday&#39;s date:\r\n--\r\n\r\nThere are three ways:\r\n\r\n 1. [`LocalDate#minusDays(long daysToSubtract)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDate.html#minusDays-long-)\r\n 2. [`LocalDate#minus(long amountToSubtract, TemporalUnit unit)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDate.html#minus-long-java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit-): It has got some additional capabilities e.g. you can use it to decrement a local date by days, weeks, months, years etc.\r\n 3. [`LocalDate#minus(TemporalAmount amountToSubtract)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDate.html#minus-java.time.temporal.TemporalAmount-): You can specify a `Period` (or any other type implementing the `TemporalAmount`) to subtract.\r\n\r\nOnce you have yesterday&#39;s date, you can use [`LocalDate#isEqual`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDate.html#isEqual-java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate-) to check if it is equal to the given local date.\r\n\r\n**Demo**:\r\n\r\n    import java.time.LocalDate;\r\n    import java.time.Period;\r\n    import java.time.ZoneId;\r\n    import java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit;\r\n    \r\n    public class Main {\r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            // Note: Replace the default ZoneId with the required ZoneId e.g. ZoneId.of(&quot;Europe/London&quot;)\r\n            LocalDate today = LocalDate.now(ZoneId.systemDefault());\r\n            System.out.println(today);\r\n    \r\n            // Decrementing by one day\r\n            LocalDate yesterday = today.minusDays(1);\r\n            System.out.println(yesterday);\r\n    \r\n            // Alternatively\r\n            yesterday = today.minus(1, ChronoUnit.DAYS);\r\n            System.out.println(yesterday);\r\n    \r\n            // or\r\n            yesterday = today.minus(Period.ofDays(1));\r\n            System.out.println(yesterday);\r\n    \r\n            // A sample LocalDate\r\n            LocalDate givenDate = LocalDate.of(2022, 10, 20);\r\n\r\n            // Check for equality\r\n            System.out.println(givenDate.isEqual(yesterday));\r\n            givenDate = yesterday;\r\n            System.out.println(givenDate.isEqual(yesterday)); // true\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Output**:\r\n\r\n    2022-11-13\r\n    2022-11-12\r\n    2022-11-12\r\n    2022-11-12\r\n    false\r\n    true\r\n\r\nHow to switch from the legacy to the modern date-time API?\r\n--\r\n\r\nYou can switch from the legacy to the modern date-time API using [`Date#toInstant`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Date.html#toInstant--) on a java-util-date instance. Once you have an `Instant`, you can easily obtain other date-time types of `java.time` API.

General Idea is to write all the patterns that you wish to support into external properties file and read them from there and try to parse your String by those formats one by one until you succeed or run out of formats. Note that the order also would be important as some Strings may be valid for several formats (US/European differences). Advantage is that you can keep adding/removing formats to the file without changing your code. So such project could also be customized for different customers\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/java-8-javatime-package-parsing-any-string-date-michael-gantman/","title":"How to convert String to Date without knowing the format?","body":"<p>I once had a task to write a code that would parse a String to date where date format was not known in advance.

I have heard some rumours that it is possible to achieve a 60x optimisation for `n = 11` to this problem. I can only think of the problem as splitting the multiplication into 4 smaller matrices based on the recursive algorithm provided in `Matrix`, hence I just copied the algorithm and translated them into constructors of `MatrixMultiplication` as seen in the `compute` method. However, I have only managed to achieve a 20x optimisation for the `n = 11` . I do not know if my failure to achieve the required optimisation has to do with the algorithm I&#39;m using or the placement of fork and join. I don&#39;t seek an improvement when I changed some of the called constructors into `compute` instead of `fork` and `join`.

I have heard some rumours that it is possible to achieve a 60x optimisation for <code>n = 11</code> to this problem. I can only think of the problem as splitting the multiplication into 4 smaller matrices based on the recursive algorithm provided in <code>Matrix</code>, hence I just copied the algorithm and translated them into constructors of <code>MatrixMultiplication</code> as seen in the <code>compute</code> method. However, I have only managed to achieve a 20x optimisation for the <code>n = 11</code> . I do not know if my failure to achieve the required optimisation has to do with the algorithm I'm using or the placement of fork and join. I don't seek an improvement when I changed some of the called constructors into <code>compute</code> instead of <code>fork</code> and <code>join</code>. Can someone give me a hint about how I can even achieve a 60 time improvement optimisation.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the problem description, my attempt and what I meant by a 20x increase(as per output from the program).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YFj1F.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YFj1F.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tNRB0.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tNRB0.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a> </p>\n\n<p><strong>MatrixMultiplication</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveTask;\n\nclass MatrixMultiplication extends RecursiveTask&lt;Matrix&gt;
