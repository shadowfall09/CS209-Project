noreferrer\">JsonTemplateLayout</a> and have set up a JSON template that adds stack trace information to a <code>stack</code> field.</p>\n<p>However, when logging exceptions, in addition to the stringified stack trace being placed in the stack field, it is also being appended to some of the other custom fields I have specified in the template.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure which bit of configuration (or lack of configuration) is causing this.</p>\n<p>I have not been able to locate a setting in the template that can avoid this.</p>\n<p>Here is the template I have:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n

If you look closely, you'll see some fields such as <code>service</code> and <code>component</code> being set with their specified environment variable values, but they also have the stringified stack

But if you&#39;re not planning to use the interrupts facility in your program, then these exceptions will never be thrown, so you have to ask yourself whether doing the extra work in order to take care of these exceptions, in case you decide to add the interruptibility feature to your program some time later, makes sense. This is one of those things that Java designers insisted that every thread should do — that you could `interrupt()` it, and it will quickly and cleanly abort what it&#39;s doing. I think that&#39;s unnecessary in many cases, but people will look at your code, see this and still say &quot;eew, bad practice!&quot;\r\n\r\n[The official Java tutorial explains interrupts][2]. Basically, if you have one thread `t` doing some processing, and then the user wants to cancel it, from another thread you would call `t.interrupt()`. In the code that&#39;s running on thread `t`, whenever it `sleep()`s, or `wait()`s, etc., an `InterruptedException` will be thrown. If it doesn&#39;t do any of these, then it can (should) also find out if it had been interrupted using `Thread.interrupted()` from time to time. In all these ways of finding out about interrupts, it should abandon what it&#39;s doing and clean up ASAP. (That is to say: if it does so, then this behaviour might be useful to you or someone — that&#39;s the idea of interrupts.)\r\n\r\nSo, Java makes this a checked exception of the `sleep(..)` method, to force you to think about using this facility. The other part of the rationale is that *if* `sleep(..)` is interrupted, then it will wake up early, and that&#39;s an exceptional event. (But remember, there&#39;s that **&quot;if&quot;**.)\r\n\r\nThe important thing is that interrupts don&#39;t just happen for no reason. They happen if you write code to make them happen, or if someone else does, who launches your threads and has a need to cancel their activities. So this is who causes `Thread.sleep(..)` to throw an `InterruptedException`. You do. And if you don&#39;t, then you still need to catch it.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**Edit.** By the way, it would be a better practice to do it this way:\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n        Thread.sleep(1000);\r\n    } catch (InterruptedException ie) {\r\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(&quot;Interrupts not supported.&quot;, ie);\r\n    }\r\nSo, if you, or somebody else, ever tries to interrupt this thread by mistake later, then when they go to test it, they will be reminded that this feature is not implemented. ([`UnsupportedOperationException`][3] is a subclass of `RuntimeException`, so it&#39;s unchecked.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/duke-424174.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/interrupt.html\r\n  [3]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/UnsupportedOperationException.html","title":"Java Thread Sleep and Interrupted Exception","body":"<p>Sleep and interrupts are not related semantically.

I waited for over 10 minutes and I saw that the program was still running. So I modified the code and added connection timeout for 5 sec and read timeout for 30 seconds.

Any updates you make to this entity inside the scope of a database transaction would automatically persist back to the database. The issue is you then pass the non attached User object from the initial request which does not have the ID, so the system thinks you are trying to create a new user, but it fails since there is now a duplicate login. I think to make this work you just need to remove the <code>userService.createUser(user)</code> call and annotate the <code>updateUser</code> controller method with <code>@Transactional</code>. You should make the method public as well.</p>\n<p>Having said that, ALex's suggestion of making an upsert service method is a good idea and then you can move the <code>@Transactional</code> annotation to that method and keep the transaction boundary in your service and out of the controller.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":26496663,"reputation":33,"user_id":20134306,"display_name":"Rosh343"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":74303047,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1667491643,"creation_date":1666808248,"question_id":74212479,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to update a user and add a password to a new column that was created in the database as that password will be encrypted.

Pay attention to the fact that the error says about the file <code>putty.exe</code> but you are showing the code for the file <code>BUG PnUMBER CHAR.png</code>. It may turn out that you are trying to solve the problem in the wrong place.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":19982432,"reputation":13,"user_id":14645242,"display_name":"Pathfinder"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":204,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1667491550,"creation_date":1667403468,"question_id":74291849,"body_markdown":"I am running my scenarios on Jenkins with EC2.

You can do that in the project's Properties, Java Build Path section; or just right-click on the folder and select Build Path &gt; Use as Source Folder\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/taMGJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/taMGJ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that with option 2, when you change your entities you'll have to re-run the maven build (at least generate-sources phase) to see the updated generated classes.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":14191174,"reputation":726,"user_id":10358406,"display_name":"jeffcodes"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1667485475,"creation_date":1667485475,"answer_id":74304692,"question_id":74277293,"body_markdown":"Use the Community Edition of IntelliJ as offered by @joopeggen.\r\nProposed answer by @e-riz is a likely secondary answer.

Why? What am I missing?\r\n```\r\n    import path.to.class.Foo;\r\n    import path.to.class.Foo_; // cannot be resolved error\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n   Foo_.barID; // cannot resolve to a variable\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe underscore_ notation just causes the above errors... ugh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Long version:**\r\n\r\nI work on an API, and my team is newer to the project. None of us JAVA specific devs, and we&#39;ve learned a ton over the last several months. The original devs created the project using IntelliJ, and supported it using that IDE. Unfortunately, our IntelliJ licenses keep being allowed to expire and it takes a week to get it back, and I&#39;m not good with down time, so I tried Eclipse and VSCode. When trying to debug, the project won&#39;t build because some imports are unable to be resolved, as well as some variables that appear to be using JPA 2.0 notation for Dynamic, typesafe queries. \r\nReading the following, this notation appears to have been around a long time, and Eclipse a long time Java IDE, so I think I&#39;m clearly missing something.\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/9379536/what-does-an-underscore-concatenated-to-a-class-name-mean\r\nhttps://developer.ibm.com/articles/j-typesafejpa/#N102F2\r\nhttps://developer.ibm.com/articles/j-typesafejpa/\r\n\r\nI have a hard time believing this is only possible in IntelliJ, so it has to be something I&#39;m missing within the IDE&#39;s. A package, or setting, or something that is not allowing the IDE to utilize the Criteria API? \r\n\r\npom.xml file as requested:\r\n```\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

work for my needs and I do not have to switch IDE&#39;s. I think the proposed answer will work for some, if not most; however, since I was unable (and unwilling to continue) to make the build work with another IDE I am leaving it unselected as the solution. ","title":"Dynamic, Typesafe query syntax invalid in VSCode and Eclipse (works in IntelliJ)","body":"<p>Let me start by saying I'm learning Java, and come from the .NET/C# world.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>\nThis syntax does not work in VSCode or Eclipse IDE, does in IntelliJ. Why? What am I missing?</p>\n<pre><code>    import path.to.class.Foo;\n    import path.to.class.Foo_; // cannot be resolved error\n\n...\n\n   Foo_.barID; // cannot resolve to a variable\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>The underscore_ notation just causes the above errors... ugh</p>\n<p><strong>Long version:</strong></p>\n<p>I work on an API, and my team is newer to the project. None of us JAVA specific devs, and we've learned a ton over the last several months. The original devs created the project using IntelliJ, and supported it using that IDE. Unfortunately, our IntelliJ licenses keep being allowed to expire and it takes a week to get it back, and I'm not good with down time, so I tried Eclipse and VSCode. When trying to debug, the project won't build because some imports are unable to be resolved, as well as some variables that appear to be using JPA 2.0 notation for Dynamic, typesafe queries.\nReading the following, this notation appears to have been around a long time, and Eclipse a long time Java IDE, so I think I'm clearly missing something.\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9379536/what-does-an-underscore-concatenated-to-a-class-name-mean\">What does an underscore concatenated to a class name mean?</a>\n<a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/articles/j-typesafejpa/#N102F2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://developer.ibm.com/articles/j-typesafejpa/#N102F2</a>\n<a href=\"https://developer.ibm.com/articles/j-typesafejpa/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://developer.ibm.com/articles/j-typesafejpa/</a></p>\n<p>I have a hard time believing this is only possible in IntelliJ, so it has to be something I'm missing within the IDE's.

The <code>BinaryOperator</code> that works as the <code>mergeFunction</code> (<code>(a, b) -&gt;a</code>) can be further improved. </p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3500616,"reputation":1957,"user_id":2927457,"display_name":"gustf"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":7,"is_accepted":false,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1461267996,"creation_date":1461267996,"answer_id":36779106,"question_id":36775518,"body_markdown":"Here&#39;s a variant using an `Object[]` as a tuple, not the prettiest code but concise\r\n\r\n    String coolestString = stringList\r\n            .stream()\r\n            .map(s -&gt; new Object[] {s, coolnessIndex(s)})\r\n            .max(Comparator.comparingInt(a -&gt; (int)a[1]))\r\n            .map(a -&gt; (String)a[0])\r\n            .orElse(null);","title":"Java Stream: find an element with a min/max value of an attribute","body":"<p>Here's a variant using an <code>Object[]</code> as a tuple, not the prettiest code but concise</p>\n\n<pre><code>String coolestString = stringList\n        .stream()\n        .map(s -&gt; new Object[] {s, coolnessIndex(s)})\n        .max(Comparator.comparingInt(a -&gt; (int)a[1]))\n        .map(a -&gt; (String)a[0])\n        .orElse(null);\n</code></pre>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1688633,"reputation":1042,"user_id":1551435,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"Jan"},"score":0,"creation_date":1642519657,"post_id":36874571,"comment_id":125089111,"body_markdown":"would it be possible to have only one function `cache` that creates the IdentityHashMap and returns the desired function with the cache as closure?","body":"would it be possible to have only one function <code>cache</code> that creates the IdentityHashMap and returns the desired function with the cache as closure?"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":7766867,"reputation":1369,"user_id":5877791,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Jan Pomik&#225;lek"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":true,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1461700590,"creation_date":1461700590,"answer_id":36874571,"question_id":36775518,"body_markdown":"Thanks everyone for suggestions.
