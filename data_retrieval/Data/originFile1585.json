In the JDK, `BigDecimal` implements `Comparable` but its comparison method is inconsistent with equals.

Since `0.0` and `0.00` have different precisions, they are unequal even though they have the same numeric value. (For an explanation, see\r\n[this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66180493/1441122).)\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example of what it means for a `TreeSet` to violate the general contract of `Set`. (It&#39;s the same situation with `TreeMap` and `Map` but it&#39;s a bit easier to demonstrate using sets.) Let&#39;s compare the results of `contains` to the result of getting the element out of the set and calling `equals`:\r\n\r\n    &gt; TreeSet&lt;BigDecimal&gt; ts = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;()\r\n    &gt; ts.add(z)\r\n    &gt; ts.contains(z)\r\n    true\r\n    &gt; z.equals(ts.iterator().next())\r\n    true\r\n    &gt; ts.contains(zz)\r\n    true\r\n    &gt; zz.equals(ts.iterator().next())\r\n    false\r\n\r\nThe surprising thing here is that the `TreeSet` says it contains the object `zz`, but it&#39;s unequal to the element that&#39;s actually contained in the set. The reason is that `TreeSet` uses its comparison method (`BigDecimal.compareTo`) to determine set membership, not `equals`.\r\n\r\nNow let&#39;s compare `TreeSet` to `HashSet`:\r\n\r\n    &gt; HashSet&lt;BigDecimal&gt; hs = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(ts)\r\n    &gt; hs.equals(ts)\r\n    true\r\n    &gt; ts.contains(zz)\r\n    true\r\n    &gt; hs.contains(zz)\r\n    false\r\n\r\nThis is strange.

Again, this reflects the fact that `TreeSet` is using the comparison method whereas `HashSet` is using `equals`.\r\n\r\nNow let&#39;s add the other object to a `HashSet` and see what happens:\r\n\r\n    &gt; HashSet&lt;BigDecimal&gt; hs2 = new HashSet&lt;&gt;()\r\n    &gt; hs2.add(zz)\r\n    &gt; ts.equals(hs2)\r\n    true\r\n    &gt; hs2.equals(ts)\r\n    false\r\n\r\nNow that&#39;s weird. One set says it&#39;s equal to the other, but the other set says it&#39;s not equal to the first! To understand this, you need to understand how equality of sets is determined. Two sets are considered equal if a) they are of the same size, and b) each element in the other set is also contained in this set. That is, if you have\r\n\r\n    set1.equals(set2)\r\n\r\nthen the equality algorithm looks at the sizes and then it iterates over set2, and for each element it checks whether that element is contained in set1.

However when i run the program clicking one of the checkbox in the tree only fires the mouseClicked() function from the MouseListener about 50% of the time. It usually works after 2 clicks but sometimes works on the first. There doesn't seem to be any consistency.</p>\n<p>I have tried adding a breakpoint at the first line of the mouseclicked() event with <code>TreePath tp = selfPointer.getPathForLocation(arg0.getX(), arg0.getY());</code> and can see that it is not hitting the breakpoint on some clicks so i know the event isn't always firing. A screenshot of the component in my application is below and the code i'm using. I'm very new to Swing and am just trying to get the clicks working.

All of these AttributeConverters simply return the custom value for the Java -&gt; DB mapping, and for the DB -&gt; Java mapping they reconstruct the object with the correct global configuration ```OverridableValue```. It is because I need the reference to the ```OverridableValue``` that I did not implement ```OverriddenValue``` as an ```@Embeddable``` - I would have either have had to persist the ID of the global configuration value, or make it transient, and I decided that was too inconvenient.

So I manually implemented these in the ```OverriddenValue``` class, but they must have been wrong since the changes are still not being detected.\r\n\r\nMomentarily abandoning provider-independence, I tried marking this entity with EclipseLink&#39;s ```@ChangeTracking``` annotation and changing the ```ChangeTrackingType``` to ```DEFERRED```, but this only caused already-detected changes to be delayed and did not enable detection of any new ones. The other tracking types (```ATTRIBUTE``` and ```OBJECT```) require the entity to implement a particular interface ```ChangeTracker``` which seems like it could be helpful, but I don&#39;t quite understand how to make it work.\r\n\r\nI have also tried setting the property &quot;eclipselink.weaving.changetracking&quot; to false in the persistence.xml file, on the off chance that weaving was causing the issue (I don&#39;t really understand weaving).
