/ `companion object` for `static` properties\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Top-level**\r\n\r\nWhen the properties are somewhat related to a class, define them as top-level properties just before the class declaration:\r\n\r\n    const val MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3\r\n    private const val DEFAULT_NAME = &quot;Guest&quot;\r\n    private const val MIN_AGE = 16\r\n    \r\n    data class User(val id: String, val name: String = DEFAULT_NAME)\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the `static` properties in Java. \r\n\r\nWhen the properties are completely independent of any class, you can define them as top-level in a separate file without the class.\r\n\r\n**`companion object`**\r\n\r\nWhen the properties are closely related to a class and will be used only in that class, define them inside a `companion object`:\r\n\r\n    data class User(val id: String, val name: String = DEFAULT_NAME) {\r\n        companion object {\r\n            const val DEFAULT_NAME = &quot;Guest&quot;\r\n            const val MIN_AGE = 16\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nTop-level / `companion object` for `static` methods\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Top-level**\r\n\r\nSimilar to the properties above, when the functions are somewhat related to a class, define them just above the class:\r\n\r\n    fun getAllUsers() { }\r\n    \r\n    fun getProfileFor(userId: String) { }\r\n    \r\n    data class User(val id: String, val name: String)\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n    val userList = getAllUsers()\r\n\r\n**`companion object`**\r\n\r\nWhen the functions are closely related to a class, define them inside a `companion object`:\r\n\r\n    data class User(val id: String, val name: String) {\r\n\r\n        companion object {\r\n\r\n            fun getAll() { }\r\n\r\n            fun profileFor(userId: String) { }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n    val userProfile = User.profileFor(&quot;34&quot;)\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the `static` methods in Java. \r\n\r\nThe top-level functions are often more idiomatic to Kotlin. A better reason to define functions inside the `companion object` is when you are extending a `companion object` with an `interface`. An example of this is shown in the singleton section.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nNested class for `static` class\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen the classes with related functionalities belong together, they can be grouped together by nesting:\r\n\r\n    class User(val id: String, val name: String) {\r\n        class UserAccess : UserDao {\r\n            override fun add(user: User) { }\r\n            override fun remove(id: String) { }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is equivalent to the `static` nested classes in Java. The `UserAccess` class here implements an `interface` `UserDao`.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n    fun main() {\r\n        val john = User(&quot;34&quot;, &quot;John&quot;)\r\n        val userAccess = User.UserAccess()\r\n        userAccess.add(john)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nSingleton `object` for `static INSTANCE`\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Top-level**\r\n\r\nWhen you just want a single object of a class, you no longer need to create a `static INSTANCE` inside a class like in Java. Simply use a top-level `object` declaration:\r\n\r\n    object UserAccess : UserDao {\r\n        override fun add(user: User) { }\r\n        override fun remove(id: String) { }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNotice also how easy it is to extend an `interface` or a `class` in a singleton. \r\n\r\nThe code above, under the hood, produces the following `static INSTANCE` singleton pattern in Java (simplified):\r\n\r\n    public final class UserAccess implements UserDao {\r\n       public static final UserAccess INSTANCE;\r\n    \r\n       public void add(User user) { }\r\n    \r\n       public void remove(String id) { }\r\n    \r\n       private UserAccess() { }\r\n    \r\n       static { INSTANCE = new UserAccess();}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**`companion object`**\r\n\r\nWhen the singleton is closely related to a class use `companion object`:\r\n\r\n    data class User(val id: String, val name: String) {\r\n        companion object : UserDao {\r\n            override fun add(user: User) { }\r\n            override fun remove(id: String) { }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis way you get more elegant naming: `User.add(john)`. Also, you make the intent clear that this singleton is only used as a utility for the `User` class. You can also use the `object` without the `companion` keyword inside the class, if you want multiple singletons or groups of functions/properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n`companion object` for `static` factory\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFactory functions in Koltin are created using the `companion object`. Factory functions are useful when you want to provide multiple ways to create an object where the object construction process is complex or when multiple constructors are not expressive enough.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `newInstance()` factory function in the following snippet creates a user by generating the `id` automatically:\r\n\r\n    class User private constructor(val id: Long, val name: String) {\r\n        companion object {\r\n            private var currentId = 0L;\r\n            fun newInstance(name: String) = User(currentId++, name)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is equivalent to the `static` factory methods in Java. \r\n\r\nThe `constructor` is kept `private` but the `companion object` has access to the `constructor`.\r\n\r\nIn the code above, consistency of the next `id` generation is guaranteed because a `companion object` is a singleton, only one object will keep track of the `id`, there won&#39;t be any duplicate ids.\r\n\r\nAlso notice that companion objects can have properties (`currentId` in this case) to represent state.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n    val john = User.newInstance(&quot;John&quot;)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n`@JvmStatic` for Java interoperability\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe static concept of Java doesn&#39;t exist in Kotlin. A `companion object` is an instance of a real `class` called `Companion`. So, when you call the Kotlin code from Java, an object of the `Companion` class is first instantiated behind the scenes. You need to call the function using the `Companion` object in Java:\r\n\r\n    Profile userProfile = User.Companion.profileFor(&quot;34&quot;);\r\n\r\nFor the idiomatic Java naming and less verbosity, use `@JvmStatic` annotation on that function or property:\r\n\r\n    companion object {\r\n        @JvmStatic\r\n        fun profileFor(userId: String): Profile { }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe `@JvmStatic` annotation creates a separate pure `static` copy of the `getProfileFor()` function. Now you can use it from Java with regular syntax:\r\n\r\n    Profile userProfile = User.profileFor(&quot;34&quot;);\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s it!

It is possible to run Processing code in IntelliJ but you have to import the core library from the Processing app and it is not as easy to do.</p>\n<pre><code>Ball b;\n\nclass Ball{\n  float x, y, diam;\n  \n  //Constructor\n  Ball(float xPos, float yPos, float diameter){\n    x = xPos;\n    y = yPos;\n    diam = diameter;\n  }\n  \n  void display(){\n    fill(0, 255, 0);\n    circle(x,y,diam);\n  }\n}\n\nvoid setup(){\n  size(300, 300);\n  b = new Ball(100,100,40);\n}\n\nvoid draw(){\n   b.display();\n}\n\n\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":20649761,"reputation":1,"user_id":22621558,"display_name":"ilovebender"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":78,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1695535064,"creation_date":1695492199,"question_id":77164333,"body_markdown":"I am trying to make a program which creates a ball that is affected by gravity, and I wanted to use Java Processing to show it.

Does this mean my IP address hasn't been whitelisted successfully?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","unit-testing","junit","mockito","httpclient"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2340745,"reputation":7243,"user_id":2052097,"accept_rate":85,"display_name":"z atef"},"score":0,"creation_date":1630964816,"post_id":69080462,"comment_id":122092086,"body_markdown":"Take a look at this https://gist.github.com/northernbird/0576c43968454f71622bfd3674a623cf","body":"Take a look at this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/northernbird/0576c43968454f71622bfd3674a623cf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">gist.github.com/northernbird/0576c43968454f71622bfd3674a623c&zwnj;&#8203;f</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":11276987,"reputation":17,"user_id":8270770,"display_name":"CodeLearn"},"score":0,"creation_date":1630964988,"post_id":69080462,"comment_id":122092111,"body_markdown":"The code doesnt show how to mock the above mentioned code.

At the time of writing the Java 8 JDK comes with a ZIP file called *src.zip*.  Sometimes, for unexplained reasons, Oracle don&#39;t always include the source.  So for some older versions (and who knows about the future) you have to get hold of the Java source in another way.  It&#39;s worth also being aware that, in the past, Oracle have sometimes included the source with the Linux version of the JDK, but not with the Windows one.\r\n\r\nI just unzipped this file... the top directories are &quot;com&quot;, &quot;java&quot;, &quot;javax&quot;, &quot;launcher&quot; and &quot;org&quot;.  Directory launcher doesn&#39;t contain any files to document.\r\n\r\nYou can generate the javadocs very very simply from any or all of these by [cd][1]&#39;ing at the command prompt/terminal to the directory ...\\src.

In that your request is weird: It&#39;s really hard to come up with plausible use cases _where this line of thought leads to the best answer_. It&#39;s rather easy to come up with scenarios where this is one solution, and not a very good one - other solutions would be better. Hence, likely, you&#39;re in the second situation and you should take a step back and explain the underlying problem.\r\n\r\nIn the unlikely case you really want to go down this road:\r\n\r\nThere are 3 different ways to tackle this.\r\n\r\n## With reflective access to constructors\r\n\r\nYou must create constructors in the sub classes (note that in your examples you&#39;ve named the superclass `Child` and the subclasses `Parent`. This is precisely the wrong way around! To avoid confusion I shall use the term &#39;superclass&#39; and &#39;subclass&#39;, but, really, ordinarily, it&#39;d be `class Parent {}` and `class Child1 extends Parent {}` and `class Child2 extends Parent {}` in common parlance).\r\n\r\nThese constructors would have to take in an instance of the supertype, and it would copy over all relevant fields, and set the rest to the desired default value:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Super {\r\n    String testVar1;\r\n\r\n    public Super(String testVar1) {\r\n      this.testVar1 = testVar1;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class SubA extends Super {\r\n    String testVar2;\r\n\r\n    public SubA(Super s) {\r\n      super(s.getTestVar1());\r\n      this.testVar2 = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class SubB extends Super {\r\n    boolean testVar3;\r\n\r\n    public SubB(Super s) {\r\n      super(s.getTestVar1());\r\n      this.testVar3 = false;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a slight variation on the theme, alternatively your `Super` class can have a constructor that takes an instance of `Super` and copies everything it can. Especially useful if `Super` has lots of properties.\r\n\r\nThe problem with constructors is: They exist entirely outside of the hierarchical type system. It is __not__ possible to define an interface, or in any other way imply that a given class has a certain constructor. Hence, you&#39;re forced to use reflection, and if someone writes an error (does not follow the contract), you won&#39;t know until runtime. In other words, this system would require that all subtypes have a constructor like that, but if you write a subtype that doesn&#39;t, you don&#39;t get any compile-time warnings or errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstatic &lt;T&gt; T create(Class&lt;T&gt; type, Super base) {\r\n  return type.getConstructor(Super.class).newInstance(base);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Factories\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s a reason java has lots of factories: They are the way to fix that problem where static methods and constructors aren&#39;t part of the hierarchical type system. A factory solves this problem by adding a layer: A factory is an instance of an object, and one of its methods makes instances of the thing it is a factory of. This way, the &#39;make a thing&#39; method is an instance method which __do__ participate in the typing system, thus, you can make an interface for it:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface FooFactory&lt;F extends Super&gt; {\r\n  F create(Super base);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Super, SubA and SubB are essentially just as above.\r\n\r\npublic class SubAFactory implements FooFactory&lt;SubA&gt; {\r\n  public static final SubAFactory INSTANCE = new SubAFactory();\r\n\r\n  @Override public SubA create(Super base) {\r\n    return new SubA(base);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s a little bit of extra code, but there is now no longer any need to mess with reflection, and any violation of the setup (such as failing to have that constructor) now _does_ result in compile time errors, which is good. If your case is truly this simple, the code can also be extremely simple:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class SubA extends Super {\r\n  // all the stuff as above.

In that your request is weird: It's really hard to come up with plausible use cases <em>where this line of thought leads to the best answer</em>. It's rather easy to come up with scenarios where this is one solution, and not a very good one - other solutions would be better. Hence, likely, you're in the second situation and you should take a step back and explain the underlying problem.</p>\n<p>In the unlikely case you really want to go down this road:</p>\n<p>There are 3 different ways to tackle this.</p>\n<h2>With reflective access to constructors</h2>\n<p>You must create constructors in the sub classes (note that in your examples you've named the superclass <code>Child</code> and the subclasses <code>Parent</code>. This is precisely the wrong way around! To avoid confusion I shall use the term 'superclass' and 'subclass', but, really, ordinarily, it'd be <code>class Parent {}</code> and <code>class Child1 extends Parent {}</code> and <code>class Child2 extends Parent {}</code> in common parlance).</p>\n<p>These constructors would have to take in an instance of the supertype, and it would copy over all relevant fields, and set the rest to the desired default value:</p>\n<pre><code>public class Super {\n    String testVar1;\n\n    public Super(String testVar1) {\n      this.testVar1 = testVar1;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class SubA extends Super {\n    String testVar2;\n\n    public SubA(Super s) {\n      super(s.getTestVar1());\n      this.testVar2 = &quot;&quot;;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class SubB extends Super {\n    boolean testVar3;\n\n    public SubB(Super s) {\n      super(s.getTestVar1());\n      this.testVar3 = false;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As a slight variation on the theme, alternatively your <code>Super</code> class can have a constructor that takes an instance of <code>Super</code> and copies everything it can. Especially useful if <code>Super</code> has lots of properties.</p>\n<p>The problem with constructors is: They exist entirely outside of the hierarchical type system. It is <strong>not</strong> possible to define an interface, or in any other way imply that a given class has a certain constructor. Hence, you're forced to use reflection, and if someone writes an error (does not follow the contract), you won't know until runtime. In other words, this system would require that all subtypes have a constructor like that, but if you write a subtype that doesn't, you don't get any compile-time warnings or errors:</p>\n<pre><code>static &lt;T&gt; T create(Class&lt;T&gt; type, Super base) {\n  return type.getConstructor(Super.class).newInstance(base);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Factories</h2>\n<p>There's a reason java has lots of factories: They are the way to fix that problem where static methods and constructors aren't part of the hierarchical type system. A factory solves this problem by adding a layer: A factory is an instance of an object, and one of its methods makes instances of the thing it is a factory of. This way, the 'make a thing' method is an instance method which <strong>do</strong> participate in the typing system, thus, you can make an interface for it:</p>\n<pre><code>public interface FooFactory&lt;F extends Super&gt; {\n  F create(Super base);\n}\n\n// Super, SubA and SubB are essentially just as above.\n\npublic class SubAFactory implements FooFactory&lt;SubA&gt; {\n  public static final SubAFactory INSTANCE = new SubAFactory();\n\n  @Override public SubA create(Super base) {\n    return new SubA(base);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It's a little bit of extra code, but there is now no longer any need to mess with reflection, and any violation of the setup (such as failing to have that constructor) now <em>does</em> result in compile time errors, which is good. If your case is truly this simple, the code can also be extremely simple:</p>\n<pre><code>public class SubA extends Super {\n  // all the stuff as above. And also...\n\n  public static final FooFactory&lt;SubA&gt; FACTORY = SubA::new;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>That one line is then all you need.</p>\n<h2>Lombok</h2>\n<p>I noticed you tagged this question with lombok. This feels a bit like boilerplate, so you might be thinking: Huh, I wonder if lombok can generate these factories or reflective 'constructors' perhaps.</p>\n<p>No. It's not <em>common</em>  boilerplate. This isn't a common solution to any problem I'm aware of. Only <em>common boilerplate</em> is a candidate to get attention from Project Lombok.</p>\n<p>SOURCE: I'm 50% of the body that decides what lombok does.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":16221044,"reputation":331,"user_id":11712575,"display_name":"Jason Chan"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":77165439,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1695518343,"creation_date":1695517005,"question_id":77165414,"body_markdown":"I have 2 parent classes, and a child class, and I am trying to make this flow work (Please note, I know there are other workarounds and whatnot, but I am not trying to initialize the variable in a constructor and stuff, this is just a proof of concept):\r\n\r\n    public class Child{\r\n        String testVar1;\r\n    }\r\n \r\n    public class ParentA extends Child{\r\n        String testVar2;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class ParentA extends Child{\r\n        Boolean testVar3;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nI also have a method that was like this:\r\n\r\n    public Child createChild(){\r\n        return new Child(&quot;testString&quot;)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // the method being called ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼\r\n    public ParentA createParentA(){\r\n        return (ParentA) createChild();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public ParentB createParentB(){\r\n        return (ParentB) createChild();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis, of course fails, since you cannot instantiate a parent class with typecasting a child class.

It ends up being a matter of cleanliness of code and personal style.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":6079744,"reputation":425,"user_id":4745890,"display_name":"Utpal Kumar"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1609602004,"creation_date":1609602004,"answer_id":65540919,"question_id":5057931,"body_markdown":"I am little late to answer this.

JPA, by its nature, makes this kind of error easy.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not advocating for JDBC, I'm simply advocating against JPA. Developers who don't or can't work in SQL probably shouldn't be writing relational applications - any more than Developers like me, who couldn't do matrix algebra to save my life, should be writing 3D games. Developers who do use SQL for a living should be horrified by the contorted SQL that hibernate, for one, sends to the server, in order to avoid round trips that shouldn't be necessary in the first place.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3804018,"reputation":1206,"user_id":3156898,"accept_rate":70,"display_name":"thonnor"},"score":0,"creation_date":1573125793,"post_id":57766861,"comment_id":103783862,"body_markdown":"I think I agree with this answer.

value=&quot;50&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\nThis is how you can insert those `post` table records:\r\n\r\n    for (long i = 1; i &lt;= postCount; i++) {\r\n        entityManager.persist(\r\n            new Post()\r\n                .setId(i)\r\n                .setTitle(\r\n                    String.format(\r\n                        &quot;High-Performance Java Persistence, review no. %1$d&quot;, \r\n                        i\r\n                    )\r\n                )\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMuch simpler, right?\r\n\r\nFetching data with JDBC\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nWith JDBC, this is how you execute an SQL projection:\r\n\r\n    int maxResults = 10;\r\n    \r\n    List&lt;Post&gt; posts = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    \r\n    try (PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n            SELECT \r\n                p.id AS id, \r\n                p.title AS title\r\n            FROM post p \r\n            ORDER BY p.id\r\n            LIMIT ?\r\n            &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    )) {\r\n        preparedStatement.setInt(1, maxResults);\r\n    \r\n        try (ResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery()) {\r\n            while (resultSet.next()) {\r\n                int index = 0;\r\n    \t\t\t\r\n                posts.add(\r\n                    new Post()\r\n                        .setId(resultSet.getLong(++index))\r\n                        .setTitle(resultSet.getString(++index))\r\n                );\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\r\n        fail(e.getMessage());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s rather verbose because you have to transform the `ResultSet` to the data structure your application is using (e.g., DTOs, JSON web response).\r\n\r\nFetching data with JPA\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nWith JPA, you can fetch the `List` of `Post` records like this:\r\n\r\n    int maxResults = 10;\r\n    \r\n    List&lt;Post&gt; posts = entityManager.createQuery(&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n        select p\r\n        from post p \r\n        order by p.id\r\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;, Post.class)\r\n    .setMaxResults(maxResults)\r\n    .getResultList();\r\n\r\nAnd, not only that it&#39;s simpler to write it, but it works on every database supported by Hibernate since the pagination syntax is adapted based on the underlying database dialect.\r\n\r\nOther advantages JPA has over JDBC\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\n- You can fetch entities or DTOs. You can even fetch [hierarchical parent-child DTO projection](https://vladmihalcea.com/one-to-many-dto-projection-hibernate/).\r\n- You can enable JDBC batching without changing the data access code.\r\n- You have support for optimistic locking.\r\n- You have a pessimistic locking abstraction that&#39;s independent of the underlying database-specific syntax so that you can acquire a READ and WRITE LOCK or even a [SKIP LOCK](https://vladmihalcea.com/database-job-queue-skip-locked/).\r\n- You have a database-independent pagination API.\r\n- [`hibernate.query.in_clause_parameter_padding`](https://vladmihalcea.com/improve-statement-caching-efficiency-in-clause-parameter-padding/).\r\n- You can use a strongly consistent caching solution that allows you to offload the Primary node, which, for read-write transactions, can only be called vertically.\r\n- You have built-in support for audit logging via Hibernate Envers.\r\n- You have built-in support for [multitenancy](https://vladmihalcea.com/database-multitenancy/). \r\n- You can generate an initial schema script from the entity mappings using the Hibernate [hbm2ddl](https://vladmihalcea.com/hibernate-hbm2ddl-auto-schema/) tool, which you can supply to an automatic schema migration tool, like [Flyway](https://vladmihalcea.com/flyway-database-schema-migrations/).\r\n- Not only that you have the freedom of executing any [native SQL query](https://vladmihalcea.com/the-jpa-entitymanager-createnativequery-is-a-magic-wand/), but you can use the [SqlResultSetMapping](https://vladmihalcea.com/jpa-sqlresultsetmapping/) to transform the JDBC `ResultSet` to JPA entities or DTOs.\r\n\r\nJPA disadvantages\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages of using JPA and Hibernate are the following:\r\n\r\n- While getting started with JPA is very easy, become an expert requires a significant time investment because, besides reading its manual, you still have to learn how database systems work, the SQL standard as well as the specific SQL flavor used by your project relation database.\r\n- There are some less-intuitive behaviors that might surprise beginners, like the [flush operation order](https://vladmihalcea.com/hibernate-facts-knowing-flush-operations-order-matters/).\r\n- The Criteria API is rather verbose, so you need to use a tool like [Codota](https://vladmihalcea.com/codota-jpa-criteria-api/) to write dynamic queries more easily.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n----------\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest things about the Java ecosystem is the abundance of high-quality frameworks. If JPA and Hibernate are not a good fit for your use case, you can use any of the following frameworks:\r\n\r\n- [MyBatis](https://mybatis.org/mybatis-3/), which is a very lightweight SQL query mapper framework.\r\n- [QueryDSL](http://www.querydsl.com/), which allows you to build SQL, JPA, Lucene, and MongoDB queries dynamically.\r\n- [jOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/), which provides a Java metamodel for the underlying tables, stored procedures, and functions and allows you to build an SQL query dynamically using a very intuitive DSL and in a type-safe manner.\r\n\r\nWhile JPA brings many advantages, you have many other high-quality alternatives to use if JPA and Hibernate don&#39;t work best for your current application requirements. So, nowadays, you don&#39;t really need to use plain JDBC unless you are developing a data access framework.\r\n\r\n","title":"Why use JPA instead of writing the SQL query using JDBC?","body":"<h2>JDBC is verbose</h2>\n<p>For instance, this is the most common way of inserting some records:</p>\n<pre><code>int postCount = 100;\n\ntry (PreparedStatement postStatement = connection.prepareStatement(&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    INSERT INTO post (\n        id,\n        title \n    ) \n    VALUES (\n        ?, \n        ?\n    )\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\n)) {\n    for (int i = 1;

I am developing a text novel by analogy with lifeLine. The bottom line is that the text of the story is displayed on the screen with a slight delay. I want the gameplay to be like a chat in a messenger. When the text from the array is fully displayed on the screen, from 2 to 5 buttons with the choice of action should be displayed. \r\n\r\nNow I will describe the problem. To display the text, I use the ListView component. If I add a delay of 1 second to the loop, then the text will not be displayed sequentially, but will be displayed completely. And I would like the text to be displayed sequentially with a delay of 1 second. I tried using a handler and it helped.

I am developing a text novel by analogy with lifeLine. The bottom line is that the text of the story is displayed on the screen with a slight delay. I want the gameplay to be like a chat in a messenger. When the text from the array is fully displayed on the screen, from 2 to 5 buttons with the choice of action should be displayed.</p>\n<p>Now I will describe the problem. To display the text, I use the ListView component. If I add a delay of 1 second to the loop, then the text will not be displayed sequentially, but will be displayed completely. And I would like the text to be displayed sequentially with a delay of 1 second. I tried using a handler and it helped.

I personally use the sequence based approach most of the time and only use the UUID approach if I need to expose an identifier to external systems.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":5122641,"reputation":51,"user_id":4105739,"display_name":"Marcos Oliveira"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1656682350,"creation_date":1656680559,"answer_id":72829686,"question_id":5031614,"body_markdown":"I using a class EntityBase and inherited to all my entities of JPA and this it works very good to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @author marcos.oliveira\r\n     */\r\n    @MappedSuperclass\r\n    public abstract class EntityBase&lt;TId extends Serializable&gt; implements Serializable{\r\n        /**\r\n         *\r\n         */\r\n        private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\r\n    \r\n        @Id\r\n        @Column(name = &quot;id&quot;, unique = true, nullable = false)\r\n        @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\r\n        protected TId id;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        public TId getId() {\r\n            return this.id;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void setId(TId id) {\r\n            this.id = id;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public int hashCode() {\r\n            return (super.hashCode() * 907) + Objects.hashCode(getId());//this.getId().hashCode();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public String toString() {\r\n            return super.toString() + &quot; [Id=&quot; + id + &quot;]&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public boolean equals(Object obj) {\r\n            if (this == obj) {\r\n                return true;\r\n            }\r\n            if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) {\r\n                return false;\r\n            }\r\n            EntityBase entity = (EntityBase) obj;\r\n            if (entity.id == null || id == null) {\r\n                return false;\r\n            }\r\n            return Objects.equals(id, entity.id);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nReference: https://thorben-janssen.com/ultimate-guide-to-implementing-equals-and-hashcode-with-hibernate/","title":"The JPA hashCode() / equals() dilemma","body":"<p>I using a class EntityBase and inherited to all my entities of JPA and this it works very good to me.</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * @author marcos.oliveira\n */\n@MappedSuperclass\npublic abstract class EntityBase&lt;TId extends Serializable&gt; implements Serializable{\n    /**\n     *\n     */\n    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n\n    @Id\n    @Column(name = &quot;id&quot;, unique = true, nullable = false)\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n    protected TId id;\n\n\n\n    public TId getId() {\n        return this.id;\n    }\n\n    public void setId(TId id) {\n        this.id = id;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int hashCode() {\n        return (super.hashCode() * 907) + Objects.hashCode(getId());//this.getId().hashCode();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return super.toString() + &quot; [Id=&quot; + id + &quot;]&quot;;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n        if (this == obj) {\n            return true;\n        }\n        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        EntityBase entity = (EntityBase) obj;\n        if (entity.id == null || id == null) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        return Objects.equals(id, entity.id);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"https://thorben-janssen.com/ultimate-guide-to-implementing-equals-and-hashcode-with-hibernate/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://thorben-janssen.com/ultimate-guide-to-implementing-equals-and-hashcode-with-hibernate/</a></p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":234754,"reputation":5730,"user_id":501113,"accept_rate":90,"display_name":"chaotic3quilibrium"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1695048262,"creation_date":1694541534,"answer_id":77091598,"question_id":5031614,"body_markdown":"In answer to the OPs two questions:\r\n  &gt; Did I miss an option and/or pro/con point?  \r\n\r\nI think you covered all the options/context.\r\n\r\n  &gt; What option did you choose and why?\r\n\r\nI chose OP&#39;s option 2 - Override them, based on the primary key\r\n\r\nBelow is the pattern I&#39;m using at and beyond Java 16 where JPA (i.e. the database) is generating the `marketId` when first saved (INSERTED) into its repository.\r\n\r\n**The key difference:** Keeping `equals` and `hashCode` consistent regarding the two states (`null` and `not null`) of the `marketId`.\r\n\r\nIOW, they are consistent with each other per their stated contracts.
