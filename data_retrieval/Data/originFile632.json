Build a dynamic library:\r\n```\r\nnasm -f elf32 native.asm ; We compile the file on the assembler\r\ngcc -shared -m32 -o libnative.so native.o ; We create a dynamic library &quot;libnative.so&quot;\r\n```\r\n4. run:\r\n```java\r\npublic class Main {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        NativeLibrary lib = new NativeLibrary();\r\n        int sum = lib.add(2, 3); // call method &quot;add&quot;\r\n        System.out.println(sum); // output data in console\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","title":"Native methods in Java","body":"<p>A native method in Java is a method that is written in a language other than Java and can be called from a Java program.</p>\n<p>Such methods can be useful in some situations, for example, if you need to interact with the operating system or with executable files that are not supported by Java.</p>\n<p>In order to call a native method, you must first write it in a non-Java language, such as C/C++.

Example:</p>\n<pre><code>System.loadLibrary(&quot;myLibrary&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>where &quot;myLibrary&quot; is the filename of the library you compiled.</p>\n<p>Finally, you can call your native method just like any other Java method:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>myNativeMethod();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Native methods can be useful in some cases, but use them with caution, as they can cause problems with the security, stability, and portability of the application.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of calling a native method in Java, the library of which is written in assembler:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create class with native method:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class NativeLibrary {\n    static {\n        System.loadLibrary(&quot;native&quot;);\n    }\n\n    public native int add(int a, int b);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Create a dynamic library in assembler (e.g. for Linux):</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>section .data ; Data section\nsection .text ; Code section\n     global _add ; Declare the global symbol &quot;_add&quot;\n\n_add: ; Start of function &quot;_add&quot;\n     push ebp ; We store the stack base register on the stack\n     mov ebp, esp ; We set the stack base register\n     mov eax, [ebp+8] ; a is the first argument of the function, stored on the stack with an 8-byte offset\n     mov ebx, [ebp+12] ; b is the second argument of the function, stored on the stack with a 12-byte offset\n     add eax, ebx ; Add &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;\n     mov esp, ebp ; We restore the stack register\n     pop ebp ; We restore the stack base register\n     ret; We return the result\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Build a dynamic library:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code>nasm -f elf32 native.asm ; We compile the file on the assembler\ngcc -shared -m32 -o libnative.so native.o ; We create a dynamic library &quot;libnative.so&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>run:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        NativeLibrary lib = new NativeLibrary();\n        int sum = lib.add(2, 3); // call method &quot;add&quot;\n        System.out.println(sum); // output data in console\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":437942,"reputation":407,"user_id":825901,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"killerCoder"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":6435,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"accepted_answer_id":6557406,"answer_count":6,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1676978944,"creation_date":1309614045,"question_id":6557358,"body_markdown":"I have spent some time learning what are Java Native methods and that they are implemented in platform dependent code(mostly C).\r\n\r\nBut where can I find those native implementations of Java? eg : sleep(long millis) method of Thread class is native.

That way, the code is much easier for other people to read, I can separate my concerns, and I can focus on one small part of the GUI at a time.</p>\n<p>Here's the complete, runnable code.</p>\n<pre><code>import java.awt.BorderLayout;\nimport java.awt.Color;\nimport java.awt.Dimension;\nimport java.awt.FlowLayout;\n\nimport javax.swing.BorderFactory;\nimport javax.swing.BoxLayout;\nimport javax.swing.JButton;\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\nimport javax.swing.JPanel;\nimport javax.swing.SwingUtilities;\n\npublic class BorderLayoutExample implements Runnable {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new BorderLayoutExample());\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;Border Layout Example&quot;);\n        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n\n        frame.add(createWestPanel(), BorderLayout.WEST);\n        frame.add(createGreenPanel(), BorderLayout.CENTER);\n\n        frame.pack();\n        frame.setLocationByPlatform(true);\n        frame.setVisible(true);\n    }\n\n    private JPanel createGreenPanel() {\n        JPanel panel = new JPanel(new FlowLayout(FlowLayout.LEADING, 5, 5));\n        panel.setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(5, 5, 5, 5));\n        panel.setBackground(Color.green);\n        panel.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(800, 600));\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 99; i++) {\n            panel.add(new JButton(String.format(&quot;%02d&quot;, i)));\n        }\n\n        return panel;\n    }\n\n    private JPanel createWestPanel() {\n        JPanel panel = new JPanel();\n        panel.setLayout(new BoxLayout(panel, BoxLayout.Y_AXIS));\n        panel.add(createColoredPanel(Color.red));\n        panel.add(createColoredPanel(Color.blue));\n\n        return panel;\n    }\n\n    private JPanel createColoredPanel(Color color) {\n        JPanel panel = new JPanel();\n        panel.setBackground(color);\n        panel.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(300, 300));\n\n        return panel;\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":21938522,"reputation":328,"user_id":16219380,"display_name":"Aman"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":178,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":75519793,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1676978466,"creation_date":1676975675,"question_id":75519236,"body_markdown":"Here is the code with problem:\r\n---\r\n```java\r\nimport java.awt.Color;\r\nimport java.awt.Dimension;\r\nimport java.awt.FlowLayout;\r\n\r\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\r\nimport javax.swing.JPanel;\r\nimport javax.swing.JButton;\r\n\r\npublic class xtemp {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        JFrame frame = new JFrame();\r\n        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\r\n        frame.setSize(1067, 600);\r\n        frame.getContentPane().setBackground(new Color(0x000000));\r\n        frame.setLayout(null);\r\n\r\n        JPanel panel_red = new JPanel();\r\n        panel_red.setBackground(Color.red);\r\n        panel_red.setBounds(10, 10, 300, 300);\r\n\r\n        JPanel panel_blue = new JPanel();\r\n        panel_blue.setBackground(Color.blue);\r\n        panel_blue.setBounds(10, 310, 300, 300);\r\n\r\n        JPanel panel_green = new JPanel();\r\n        panel_green.setBackground(Color.green);\r\n        panel_green.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(250, 250));\r\n        panel_green.setBounds(310, 10, 800, 600);\r\n        panel_green.setLayout(new FlowLayout(FlowLayout.TRAILING, 9, 16));\r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 99; i++)\r\n            panel_green.add(new JButton(String.format(&quot;%02d&quot;, i)));\r\n\r\n        frame.add(panel_red);\r\n        frame.add(panel_green);\r\n        frame.add(panel_blue);\r\n        frame.setVisible(true);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd this is the output of the code:\r\n---\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nI want an output similar to this:\r\n---\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nI want to use multiple panels and give different layouts to different panels within a frame.

Subtle aspects of the actual code may change the time of verification (and hence, loading of dependencies)."},{"owner":{"account_id":3211603,"reputation":289317,"user_id":2711488,"display_name":"Holger"},"score":1,"creation_date":1672657592,"post_id":74681064,"comment_id":132320464,"body_markdown":"I suggest to change the sentence to “…the `java.util.logging.Logger` class is loaded as soon as the `PerfMark` class is *verified*” which not only is more correct, it also hints at the verifier as the cause of the loading.","body":"I suggest to change the sentence to “…the <code>java.util.logging.Logger</code> class is loaded as soon as the <code>PerfMark</code> class is <i>verified</i>” which not only is more correct, it also hints at the verifier as the cause of the loading."}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":7423601,"reputation":18712,"user_id":5646962,"display_name":"Thomas Kl&#228;ger"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1672697372,"creation_date":1670189187,"answer_id":74681064,"question_id":74680847,"body_markdown":"I think the important point of that commit is to load the classes from `java.util.logging` only when it is really required (when the system property &quot;io.perfmark.PerfMark.debug&quot; is &quot;true&quot; and `err` is not `null`, i.e. when the class `io.perfmark.impl.SecretPerfMarkImpl$PerfMarkImpl` is not available or that class has not the required constructor.)\r\n\r\nIf the code is\r\n\r\n    Logger.getLogger(PerfMark.class.getName()).log(Level.FINE, &quot;Error during PerfMark.&lt;clinit&gt;&quot;, err);\r\n\r\nthen the `java.util.logging.Logger` class may be loaded as soon as the `PerfMark` class is verified and linked (since linking `PerfMark` requires that the static initializer block is executed).\r\n\r\nWith this convoluted code the `java.util.logging.Logger` is only loaded if `PerfMark` cannot load its support class `io.perfmark.impl.SecretPerfMarkImpl$PerfMarkImpl` **and** the system property &quot;io.perfmark.PerfMark.debug&quot; is set to &quot;true&quot; (which probably means that `java.util.logging.Logger` is almost never loaded just because you use `PerfMark`)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe JVM Specification has clauses that loading / verifying / linking of a class is not required to load all the referenced classes, and modern JVM implementations will probably implement many of these points to reduce unnecessary class loading and improve performance.
