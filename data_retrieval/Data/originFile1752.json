Did I implement the passive view correctly?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","xml","kotlin","retrofit"],"owner":{"account_id":20443317,"reputation":41,"user_id":14999693,"display_name":"faiz dev"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":175,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":0,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1639763061,"creation_date":1639746838,"question_id":70393753,"body_markdown":"I want to show errors messages that come from my API response but every time onError() function is called inside RXJava It shows built-in Errors something Like **time exception**, **network error**, etc. please tell me how can I Show Api Response messages Like **message.type** , **message.text** these are my error messages. thanks\r\n\r\n**here is Api Response**\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;code&quot;: 400,\r\n        &quot;status&quot;: &quot;Bad Request&quot;,\r\n        &quot;message&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;WARNING&quot;,\r\n            &quot;text&quot;: &quot;User was not found&quot;\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;data&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;generatedMessage&quot;: false,\r\n            &quot;code&quot;: &quot;ERR_ASSERTION&quot;,\r\n            &quot;actual&quot;: null,\r\n            &quot;expected&quot;: true,\r\n            &quot;operator&quot;: &quot;==&quot;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Here is api call**\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n     @POST(&quot;api/auth/login&quot;)\r\n        fun login(@Body loginModel: loginModel): Observable&lt;LoginResponseModel&gt;\r\n\r\n**Here is Base URl Code**\r\n\r\n     private val CLIENT_URL = &quot;http://rmms.dummy.org:3001&quot;\r\n    \r\n        private val client = OkHttpClient.Builder().build()\r\n        private val retrofit = Retrofit.Builder()\r\n            .baseUrl(CLIENT_URL)\r\n            .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())\r\n            .addCallAdapterFactory(RxJava2CallAdapterFactory.create())\r\n            .client(client)\r\n            .build()\r\n    \r\n        fun&lt;T&gt;

Even at controller, I have to write separate Rest APIs for all id's.\nIs there a better approach to solve this?\nI am using hibernate and Postgres DB.\nI am adding few POJO classes and UserType classes which I have already implemented.</p>\n<pre><code>public class AlexRob implements Serializable {\n\n    private String emailid;\n    private String city;\n\n    public String getEmailid() {\n        return emailid;\n    }\n\n    public void setEmailid(String emailid) {\n        this.emailid = emailid;\n    }\n\n    public String getCity() {\n        return city;\n    }\n\n    public void setCity(String city) {\n        this.city = city;\n    }\n}\n-------------------\npublic class Janice implements Serializable {\n\n    private String emailid;\n    private String city;\n\n    public String getLink() {\n        return Link;\n    }\n\n    public void setLink(String link) {\n        Link = link;\n    }\n\n    private String Link;\n    public String getEmailid() {\n        return emailid;\n    }\n\n    public void setEmailid(String emailid) {\n        this.emailid = emailid;\n    }\n\n    public String getCity() {\n        return city;\n    }\n\n    public void setCity(String city) {\n        this.city = city;\n    }\n}\n-----------------\n//Custom UserType classes are defined for these by implementing UserType interface from hibernate.\npublic class JaniceType implements UserType {\n    @Override\n    public int[] sqlTypes() {\n        return new int[]{ Types.JAVA_OBJECT };}\n\n    @Override\n    public Class&lt;Janice&gt; returnedClass() {\n        return Janice.class;\n    }\n//more overrided methods\n------------\npublic class AlexRobType implements UserType {\n    @Override\n    public int[] sqlTypes() {\n        return new int[]{ Types.JAVA_OBJECT };}\n\n    @Override\n    public Class&lt;AlexRob&gt; returnedClass() {\n        return AlexRob.class;\n    }\n//Now I have defined entities for each UserType class Like below\n\n@Entity\n@Table(name = &quot;information&quot;,schema = &quot;public&quot;)\n@TypeDef(name = &quot;AlexRobType&quot;,typeClass = AlexRobType.class )\npublic class AlexRobImpl {\n\n    @Id\n    @Column(name = &quot;id&quot;)\n    private String id;\n\n    @Column(name = &quot;data&quot;)\n    @Type(type = &quot;AlexRobType&quot;)\n    private AlexRob alexrob;\n    \n    //getter and setters \n-------------\n@Entity\n@Table(name = &quot;information&quot;,schema = &quot;public&quot;)\n@TypeDef(name = &quot;JaniceType&quot;,typeClass = JaniceType.class )\npublic class JaniceImpl {\n\n    @Id\n    @Column(name = &quot;id&quot;)\n    private String id;\n\n    @Column(name = &quot;data&quot;)\n    @Type(type = &quot;JaniceType&quot;)\n    private Janice janice;\n    \n    //getter and setters \n</code></pre>\n<p>Now I can all them separately from the controller and it works fine but I want to have a single controller where I will define my API's and values will be set according to id.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","while-loop"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":5534873,"reputation":18496,"user_id":4393565,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"P.J.Meisch"},"score":0,"creation_date":1460213800,"post_id":36518411,"comment_id":60642270,"body_markdown":"what error do you get?","body":"what error do you get?"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":5279295,"reputation":813,"user_id":4215196,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Dimitrios Begnis"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1460213968,"creation_date":1460213636,"answer_id":36518441,"question_id":36518411,"body_markdown":"You have written `While` instead of `while`.\r\n\r\n    do {\r\n    ...\r\n    } While (Salary &lt; 0);\r\n\r\ncorrect would be:\r\n\r\n    do {\r\n    ...\r\n    } while (Salary &lt; 0);\r\n\r\nHope this solves your problem.","title":"Getting &quot;while expected&quot; error in &quot;do...while&quot; loop","body":"<p>You have written <code>While</code> instead of <code>while</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>do {\n...\n} While (Salary &lt; 0);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>correct would be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>do {\n...\n} while (Salary &lt; 0);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Hope this solves your problem.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3034610,"reputation":3931,"user_id":2572994,"accept_rate":83,"display_name":"Ivaylo Toskov"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1460213937,"creation_date":1460213937,"answer_id":36518493,"question_id":36518411,"body_markdown":"Your `do-while` loop has an invalid syntax.

You therefore will probably want to have some means of directing your actors to start using a definition of processing which entails sending fewer onward messages; as a consequence this sort of thing must be custom for your application and fit the problem you're trying to solve with the application (and there's no guarantee that such a definition of processing exists).</p>\n<p>For this reason, the more Akka-idiomatic thing is to accept that delivery and processing of a message is generally not guaranteed to ever happen.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":552790,"reputation":1926,"user_id":918030,"accept_rate":40,"display_name":"stikkos"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1639745322,"creation_date":1639745322,"answer_id":70393433,"question_id":69990404,"body_markdown":"You can use coordinated shutdown (https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/coordinated-shutdown.html) for this.\r\n\r\nYou can terminate the system in a `PreDestroy` callback like:\r\n\r\n    CoordinatedShutdown.get(system)\r\n                       .runAll(CoordinatedShutdown.jvmExitReason())\r\n                       .get(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\r\n\r\nAnd then you can register your actor as follows:\r\n\r\n    CoordinatedShutdown.get(system())\r\n                        .addCancellableTask(\r\n                                CoordinatedShutdown.PhaseServiceRequestsDone(),\r\n                                &quot;shutdown-actor&quot;,\r\n                                () -&gt;

But one Library (PDFBox / openhtml2pdf) does use Apache Commons Logging. I want to disable it (or better, narrow it down to Server log level). As written [here][1] and [here][2] I have to put \r\n\r\n    java.util.logging.Logger.getLogger(&quot;org.apache.pdfbox&quot;)\r\n    .setLevel(java.util.logging.Level.OFF);\r\n\r\nsomewhere in the main class (main function or static initializer block). Unfortunately I have no idea, what my main class is (do I necessarily have one?). There is no **MainClass** or **start-class** or something defined in `pom.xml`. So where do I have to put line in a Spring Web Mvc project to have it executed before everything starts?\r\n\r\n**-- Edit:**\r\n\r\nAnother approach I tried is to exclude commons-logging in pom-xml\r\n\r\n    \t&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n        \t&lt;!-- Required for PDF export. --&gt;\r\n        \t&lt;groupId&gt;com.openhtmltopdf&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n        \t&lt;artifactId&gt;openhtmltopdf-pdfbox&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        \t&lt;version&gt;${openhtml-version}&lt;/version&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;exclusions&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;exclusion&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;commons-logging&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;commons-logging&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;/exclusion&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;/exclusions&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\nBut it did not help.\r\n\r\n**-- Edit 2:**\r\n\r\n    \t&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n        \t&lt;!-- Required for PDF export. --&gt;\r\n        \t&lt;groupId&gt;com.openhtmltopdf&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n        \t&lt;artifactId&gt;openhtmltopdf-pdfbox&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        \t&lt;version&gt;${openhtml-version}&lt;/version&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\n\t\t&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.pdfbox&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;pdfbox&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;version&gt;${pdfbox-version}&lt;/version&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;exclusions&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;exclusion&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;commons-logging&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;commons-logging&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;/exclusion&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;/exclusions&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n        &lt;openhtml-version&gt;0.0.1-RC12&lt;/openhtml-version&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;pdfbox-version&gt;2.0.8&lt;/pdfbox-version&gt;\r\n\r\nAs we can see [here][3], my version of opnehtml2pdf ships with pdfbox version 2.0.8.\r\n\r\n**-- Edit 3**\r\n\r\nI Use Spring Web MVC, not Spring Boot.
