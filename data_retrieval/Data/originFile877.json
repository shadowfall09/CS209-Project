Hence the type for member variable `memory` should probably be [List](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html) rather than `ArrayList`.\r\n\r\nNote that `ArrayList` may waste memory if the list of &quot;note&quot;s is large. I suggest using [LinkedList](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/LinkedList.html) instead. Alternatively, use an array (rather than a `List`) and handle expanding the array when adding a &quot;note&quot; as well as reducing the array when removing a &quot;note&quot;.\r\n\r\nHaving an infinite loop, i.e. `while (true)`, which contains a single `if-else` where both the `if` block and the `else` block contain `break` statements, means that the loop will perform exactly one iteration. May as well remove the `while` loop &amp;ndash; which means also removing the `break` statements.\r\n\r\nRather than writing the code that generates a timestamp repeatedly, you should adopt the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principle and extract that code into a separate method.\r\n\r\nThe file name should be a constant so as to minimize the amount of code changes you will need to do if you decide to change the file name.\r\n\r\nBy convention, text files have a filename extension of `.txt` whereas binary files have the `.data` extension.\r\n\r\nAlthough you don&#39;t need to, I personally prefer to initialize class member variables in the constructor.\r\n\r\nThe below code is a [SSCCE](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/22754/sscce-how-to-provide-examples-for-programming-questions), hence I added a `main` method.

Alternatively, use an array (rather than a <code>List</code>) and handle expanding the array when adding a &quot;note&quot; as well as reducing the array when removing a &quot;note&quot;.</p>\n<p>Having an infinite loop, i.e. <code>while (true)</code>, which contains a single <code>if-else</code> where both the <code>if</code> block and the <code>else</code> block contain <code>break</code> statements, means that the loop will perform exactly one iteration. May as well remove the <code>while</code> loop – which means also removing the <code>break</code> statements.</p>\n<p>Rather than writing the code that generates a timestamp repeatedly, you should adopt the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">DRY</a> principle and extract that code into a separate method.</p>\n<p>The file name should be a constant so as to minimize the amount of code changes you will need to do if you decide to change the file name.</p>\n<p>By convention, text files have a filename extension of <code>.txt</code> whereas binary files have the <code>.data</code> extension.</p>\n<p>Although you don't need to, I personally prefer to initialize class member variables in the constructor.</p>\n<p>The below code is a <a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/22754/sscce-how-to-provide-examples-for-programming-questions\">SSCCE</a>, hence I added a <code>main</code> method.

It contains the `SecurityContext`.\r\n&gt; securitycontextholder\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; [![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The `SecurityContextHolder` is where Spring Security stores the\r\n&gt; details of who is authenticated. Spring Security does not care how the\r\n&gt; `SecurityContextHolder` is populated. If it contains a value, then it\r\n&gt; is used as the currently authenticated user.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; ...\r\n\r\nSo, as a recap, the main purpose of `SecurityContextHolder` is to manage `SecurityContext`. And security context is meant to provide access to the user&#39;s [`Authentication`][auth].\r\n\r\n`Authentication` represents the currently authenticated user. And since `Authentication` a Bean, it can be provided through dependency injection in another Bean, for instance as a method parameter.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s have a look at an example. Assume we have a controller which has an endpoint returning an instance of `Foo` which requires some user&#39;s information from the `Authentication`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@RestController\r\npublic class FooController {\r\n    \r\n    @GetMapping(&quot;/foo&quot;)\r\n    Foo getFoo(Authentication a) {\r\n        \r\n        return FooUtils.generateFoo(a);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt makes use of the `generateFoo()` method by passing `Authentication` injected a parameter. Method `generateFoo()` located in the `FooUtils` which is a utility class.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class FooUtils {\r\n    public static Foo generateFoo(Authentication a) {\r\n        \r\n        return new Foo(a.getPrincipal());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Authentication` can&#39;t be injected in the methods of `FooUtils`, since it&#39;s a not a Bean, therefore it&#39;s being handed out by the caller. If we imagine that chain of calls would be longer, i.e. there would be more actions in between the calling endpoint method and `FooUtils.generateFoo()` it would not be very convenient to pass around `Authentication` through several methods where it&#39;s not going to be used.\r\n\r\nInstead, can make use of the `SecurityContextHolder` and obtain `Authentication` right on the spot inside the `FooUtils`:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class FooUtils {\r\n    public static Foo generateFoo() {\r\n        Authentication a = SecurityContextHolder\r\n            .getContext()\r\n            .getAuthentication();\r\n        \r\n        return new Foo(a.getPrincipal());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   [contextHolder]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/core/context/SecurityContextHolder.html\r\n\r\n   [sch]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.3.9.RELEASE/reference/html5/#servlet-authentication-securitycontextholder\r\n\r\n   [context]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/core/context/SecurityContext.html\r\n\r\n   [auth]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/core/Authentication.html\r\n\r\n   [threadLocal]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/ThreadLocal.html\r\n\r\n   [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/uwq93.png","title":"Isn&#39;t SecurityContextHolder a Bean?","body":"<p><a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/core/context/SecurityContextHolder.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>SecurityContextHolder</code></a> is a utility class which declares a bunch of <code>static</code> methods, which can be accessed using class name.</p>\n<p>It doesn't make much sense to instantiate utility classes (their constructors are usually private to emphasize that), and for that reason <code>SecurityContextHolder</code> is not a Bean in the Context, hence there's no way (<em>and no need</em>) to inject it.</p>\n<p>The purpose <code>SecurityContextHolder</code> to facilitate access to the <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/core/context/SecurityContext.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>SecurityContext</code></a>, which contains information specific to the currently authenticated user.
