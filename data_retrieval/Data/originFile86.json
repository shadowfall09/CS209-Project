That is an application that bundles not only your code and its third-party dependencies, but also the Java Run-Time Environment itself.&#160;Your end user won&#39;t need to install Java separately.\r\n\r\n## GraalVM Native Image\r\n\r\nOne option for creating a self-contained application is [GraalVM&#39;s native image][8]. Note that this will also ahead-of-time compile your Java code to native code.\r\n\r\nI have very little experience with GraalVM, so I won&#39;t give an example, but here are some links that may help:\r\n\r\n* [Create native JavaFX applications using GraalVM 22 builds from Gluon][9]\r\n\r\n* [How to create JavaFX native images | BellSoft Java][10]\r\n\r\n\r\n## jpackage\r\n\r\nA relatively accessible tool for creating a self-contained applications and installers is [`jpackage`][3]. It comes with the JDK since version 16. See the [Packaging Tool User Guide][5] for more information. It would also help to understand [`jlink`][6], as `jpackage` will either use `jlink` &quot;behind the scenes&quot; to generate a custom run-time image, or you&#39;ll use `jlink` explicitly and then provide `jpackage` with the custom run-time image.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne significant downside to using `jpackage`, however, is that it can only create application images and installers for the operating system it is running on. If you want a Windows application, then you&#39;ll have to build your project on Windows, with the same being true for Linux and macOS.&#160;And as [jewelsea explains in a comment][4], there are also platform-specific issues you&#39;ll have to resolve:\r\n\r\n&gt; Creating installers for multiple platforms is tricky and each platform has its own quirks you need to work with. For example, Windows requires increasing versions for updates, OS X requires (paid I believe) developer signing certs. So be prepared to spend some time and (probably) a bit of money to create the installers. Though there are existing guides, such as those I referenced, there will probably still be some platform and app-specific quirks you will need to work through on your own with limited outside help.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re going to create a self-contained application, then I would suggest you forgo creating a fat/uber/shadowed JAR file. A self-contained application already contains all dependencies, so a shadowed JAR file is unlikely to provide any benefits. Plus, if you&#39;re going to be using `jpackage` to create the installer, you might as well design your entire deployment around `jpackage` from the start.\r\n\r\nUsing Maven profiles can solve a lot of the platform-specific configuration issues. While any remaining platform-specific configuration, as well as building the application on multiple platforms and publishing it automatically, can likely be accomplished with some kind of CI/CD pipeline. Though remember to **never** commit any secrets to your VCS (e.g., Git), which by extension means do not put any secrets in the POM file(s).\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nHere is a POM that is configured to create an `msi` installer file when the `windows` profile is activated. Note there is only configurations for Windows in this example. The [org.panteleyev:jpackage-maven-plugin][7] plugin is used to execute `jpackage`.\r\n\r\nThis POM is designed for a **non-modular** application. As such, it&#39;s configured so that the JavaFX modules are added to the custom run-time image, while the project code and any other dependencies are configured to be placed on the class-path via `--input` and `--main-jar`. By having JavaFX in the custom run-time image, it will implicitly be on the module-path.\r\n\r\n_**Disclaimer:** I&#39;m more familiar with Gradle than Maven, so there may be ways to simplify the following POM._\r\n\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;project xmlns=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0&quot;\r\n  xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\r\n  xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;groupId&gt;com.example&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;app&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n  &lt;version&gt;1.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;name&gt;app&lt;/name&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;properties&gt;\r\n    &lt;project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;UTF-8&lt;/project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;\r\n    &lt;maven.compiler.source&gt;21&lt;/maven.compiler.source&gt;\r\n    &lt;maven.compiler.target&gt;21&lt;/maven.compiler.target&gt;\r\n    &lt;javafxVersion&gt;21.0.1&lt;/javafxVersion&gt;\r\n    &lt;libsDir&gt;${project.build.directory}/artifacts/libs&lt;/libsDir&gt;\r\n    &lt;javafxModsDir&gt;${project.build.directory}/artifacts/javafx&lt;/javafxModsDir&gt;\r\n  &lt;/properties&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;dependencies&gt;\r\n    &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n      &lt;groupId&gt;org.openjfx&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n      &lt;artifactId&gt;javafx-controls&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n      &lt;version&gt;${javafxVersion}&lt;/version&gt;\r\n    &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n  &lt;/dependencies&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;build&gt;\r\n    &lt;pluginManagement&gt;\r\n      &lt;!-- Lock in versions. --&gt;\r\n      &lt;plugins&gt;\r\n        &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n          &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-clean-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n          &lt;version&gt;3.3.2&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n        &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n          &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-resources-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n          &lt;version&gt;3.3.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n        &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n          &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-compiler-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n          &lt;version&gt;3.11.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n        &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n          &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-jar-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n          &lt;version&gt;3.3.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n        &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n          &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-dependency-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n          &lt;version&gt;3.6.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n        &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n          &lt;groupId&gt;org.panteleyev&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n          &lt;artifactId&gt;jpackage-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n          &lt;version&gt;1.6.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n      &lt;/plugins&gt;\r\n    &lt;/pluginManagement&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;plugins&gt;\r\n      &lt;!-- \r\n        Configure JAR plugin to set Main-Class entry in the JAR&#39;s manifest.

If you don&#39;t want to install WiX 3.x.x just for running the example, then change the type to `&lt;type&gt;APP_IMAGE&lt;/type&gt;`. You won&#39;t get an installer file, but you&#39;ll end up with an application image that you can run as is.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Executable JAR\r\n\r\nYou can create an executable fat/uber/shadowed JAR file with JavaFX via Maven using the [Maven Shade Plugin][1]. Note this will inherently put everything on the class-path. Any code that relies explicitly on modules may break with this setup, though such code is rare. Additionally, JavaFX does not technically support being loaded from the class-path. Doing so will not break anything as of JavaFX 21, as far as I know, but any issues caused by this configuration are unlikely to be fixed by the JavaFX developers.\r\n\r\nSee [David Weber&#39;s answer][2] for an example using the Maven Shade Plugin.\r\n\r\nIf you want to go with a shadowed executable JAR file as your deployment strategy, then I suggest you forgo creating an installer. Just have your end user install the appropriate version of Java (you can send them the installer for that), and then they can just double-click the JAR file to make it run. Make sure your end user enables associating `*.jar` files with Java if the Java installer gives that option.\r\n\r\nIf you want a cross-platform executable JAR file, you&#39;ll have to declare a JavaFX dependency for each platform manually. JavaFX relies on platform-specific native code, and the Maven artifacts embed that native code in the JAR file, but only for a particular platform. For instance, `javafx-graphics-21.0.1-win.jar` contains native code for Windows, but not Linux or macOS.\r\n\r\nNote that when JavaFX is on the class-path, as is the case here, then your main class **cannot** be a subclass of `javafx.application.Application`. You **must** have a separate &quot;launcher class&quot; as the main class. Something like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage sample;\r\n\r\nimport javafx.application.Application;\r\n\r\npublic class Launcher {\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Application.launch(YourAppClass.class, args);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/77407480/6395627\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/specs/man/jpackage.html\r\n  [4]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77403261/javafx-how-to-compile-uber-jar-with-maven-and-create-a-installer?noredirect=1#comment136458427_77403261\r\n  [5]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/jpackage/packaging-overview.html\r\n  [6]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/specs/man/jlink.html\r\n  [7]: https://github.panteleyev.org/jpackage-maven-plugin/index.html\r\n  [8]: https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/\r\n  [9]: https://gluonhq.com/create-native-javafx-applications-using-graalvm-22-builds-from-gluon/\r\n  [10]: https://bell-sw.com/announcements/2022/08/24/turning-javafx-apps-into-native-images/","title":"JavaFX - How to compile uber jar with maven and create a installer?","body":"<h1>Self-Contained Application</h1>\n<p>Your desire to create an installer lends itself to creating an entirely self-contained application.

It comes with the JDK since version 16. See the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/jpackage/packaging-overview.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Packaging Tool User Guide</a> for more information. It would also help to understand <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/specs/man/jlink.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>jlink</code></a>, as <code>jpackage</code> will either use <code>jlink</code> &quot;behind the scenes&quot; to generate a custom run-time image, or you'll use <code>jlink</code> explicitly and then provide <code>jpackage</code> with the custom run-time image.</p>\n<p>One significant downside to using <code>jpackage</code>, however, is that it can only create application images and installers for the operating system it is running on. If you want a Windows application, then you'll have to build your project on Windows, with the same being true for Linux and macOS. And as <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77403261/javafx-how-to-compile-uber-jar-with-maven-and-create-a-installer?noredirect=1#comment136458427_77403261\">jewelsea explains in a comment</a>, there are also platform-specific issues you'll have to resolve:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Creating installers for multiple platforms is tricky and each platform has its own quirks you need to work with. For example, Windows requires increasing versions for updates, OS X requires (paid I believe) developer signing certs. So be prepared to spend some time and (probably) a bit of money to create the installers. Though there are existing guides, such as those I referenced, there will probably still be some platform and app-specific quirks you will need to work through on your own with limited outside help.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you're going to create a self-contained application, then I would suggest you forgo creating a fat/uber/shadowed JAR file. A self-contained application already contains all dependencies, so a shadowed JAR file is unlikely to provide any benefits. Plus, if you're going to be using <code>jpackage</code> to create the installer, you might as well design your entire deployment around <code>jpackage</code> from the start.</p>\n<p>Using Maven profiles can solve a lot of the platform-specific configuration issues. While any remaining platform-specific configuration, as well as building the application on multiple platforms and publishing it automatically, can likely be accomplished with some kind of CI/CD pipeline. Though remember to <strong>never</strong> commit any secrets to your VCS (e.g., Git), which by extension means do not put any secrets in the POM file(s).</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p>Here is a POM that is configured to create an <code>msi</code> installer file when the <code>windows</code> profile is activated. Note there is only configurations for Windows in this example.

If you don't want to install WiX 3.x.x just for running the example, then change the type to <code>&lt;type&gt;APP_IMAGE&lt;/type&gt;</code>. You won't get an installer file, but you'll end up with an application image that you can run as is.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Executable JAR</h1>\n<p>You can create an executable fat/uber/shadowed JAR file with JavaFX via Maven using the <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maven Shade Plugin</a>. Note this will inherently put everything on the class-path. Any code that relies explicitly on modules may break with this setup, though such code is rare. Additionally, JavaFX does not technically support being loaded from the class-path. Doing so will not break anything as of JavaFX 21, as far as I know, but any issues caused by this configuration are unlikely to be fixed by the JavaFX developers.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/77407480/6395627\">David Weber's answer</a> for an example using the Maven Shade Plugin.</p>\n<p>If you want to go with a shadowed executable JAR file as your deployment strategy, then I suggest you forgo creating an installer. Just have your end user install the appropriate version of Java (you can send them the installer for that), and then they can just double-click the JAR file to make it run. Make sure your end user enables associating <code>*.jar</code> files with Java if the Java installer gives that option.</p>\n<p>If you want a cross-platform executable JAR file, you'll have to declare a JavaFX dependency for each platform manually. JavaFX relies on platform-specific native code, and the Maven artifacts embed that native code in the JAR file, but only for a particular platform. For instance, <code>javafx-graphics-21.0.1-win.jar</code> contains native code for Windows, but not Linux or macOS.</p>\n<p>Note that when JavaFX is on the class-path, as is the case here, then your main class <strong>cannot</strong> be a subclass of <code>javafx.application.Application</code>. You <strong>must</strong> have a separate &quot;launcher class&quot; as the main class. Something like:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>package sample;\n\nimport javafx.application.Application;\n\npublic class Launcher {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Application.launch(YourAppClass.class, args);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":29799413,"reputation":13,"user_id":22837527,"display_name":"Bruno B."},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":169,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":77410196,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1698989108,"creation_date":1698847880,"question_id":77403261,"body_markdown":"I need to compile a JavaFX 20 application into an executable Jar file that includes all the dependencies listed in the pom.xml (including javaFX itself and all the other JAR files).

User clicks on song from RecyclerView (previous screen) which Intent goes to `NewEditSongActivity` the parameter `song_uri` is passed\r\n 2. onCreate() (variables assigned, receive Intent for uri and stored in `uriString`)\r\n 3. check for `uriString` != null\r\n 4. check if the app has permission to read files from the external storage - which passes and processing continues\r\n 5. calling openFile() which processing goes to however after `InputStream inputStream = null;` is set the processing stops at the try/catch blocks\r\n\r\nBased upon **Elnur&#39;s** comment.  I tried, just to see what happened using `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - added this to the manifest:\r\n```\r\n&lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE&quot; /&gt;\r\n```\r\n...but received the same error:\r\n```\r\nPermission Denial: opening provider com.android.externalstorage.ExternalStorageProvider from ProcessRecord{8374b4e 31718:com.enetapplications.songtracker/u0a540} (pid=31718, uid=10540) requires that you obtain access using ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT or related APIs\r\n``` \r\nOne more thing I tried, just to see if I could get the code to work was re-build the app using `Android 5.0 - API level 21` and adjusted the `build.gradle` with:\r\n```\r\nminSdkVersion 21 //was at 29\r\n```\r\nI synced and rebuilt and ran the app but the SAME issue with `Permission Denial`.

However, the following code</p>\n<pre><code>Object[] s = new Integer[10];\nString[] test = (String[])s;\n</code></pre>\n<p>can still be compiled (due to the rules above), but will result in a <code>ClassCastException</code> as expected.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":23674217,"reputation":3,"user_id":17700638,"display_name":"K6J4"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1698965417,"creation_date":1698957692,"question_id":77412771,"body_markdown":"I know that in runtime something like this could throw a ClassCastException because Object is not a subclass of String.\r\n\r\n    String[] test = (String[]) new Object[10];\r\n\t\r\nBut I want to know why something like this is not detected when compiling?","title":"Why does the compiler not detect ClassCastException?","body":"<p>I know that in runtime something like this could throw a ClassCastException because Object is not a subclass of String.</p>\n<pre><code>String[] test = (String[]) new Object[10];\n</code></pre>\n<p>But I want to know why something like this is not detected when compiling?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","lambda","java-stream"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":213468,"reputation":103500,"user_id":466862,"display_name":"Mark Rotteveel"},"score":7,"creation_date":1656925875,"post_id":72854254,"comment_id":128681384,"body_markdown":"Is there a particular reason to use streams for this?

Otherwise use the fully qualiefied name and put it somewere like /home/{user}/files/x.pdf.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":357630,"reputation":10123,"user_id":697911,"accept_rate":53,"display_name":"user697911"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":8412,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1698962710,"creation_date":1484776614,"question_id":41730191,"body_markdown":"I have a maven project with these standard directory structures:\r\n\r\nsrc/main/java\r\n\r\nsrc/main/java/pdf/Pdf.java\r\n\r\nsrc/test/resources\r\n\r\nsrc/test/resources/files/x.pdf\r\n\r\nIn my Pdf.java, \r\n\t\r\n    File file = new File(&quot;../../../test/resources/files/x.pdf&quot;);\r\n\r\nWhy does it report &quot;No such file or dirctory&quot;?

Just like this:\r\n\r\n[Adding Maven support][1]\r\n\r\nOn the new window you just select Web Application and Maven from the list of available Frameworks. When selecting Web Application it creates a `web` package and its `web.xml` configuration file. When asked, accept creating the web.xml file to proceed. After these steps your project structure might look like this:\r\n\r\n[Project structure after adding Maven and Web application frameworks][2]\r\n\r\n**Adding Java Servlet API dependency to pom.xml**\r\n\r\nNow you need to open the `pom.xml` file. This file helps you to add and manage your project dependencies as it allows you to retrieve them from the Apache Maven repository instead of downloading the JAR files and adding them manually to your project. You need to add the next dependency:\r\n\r\n    &lt;dependencies&gt;\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;javax.servlet&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;javax.servlet-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;4.0.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n    &lt;/dependencies&gt;\r\n\r\nYour pom file should look like this after the previous step:\r\n\r\n[Adding Java Servlet API dependency][3]\r\n\r\nAs final step, we need to open the `Project Structure` settings by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S` or by navigating through `File &gt; Project Structure`. Here we are going to find a `Project Settings` section on the left side of the window. We need to go to `Facets` and you may find a facet named `Web`. On the bottom of the window you should see an option called `Source Roots`. You have to enable it by clicking the checkbox, then click `Apply` and finally `OK`. You have to make sure that path shown in this section is indeed the path to your projects&#39; `src &gt; main &gt; java` folder.\r\n\r\n[Marking folder as source root][4]\r\n\r\nOnce you&#39;ve done that, you should be able to go to any package in your project and create a servlet as follows: `New &gt; Servlet`.\r\n\r\n[Creating servlet][5]\r\n\r\n**Note:** if you got a syntax error when `pom.xml` file was created the only thing you need to do is to change the `&lt;groupId&gt;&lt;/groupId&gt;` tag content to a fully qualified name you want your project to be identified by.\r\n\r\n[Given your project a qualified name][6]\r\n\r\n**Note:** I wasn&#39;t able to find a way to configure permanently the `src &gt; main &gt; java` folder as source root, so every time you close and reopen your project you need to go to `Project Structure (Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S) &gt; Facets &gt; Web` and mark it as source root again.

You have to make sure that path shown in this section is indeed the path to your projects' <code>src &gt; main &gt; java</code> folder.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WUJ7D.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Marking folder as source root</a></p>\n<p>Once you've done that, you should be able to go to any package in your project and create a servlet as follows: <code>New &gt; Servlet</code>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GhumM.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Creating servlet</a></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you got a syntax error when <code>pom.xml</code> file was created the only thing you need to do is to change the <code>&lt;groupId&gt;&lt;/groupId&gt;</code> tag content to a fully qualified name you want your project to be identified by.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VzzYm.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Given your project a qualified name</a></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I wasn't able to find a way to configure permanently the <code>src &gt; main &gt; java</code> folder as source root, so every time you close and reopen your project you need to go to <code>Project Structure (Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S) &gt; Facets &gt; Web</code> and mark it as source root again.

much appreciated thanks.
