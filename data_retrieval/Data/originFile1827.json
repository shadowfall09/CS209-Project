Since I also needed information on how to combine with saxon - here are the modifications for saxon, on a windows box, with a catalog file. \r\n\r\nHere is how I run an XSLT through the saxon command line on my computer (where FilePath is system dependent):\r\n\r\n    java -cp &quot;C:\\FilePath\\saxon9ee.jar;C:\\FilePath\\resolver.jar&quot;;. net.sf.saxon.Transform -s:inputFile.xml  -o:outputFile.xml  -xsl:C:\\FilePath\\transform.xsl -catalog:&quot;C:\\FilePath\\catalog.xml&quot; \r\n\r\nThe big thing to point out here is that when you are using a catalog file with Saxon you have to point it back to the resolver.jar file.\r\n\r\nSo with \r\n\r\n    XSLT = java -cp &quot;C:\\FilePath\\saxon9ee.jar;C:\\FilePath\\resolver.jar&quot;;. net.sf.saxon.Transform -catalog:&quot;C:\\FilePath\\catalog.xml&quot;\r\n\r\nThen the info from the website makes sense (having found the necessary xsl files in oXygen):\r\n\r\n     XSLT -input=xxx.sch  -output=xxx1.sch  -stylesheet=iso_dsdl_include.xsl\r\n     XSLT -input=xxx1.sch  -output=xxx2.sch  -stylesheet=iso_abstract_expand.xsl\r\n     XSLT -input=xxx2.sch  -output=xxx.xsl  -stylesheet=iso_svrl.xsl\r\n     XSLT -input=document.xml  -output=xxx-document.svrl  -stylesheet=xxx.xsl\r\n\r\nYou are taking the schematron file, running it through three transforms to get out an xsl file that you then run on the original xml document.

Since I also needed information on how to combine with saxon - here are the modifications for saxon, on a windows box, with a catalog file. </p>\n\n<p>Here is how I run an XSLT through the saxon command line on my computer (where FilePath is system dependent):</p>\n\n<pre><code>java -cp \"C:\\FilePath\\saxon9ee.jar;C:\\FilePath\\resolver.jar\";. net.sf.saxon.Transform -s:inputFile.xml  -o:outputFile.xml  -xsl:C:\\FilePath\\transform.xsl -catalog:\"C:\\FilePath\\catalog.xml\" \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The big thing to point out here is that when you are using a catalog file with Saxon you have to point it back to the resolver.jar file.</p>\n\n<p>So with </p>\n\n<pre><code>XSLT = java -cp \"C:\\FilePath\\saxon9ee.jar;C:\\FilePath\\resolver.jar\";. net.sf.saxon.Transform -catalog:\"C:\\FilePath\\catalog.xml\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then the info from the website makes sense (having found the necessary xsl files in oXygen):</p>\n\n<pre><code> XSLT -input=xxx.sch  -output=xxx1.sch  -stylesheet=iso_dsdl_include.xsl\n XSLT -input=xxx1.sch  -output=xxx2.sch  -stylesheet=iso_abstract_expand.xsl\n XSLT -input=xxx2.sch  -output=xxx.xsl  -stylesheet=iso_svrl.xsl\n XSLT -input=document.xml  -output=xxx-document.svrl  -stylesheet=xxx.xsl\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You are taking the schematron file, running it through three transforms to get out an xsl file that you then run on the original xml document. This actually makes it relatively easy to script.</p>\n\n<p>The last command has never actually populated an output file for me.

Then, once the plugins had been successfully installed, just revert to using your JDK &gt;= 14. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/68043338/2985643\">That approach is documented in great detail here</a>. Most of the individual steps in that answer remain valid, but there is no longer any need to revert to running NetBeans on a JDK &lt; 14 because there is a simpler approach available.</p>\n<p>When running NetBeans 12.5 on a JDK &gt;= 14, the plugin installer now detects that <strong>unpack200.exe</strong> is missing after downloading the plugins, and invites you to provide an instance of it:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cR3Az.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cR3Az.png\" alt=\"chooseunpack200\" /></a></p>\n<p>Clicking the <strong>Choose Unpack200...</strong> button in the lower left of that screen opens the following dialog:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EV2zb.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EV2zb.png\" alt=\"selectFile\" /></a></p>\n<p>Navigate to any instance of <strong>unpack200.exe</strong> on your machine. It will reside in the <strong>bin</strong> directory for any JDK release &lt; 14. Once the plugin installer has located an instance of <strong>unpack200.exe</strong> it can convert the downloaded plugins into jar files to complete the plugin installation process.</p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Although this question is about the Java ME plugins, the same\napproach applies when running NetBeans on a JDK &gt;= 14, and installing any plugin that uses the Pack200/Unpack200 APIs.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>NetBeans asking for a location of <strong>unpack200.exe</strong> only happens once. Thereafter it uses the location you provided initially by default.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":9708065,"reputation":160,"user_id":7200911,"accept_rate":11,"display_name":"ramen87x"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":889,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":70077631,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1637656685,"creation_date":1637227164,"question_id":70017256,"body_markdown":"Below is what I&#39;m using,\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS Big Sur \r\n- NetBeans: 12.5\r\n- Java: 7 / 8 / 17\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to install Java Me plugin[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon installation, i kept getting this[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/XBohN.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/goKi4.png\r\n\r\n\r\nI have tried using java 7, 8 and 17 (I&#39;m using jenv to control java version)..

`com.microsoft.bot.builder.ActivityHandler` class:\r\n\r\n    Object obj = activity.getValue();\r\n    JsonNode node = null;\r\n    if (obj instanceof JsonNode) {\r\n      node = (JsonNode) obj;\r\n    } else {\r\n      AdaptiveCardInvokeResponse response = createAdaptiveCardInvokeErrorResponse(\r\n          HttpURLConnection.HTTP_BAD_REQUEST, &quot;BadRequest&quot;, &quot;Value property instanceof not properly formed&quot;);\r\n      throw new InvokeResponseException(HttpURLConnection.HTTP_BAD_REQUEST, response);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFrom this code I can see that a `InvokeResponseException` will be thrown if the `activity.getValue()` object is not an instance of `JsonNode`.\r\n\r\nI went so far as to pull this code out into my own class and logged out the actual object type that was being returned:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Object obj = activity.getValue();\r\n    JsonNode node = null;\r\n    LOGGER.error(&quot;obj type: &quot; + obj.getClass().getName());\r\n    if (obj instanceof JsonNode) {\r\n      node = (JsonNode) obj;\r\n    } else {\r\n      AdaptiveCardInvokeResponse response = createAdaptiveCardInvokeErrorResponse(\r\n          HttpURLConnection.HTTP_BAD_REQUEST, &quot;BadRequest&quot;, &quot;Value property instanceof not properly formed&quot;);\r\n      throw new InvokeResponseException(HttpURLConnection.HTTP_BAD_REQUEST, response);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe actual object type is `java.util.LinkedHashMap`.\r\n\r\nSo what is the solution here? Is there a configuration option that changes how the activity responses are deserialized by a standard chat bot project? I was basing my code off the sample project created with Yeoman `yo botbuilder-java -T &quot;echo&quot;` described [here][2].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

this code in the <code>com.microsoft.bot.builder.ActivityHandler</code> class:</p>\n<pre><code>Object obj = activity.getValue();\nJsonNode node = null;\nif (obj instanceof JsonNode) {\n  node = (JsonNode) obj;\n} else {\n  AdaptiveCardInvokeResponse response = createAdaptiveCardInvokeErrorResponse(\n      HttpURLConnection.HTTP_BAD_REQUEST, &quot;BadRequest&quot;, &quot;Value property

<code>InvokeResponseException</code> will be thrown if the <code>activity.getValue()</code> object is not an instance of <code>JsonNode</code>.</p>\n<p>I went so far as to pull this code out into my own class and logged out the actual object type that was being returned:</p>\n<pre><code>Object obj = activity.getValue();\nJsonNode node = null;\nLOGGER.error(&quot;obj type: &quot; + obj.getClass().getName());\nif (obj instanceof JsonNode) {\n  node = (JsonNode) obj;\n} else {\n  AdaptiveCardInvokeResponse response = createAdaptiveCardInvokeErrorResponse(\n

developer evangelist here.\r\n\r\nThe documentation [describes how the signature is created][1] and that may show up some differences in the way you are testing. On your server, the algorithm to check the signature is:\r\n\r\n&gt; 1. Take the full URL of the request URL you specify for your phone number or app, from the protocol (https...) through the end of the query string (everything after the ?).\r\n&gt; 2. If the request is a POST, sort all of the POST parameters alphabetically (using Unix-style case-sensitive sorting order).\r\n&gt; 3. Iterate through the sorted list of POST parameters, and append the variable name and value (with no delimiters) to the end of the URL string.\r\n&gt; 4. Sign the resulting string with HMAC-SHA1 using your AuthToken as the key (remember, your AuthToken&#39;s case matters!).\r\n&gt; 5. Base64 encode the resulting hash value.\r\n&gt; 6. Compare your hash to ours, submitted in the X-Twilio-Signature header. If they match, then you&#39;re good to go.\r\n\r\nYou are using `GET` requests, so you can discard steps 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nThere are some things I can see from this algorithm that might cause differences in the way you are testing the validator.\r\n\r\nYour error from testing in real life used the URL `https://my-gcr-server.run.app/twilio`, but your test script from a real request uses `https://my-gcr-server.run.app/voicemail/transcript`. The URL matters in the generation of the signature.\r\n\r\nYour test also adds query parameters to the request, but it&#39;s hard to know what the order of those params will be. The order of the query params in the URL should be the exact same as the URL Twilio made the request to.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the original Twilio request was a `POST` request, then those parameters should be added as form parameters, as the algorithm takes the form parameters, sorts them and appends them to the URL, with no delimiters.\r\n\r\nYou said:\r\n\r\n&gt; There is also an issue where if a request is &#39;modified&#39;, for example if I set a Twilio callback URL to include a query param, e.g. https://my-gcr-server.app.run/twilio/callback?type=recording, then the Twilio signature ignores this parameter, but when validating the auth it&#39;s impossible to know which parameters Twilio is ignoring. The same is true if the headers are altered.\r\n\r\nThis is not true, a query param is part of the URL, as I&#39;ve said above. Twilio does not ignore parameters, it deals with them according to the algorithm described above. As for headers, aside from the `X-Twilio-Signature` which is used to test the signature against, they do not come into play.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that, I am not sure why a real life request would fail the validator as it should be handling all of the things I have discussed above. You can inspect the code used to [validate a request][2] and [get a signature][3].\r\n\r\nIn your code:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\n      val uri: String = request.uri.toString()\r\n      val paramMap: Map&lt;String, String?&gt; = request.form().toMap()\r\n\r\n      logger.info { &quot;Validating request with uri: $uri, paramMap: $paramMap, signature: $requestSignature&quot; }\r\n      val isTwilioSignatureValid = twilioValidator.validate(uri, paramMap, requestSignature)\r\n      logger.info { &quot;Request Twilio valid: $isTwilioSignatureValid&quot; }\r\n      isTwilioSignatureValid\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan you guarantee that the `uri` is indeed the original URL that Twilio made the request to, not a URL that has been parsed into parts and put back together with the query parameters in a different order? In a `GET` request, does `request.form().toMap()` return an empty `Map`?\r\n\r\nSorry this isn&#39;t a full answer, I&#39;m not much of a Java/Kotlin developer.
