Again to repeat, the issue im having is that the smallest and largest come back as 0's no matter what.</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.util.Scanner;\npublic class LargestAndSmallest {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int smallest = 0;\n        int large = 0;\n        int num;\n        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.println(\"Enter the numer\");\n        int n = keyboard.nextInt();\n        num = keyboard.nextInt();\n        while (n != -99) {\n            System.out.println(\"Enter more numbers, or -99 to quit\");\n            n = keyboard.nextInt();\n        }\n\n        for (int i = 2; i &lt; n; i++) {\n            num = keyboard.nextInt();\n\n            if (num &gt; large) {\n                large = num;\n                System.out.println(large);\n            }\n\n            if (num &lt; smallest) {\n                smallest = num;\n            }\n        }\n        System.out.println(\"the largest is \" + large);\n        System.out.println(\"the smallest is \" + smallest);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I used this code as in the first place: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21925830/java-program-to-find-the-largest-smallest-number-in-n-numbers-without-using-ar\">Java program to find the largest &amp; smallest number in n numbers without using arrays</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","android-studio","kotlin"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":13920211,"reputation":23,"user_id":12132123,"display_name":"Frigglefrack"},"score":0,"creation_date":1569609038,"post_id":58139525,"comment_id":102666045,"body_markdown":"Wait, I believe my main activity file is currently a koltin file and not a java file and maybe thats the issue.","body":"Wait, I believe my main activity file is currently a koltin file and not a java file and maybe thats the issue."},{"owner":{"account_id":16733018,"reputation":2142,"user_id":12094894,"display_name":"Simon Crane"},"score":0,"creation_date":1569609088,"post_id":58139525,"comment_id":102666065,"body_markdown":"Yes that would cause this issue - I assumed it was Java because of the syntax","body":"Yes that would cause this issue - I assumed it was Java because of the syntax"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3009039,"reputation":3370,"user_id":3556531,"display_name":"KeshavDulal"},"score":0,"creation_date":1634578330,"post_id":58139654,"comment_id":123057486,"body_markdown":"Give this man a raise! &#128588;","body":"Give this man a raise! 🙌"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":10901274,"reputation":4076,"user_id":8013471,"display_name":"cse"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":9,"is_accepted":true,"score":9,"last_activity_date":1665218099,"creation_date":1569608197,"answer_id":58139654,"question_id":58139525,"body_markdown":"The problem is due to incorrect syntax.

And you will see that a mouse click can generate up to three events: one for the press, one for the release and one if pressing and releasing happened at the same location which is considered a <em>click</em>.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":2985035,"reputation":8984,"user_id":2534090,"accept_rate":34,"display_name":"JavaTechnical"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":4283,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":2,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1665183862,"creation_date":1391420461,"question_id":21523883,"body_markdown":"I have the following piece of code\r\n\r\n    import java.awt.*;\r\n    import java.awt.event.*;\r\n    import java.lang.reflect.*;\r\n    import javax.swing.*;\r\n    class QueueTest {\r\n    static int i=0;\r\n        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, \r\n    \r\n    InvocationTargetException {\r\n            EventQueue eventQueue = \r\n    \r\n    Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getSystemEventQueue();\r\n            eventQueue.push(new MyEventQueue());\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \tFrame f=new Frame();\r\n    \tf.setSize(400,400);\r\n    \t//f.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\r\n    \tf.setLocation(150,150);\r\n    \tf.setLayout(new FlowLayout());\r\n    \tf.setVisible(true);\r\n    \r\n    \tButton b=new Button(&quot;button&quot;);\r\n    \t//b.setEnabled(false);\r\n    \tf.add(b);\r\n    /*\r\n    \tb.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){\r\n    \t\tpublic void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae)\r\n    \t\t{\r\n    \t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;button is clicked&quot;);\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t});\r\n    */\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        private static class MyEventQueue extends EventQueue {\r\n            public void postEvent(AWTEvent theEvent) {\r\n    //            System.out.println(&quot;Event Posted&quot;);\r\n      System.out.println(&quot;The source of event is &quot;+theEvent.getSource());\r\n                super.postEvent(theEvent);\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n    \tprotected void dispatchEvent(AWTEvent event)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \tSystem.out.println(&quot;The source of event (&quot;+(i++)+&quot;) is \r\n    \r\n    &quot;+event.getSource());\r\n    \tsuper.dispatchEvent(event);\r\n    \t}\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the output i could sometimes see\r\n\r\n`The source of event is (78) sun.awt.windows.WToolkit@77ef83`\r\n\r\nwhen I think i have only two sources, the `java.awt.Button` and the `java.awt.Frame`.
