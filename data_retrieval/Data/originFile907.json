This requires to unroll the loop, and the iteration is only suggested by repeating the same interaction  with each observer, one after the other.   You may add a comment to explain the general looping logic and reinforce the idea by putting some suspension points `...` here and there.  \r\n\r\n### Technique 2: placeholder\r\n\r\nThis is what you did.

It should have a generic name to suggest the iterative character, such as *`observerN`*.  \r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure that it&#39;s legal to have a lifeline local to a fragment. I think the UML metamodel requires the lifelines to be owned by the diagram and that the loop fragment only tells if it covers the lifeline or not. It&#39;s also confusing to destroy the instance in the loop. I&#39;d therefore reduce the width of the `loop` fragment in a way not to include `observerN`, since it&#39;s not the same observer throughout the loop.  \r\n\r\nThen it must be explained how the observer comes into play.  Within the loop, you could visualise somehow that the subject gets the next observer , e.g. using an interaction that returns `observerN`, a message to self to get the next observer, or a comment.  \r\nYou could also reinforce this semantic by adding a constraint to the lifeline `{ observerN is element of subject.observerList }`.  \r\n\r\n### Better alternative: communication diagram \r\n\r\nThe communication diagram provide a better support for iteration with a variable number of instances, via an ***iteration clause***, that can be placed after a message sequence number.  It has the format: `*[iteration-clause]`\r\n\r\nUML defines it as follows:  \r\n\r\n&gt; An iteration represents a sequence of Messages at the given nesting depth. The iteration clause may be omitted (in which case the iteration conditions are unspecified). The iteration-clause is meant to be expressed in pseudocode or an actual programming language, UML does not prescribe its format.

Instead, it need to return a tuple (`[row, col]`). Since Java does not have `Tuple` as a data type, you will have to create your own. You can use an array, or you can use a class that represent a tuple. An easy way to do this is by using a Java record.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic record Tuple(int row, int col){}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf using this approach, your code will have to be modified something like this:\r\n```\r\npublic static Tuple findHighestRow(double[][] grid) {\r\n        int i, j;\r\n        double sum = 0;\r\n        double average = 0;\r\n        double averageGreater = 0;\r\n        \r\n        for (i = 0; i &lt; grid.length; i++) {\r\n            for (j = 0; j &lt; grid[i].length; j++) {\r\n                sum = sum + grid[i][j];\r\n            }\r\n            average=sum/grid[i].length;\r\n            sum=0;\r\n            averageGreater = Math.max(average, sum / grid[i].length);\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Average of row &quot; + (i+1) + &quot; = &quot; + average);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        System.out.println(&quot; row with highest average is &quot; + (i) + &quot; = &quot; + averageGreater);\r\n        \r\n        int k, l;\r\n        double sum2 = 0;\r\n        double average2 = 0;\r\n        double averageGreater2 = 0;\r\n        \r\n        for (k = 0; k &lt; grid.length; k++) {\r\n            for (l = 0; l &lt; grid[k].length; l++) {\r\n                sum2=sum2+grid[k][l];\r\n            }\r\n            average2=sum2/grid[k].length;\r\n            sum2 = 0;\r\n            averageGreater2 = Math.max(average2, sum2 / grid[k].length);\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Average of column &quot; + (k+1) + &quot; = &quot; + average2);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        System.out.println(&quot; column with highest average is &quot; + (k) + &quot; = &quot; + averageGreater2);\r\n        return new Tuple(i, k);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nI&#39;m also convinced there is a better algorithm to find these rows and columns. This looks like a brute force solution to me. That said, I just wanted to focus on your immediate issue. I am no algorithm expert, but I think if you create a POJO that captures a tuple of `[row, col]` and the value in a list or array, you can then much easier return the max value in your list rather than iterate again through the same 2D array twice. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n3, 2, 1\r\n4, 5, 9\r\n7, 8, 6 \r\n```\r\nGiven a 2D array like the one above, you can capture the following data after one pass in a list of `MyPojo` objects\r\n```\r\nMyPojo: [0,0], 3\r\nMyPojo: [1,2], 9\r\nMyPojo: [2,1], 8\r\n```\r\nThen all you have to do is provide a method in `MyPojo` that returns the tuple of the highest value.

But, first, the unreachable statement: \r\n\r\n\r\nPart 1: Unreachable Statement\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nConsider the first part of your code, which has this in the middle:\r\n\r\n     ... \r\n     System.out.println(&quot; row with highest average is &quot; + (i) \r\n                      + &quot; = &quot; + averageGreater);\r\n     return averageGreater;\r\n     ...\r\n\r\n\r\nExecution of that `return` statement is unavoidable: It  is not subject to an `if` or other conditional flow control.\r\n\r\nExecution of a `return` statement terminates execution of the method that contains it. Because reaching that `return` is unavoidable, the code below it cannot be executed. That causes the &quot;unreachable statement&quot; error.\r\n\r\nPart 2: How to convert the result into a string.\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYou say you &quot;do not know how to convert the result into a string.&quot;\r\n\r\nYou actually _do_ know how to do that. You&#39;ve done it in your code.\r\n\r\nConsider, for example,  this statement, from your code:\r\n\r\n     System.out.println(&quot; row with highest average is &quot; + (i) \r\n                            + &quot; = &quot; + averageGreater);\r\n\r\n`System.out` is an instance of a [`PrintStream`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html). The overloaded `println` method you are using is taking a `String` argument. That&#39;s a __single__ `String`, not four `String`. \r\n\r\nSo, how does that work?  Although `String` is a class, the Java compiler provides special support for it, which includes overloading `+` to act as a `String` concatenation operator. When used on a primitive, the `+` is overloaded to convert the primitive to a `String`.

So the one that has the &quot;1&quot;-prefix in your file will actually be the one you get with mapa.get(0).</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":14865576,"reputation":9,"user_id":10734814,"display_name":"Grefuwan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1667676272,"creation_date":1667675069,"question_id":74330707,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to read a file which contains the structure PointID CoordX CoordY, like this:\r\n\r\n    1 565.0 575.0\r\n    2 25.0 185.0\r\n    3 345.0 750.0\r\n    4 945.0 685.0\r\n    5 845.0 655.0\r\n\r\nWhere PointID should be the ID of that dot. \r\n\r\nThen, I have to create a Punto object following this structure:\r\n   \r\n    Punto p1 = new Punto(16.47, 36.10);\r\n    Punto p2 = new Punto(16.47, 280.44);\r\n    Punto p3 = new Punto(115.09, 92.54);\r\n    Punto p4 = new Punto(364.39, 197.37);\r\n\r\nI came to this solution:\r\n\r\n    public ArrayList&lt;Punto&gt; puntosFichero(File fich) throws Exception {\r\n      String numPunto = &quot;&quot;;\r\n      String cordX = &quot;&quot;;\r\n      String cordY = &quot;&quot;;\r\n      String tmp = &quot;&quot;;\r\n\r\n      ArrayList&lt;Punto&gt; mapa = new ArrayList();\r\n\r\n      //Opens the file\r\n      try {\r\n          scannerLectura = new Scanner(fich);\r\n      } catch (Exception e) {\r\n          throw new Exception(&quot;Error: Abrir fichero&quot;);\r\n      }\r\n        \r\n      //Reads the file and sets the ArrayList\r\n      while(scannerLectura.hasNext()){\r\n              tmp = scannerLectura.next();\r\n              if (tmp.contentEquals(&quot;NODE_COORD_SECTION&quot;)){\r\n                  while(!tmp.contentEquals(&quot;EOF&quot;)){\r\n                      numPunto = scannerLectura.next(); //P(numPunto)\r\n                      cordX = scannerLectura.next();    //CordX\r\n                      cordY = scannerLectura.next();    //CordY\r\n                      System.out.println(&quot;Punto &quot; + numPunto + &quot;: [&quot; + cordX + &quot; , &quot; + cordY + &quot;]&quot;);\r\n                    \r\n                      Punto (Object)numPunto = new Punto (Double.parseDouble(cordX), Double.parseDouble(cordY));\r\n                    \r\n                      mapa.add(Integer.parseInt(numPunto));\r\n                  }\r\n              }\r\n            \r\n          }\r\n        \r\n          //Closes the file\r\n          scannerLectura.close();\r\n          return mapa;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut when I try to create a new Punto here:\r\n\r\n&gt;     Punto (Object)numPunto = new Punto (Double.parseDouble(cordX), Double.parseDouble(cordY));\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t use the string &quot;numPunto&quot; as its name.

You basically need to get the bytes into an int type depending on the order of the bytes, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    int asInt = (bytes[0] &amp; 0xFF) \r\n                | ((bytes[1] &amp; 0xFF) &lt;&lt; 8) \r\n                | ((bytes[2] &amp; 0xFF) &lt;&lt; 16) \r\n                | ((bytes[3] &amp; 0xFF) &lt;&lt; 24);\r\n\r\nThen you can transform to a float using this:\r\n\r\n    float asFloat = Float.intBitsToFloat(asInt);\r\n\r\nThis is basically what `DataInputStream` does under the covers, but it assumes your bytes are in a certain order.\r\n\r\nEdit - On Bitwise OR\r\n---\r\nThe OP asked for clarification on what bitwise OR does in this case.
