In the inner loop we move the element starting at i down by swapping neigbours. But this answer swaps neighbours by making i smaller, even though the array was about to be sorted up to i. So it works but it does extra work because you have to loop through the outer loop to get i back up to where it just was. Notice that in this inner loop j is always i-1 so you swap element i with i-1. You should just start j at i and swap j with j-1 and leave i alone. See my updated answer.","body":"@HarshKanakhara In the outer loop the array is sorted below i and we make i larger. In the inner loop we move the element starting at i down by swapping neigbours. But this answer swaps neighbours by making i smaller, even though the array was about to be sorted up to i.

Oracle was using the Oracle Binary Code License (OBCL) for Java.  This had field of use restrictions (you needed a commercial license for embedded use) but granted free use of the Oracle JDK for general purpose development and deployment.\r\n 2. As of JDK 11, the license changed to the Oracle Technology Network License Agreement (OTNLA), which requires you to purchase a Java SE Subscription for use in commercial production.  This license has also been applied to updates of JDK 8 since April (update 211/212).\r\n 3. As of JDK 11, Oracle eliminated all functional differences between the Oracle JDK and a binary built purely from the OpenJDK source code.  The important things no longer in the Oracle JDK 11 are the browser plugin, Java Web Start and JavaFX.\r\n 4. You can continue to use any public Oracle binaries of JDK 7 (and earlier) in production without the need for a Java SE subscription, as the license is still the OBCL (it has not been changed retrospectively).  You can also, as you say, use JDK 8 up to update 202 under the OBCL without cost.\r\n 5. There are several options for continuing to use JDK 8 with updates for free.  One of those is Zulu Community from Azul (who I work for).  This is a free, TCK-tested binary with a couple of additional backported features (TLS 1.3 and Java Flight Recorder).  Since this passes the TCK, from a functional perspective, it is identical to the Oracle JDK.  Unless you are using Applets or Web Start your applications will work in the same way as with the Oracle JDK.\r\n 6. If you want to move to JDK 11 (the current long-term support release, as defined by Oracle but followed by all other JDK providers), then you will need to choose one of the free distributions (like Zulu Community).\r\n\r\nIt is highly recommended to ensure your JDK is up to date and contains all relevant security patches.  Continuing to use an older version could expose you to significant security exploits.","title":"Which free version of Java can I use for production environments and or commercial purposes?","body":"<p>Oracle made a number of significant changes to how the Java platform is developed, distributed and updated at the same time as the launch of JDK 9.</p>\n\n<p>The key facts to answer your questions are these:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Oracle was using the Oracle Binary Code License (OBCL) for Java.

This should then segue into why an actual useful LinkedList is a bit tricky to implement, API-wise.\r\n\r\n&gt; Using a linked list has better insertion and deletion time for some cases with large data sets.\r\n\r\nNo it doesn&#39;t, except in very very exotic circumstances. Let&#39;s get to it.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say you have a list with 50 elements inside it, and you want to add something right in the middle. For arraylists, this means the system has to &#39;move&#39; 25 elements up a slot so that there&#39;s &#39;room&#39;, and it gets a little worse if the backing array is exactly at capacity (in which case we have to create a new array, copy the original to this newly created one in two chunks and then set the new value at the right index). But at least the system knows _where_ to cut.\r\n\r\nNow lets look at Linked Lists. In theory, it&#39;s an O(1) operation: Create a new tracker object, set its &#39;prev&#39; to the 24th element, its &#39;next&#39; to the 25th element, then update the tracker of the 24th element to have its &#39;next&#39; point to the new tracker, and update the tracker of what was the 25th element so that its &#39;prev&#39; points to the new tracker. Done. This algorithm works even if the list has a few bazillion entries in it. O(1). Right?\r\n\r\nNo. The problem is, how do you __get__ there?\r\n\r\n`list.add(25, newItem)` cannot magically skip around LinkedList&#39;s nearly fatal downside, which is: __It has to iterate through 25 elements just to get to the right tracker in the first place__. In other words, __LinkedList&#39;s `.add(idx, newItem)` method is just as O(n) as ArrayList&#39;s is!__\r\n\r\nIf you leave O(n) land behind and get to pragmatics one might say that LinkedList has excellent performance when you add near the &#39;start&#39; of the list, whereas ArrayList would be at its worst there (LinkedList needs to iterate only a few trackers to get to the right one, whereas ArrayList needs to move a gigantic chunk), but you don&#39;t want to do that - when we leave theoretic performance models (that is, O(n) notation) behind and get to actual performance, LinkedList&#39;s is truly _deplorable_ - just about everything that isn&#39;t algorithmic that could go wrong, does go wrong with LinkedList.\r\n\r\nLinkedList&#39;s &#39;fast at the start&#39; grows to perfection once we talk about &#39;add at the beginning&#39;, with a guaranteed O(1) behaviour. However, this is kinda fake - you can trivially get the same performance out of an arraylist, simply wrap it into a thing that reverses all operations (`.get(x)` is implemented as `.get(size() - 1 - x)`, for example), because ArrayList is O(1) for insertion at the end. So that&#39;s not much of a bonus there. Mostly, just use ArrayDeque, which has fantastic performance for add-near-start and just as great for add-near-end.\r\n\r\nAbout those pragmatics:\r\n\r\nLinkedList needs a tracker object: An extra object which has 3 fields:\r\n\r\n* `value`: The actual value at this position in the linked list\r\n* `prev`: The tracker object for the item before us in this list (because LinkedList is two-way traversable; if you don&#39;t need two-way, you can leave this one out). It&#39;s `null` for the first element.\r\n* `next`: The tracker object for the item after us in this list - it&#39;s `null` for the last.\r\n\r\nFinally the list itself is simply 2 fields: `start` and `end`, with start pointing at the tracker of the first object and `end` at the tracker of the last. With an empty linkedlist having `null` values.\r\n\r\nThose tracker objects are __expensive__.\r\n\r\nModern CPUs cannot access memory. At all. They can only access an on-die cache which comes in an entire page. The only operation that the CPU can send to the memory controller is &#39;flush this ENTIRE page to main memory&#39; (it cannot flush half of a page; a page size depends on your CPU, but think 64k or so), and &#39;replace this on-die cache by loading in this ENTIRE page from main memory&#39;. And both of these operations take 500 or more CPU cycles - so the CPU is really gonna do quite the thumb twiddling whilst the slow-as-molasses memory controller does its work. That main memory bank is quite a few lightnanoseconds away from the CPU, that alone makes it slow as molasses!\r\n\r\nHence, when you are talking about a smallish arraylist, given that the JVM guarantees that arrays are &#39;contiguous in memory&#39;, as long as the entire list fits in a single page, then __effectively all operations on it are instantaneous__, and that whole `O(n)` thing sounds nice but, it&#39;s just entirely pointless, really.\r\n\r\nAs they say, In theory, the practice is just like the theory. But in practice.... it usually is nowhere near.\r\n\r\nLinkedList goes in the opposite direction - the nature of modern CPU design (&#39;modern&#39; in quotes here - on-die cache pages and no actual direct memory access by a CPU is at this point over a decade old) actually is bad news: Those extra trackers have a nasty tendency to __not be contiguous__, meaning a full traversal of a linked list causes a load of cache misses, and each cache miss comes with a free 500+ CPU cycles worth of thumb twiddling. OUCH.\r\n\r\n## So how do I squeeze O(1) performance out of this thing??\r\n\r\nIn java? The only way is to use `.listIterator()`, or `.iterator().remove()`. __The only way to get O(1) performance out of a LinkedList where ArrayList has O(n), is via those!__\r\n\r\nYou can use the ListIterator to iterate your way to the right position (this will be `O(n)`, if you want to add in the middle), but from there you can add as much as you like, and each `.add` operation is indeed O(1), though the trackers you&#39;re making are likely in a different cache page, so you&#39;re negatively impacting any future performance of this list.\r\n\r\n## That sucks. Is there a better way?\r\n\r\nThere surely is! Imaginea linkedlist of Strings. But now imagine that java&#39;s own `String` class has 2 more fields than you&#39;re used to: `String next;` and `String prev;`, with next and prev pointing at the next/previous string in the list. Now you can just &#39;add a new thing between this string and the next string in the list please&#39;, from any string, by simply updating `.next.prev`, and then `.next`, to point at the new string (and, of course, assigning the next and prev fields in the new string with the right values). Now it doesn&#39;t matter how you got to any item in the list, once you have it, obtained however, you can do O(1) ops on the list. And we even get to &#39;save&#39; on trackers - we don&#39;t need em (fields themselves within a single object are guaranteed contiguous, though note that all non-primitive fields are, of course, pointers, and the thing they&#39;re pointing at might not be).\r\n\r\nBut java doesn&#39;t work that way.\r\n\r\nSome languages make it easy to make an ersatz &#39;combi-type&#39; that acts in memory as a single new type (i.e. guarantees contiguousness of the combination of some type and some additions to the type), this is often called &#39;mixins&#39;. With that power, you can make your own linked lists, and you wouldn&#39;t even have any type named `LinkedList` - some type just &#39;grows&#39; next and prev variables on command.\r\n\r\njava just isn&#39;t like that. Javascript can be - objects really are just hashmaps and you&#39;re free to introduce a prev and next pointer if you want. To do this, you don&#39;t need any built-in types of any sort, you just need a tutorial, really.\r\n\r\n## Still, it&#39;d have been nice\r\n\r\nActually javascript has almost no batteries included. Famously, something as crazy simplistic as left-padding a string needs a [rather notorious library](https://qz.com/646467/how-one-programmer-broke-the-internet-by-deleting-a-tiny-piece-of-code/).\r\n\r\nSo, more generally, the answer to &#39;why does javascript not have X baked in&#39; is a very generally applicable: &#39;Because javascript just doesnt have much baked in at all&#39;.\r\n\r\n## I don&#39;t believe you - I am a card carrying member of the church of `O(n)`!\r\n\r\nWell, some skepticism is quite healthy as a programmer, so good for you!\r\n\r\nYou should write some code to test your preconceptions. And to test my theories while you&#39;re at it!\r\n\r\nMake code that e.g. inserts in the middle using `list.set(list.size() / 2, newElem)` and time it for both when `list` is an instance of ArrayList as well as for an instance of LinkedList. Make sure you use a framework to knows how to properly do this, because between hotspot compilation, JVM warming, optimizations to skip code that doesn&#39;t produce any results that are used entirely, modern CPU design, and the fact that modern OSes aren&#39;t realtime, it&#39;s really hard to do that. Hence, use [Java Microbenchmark Harness](https://www.baeldung.com/java-microbenchmark-harness) to run these tests.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll find that it is quite difficult to create a scenario where LinkedList significantly outperforms ArrayList, and quite easy for the reverse. Even in cases where basic big-O notation would suggest otherwise.\r\n\r\n## So what should I use instead?\r\n\r\nThere are certainly scenarios where ArrayList&#39;s performance characteristics are no good. However, for just about every imaginable scenario where that&#39;s true, LinkedList is not the best, or even a good answer as an alternative. Instead, look at `ArrayDeque`, or rewrite the algorithm to use `TreeMap` or `HashMap`, use databases, skiplists, primitive lists (as you can have really quite sizable primitive lists and still get fantastic performance), or enumsets.\r\n\r\nMost of which do not have javascript equivalents either, but all of which have third party libraries in the node ecosystem that do. Of course, if you do that, you may eventually run into that whole padLeft debacle thing, but then you&#39;re kinda signing up for that the moment you decide to use javascript in the first place.\r\n","title":"Why is there not an implementation of a linked list in JavaScript?","body":"<p>To explain this, lets explain why java's <code>LinkedList</code> is almost entirely useless. This should then segue into why an actual useful LinkedList is a bit tricky to implement, API-wise.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Using a linked list has better insertion and deletion time for some cases with large data sets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No it doesn't, except in very very exotic circumstances. Let's get to it.</p>\n<p>Let's say you have a list with 50 elements inside it, and you want to add something right in the middle. For arraylists, this means the system has to 'move' 25 elements up a slot so that there's 'room', and it gets a little worse if the backing array is exactly at capacity (in which case we have to create a new array, copy the original to this newly created one in two chunks and then set the new value at the right index). But at least the system knows <em>where</em> to cut.</p>\n<p>Now lets look at Linked Lists. In theory, it's an O(1) operation: Create a new tracker object, set its 'prev' to the 24th element, its 'next' to the 25th element, then update the tracker of the 24th element to have its 'next' point to the new tracker, and update the tracker of what was the 25th element so that its 'prev' points to the new tracker. Done. This algorithm works even if the list has a few bazillion entries in it. O(1). Right?</p>\n<p>No. The problem is, how do you <strong>get</strong> there?</p>\n<p><code>list.add(25, newItem)</code> cannot magically skip around LinkedList's nearly fatal downside, which is: <strong>It has to iterate through 25 elements just to get to the right tracker in the first place</strong>. In other words, <strong>LinkedList's <code>.add(idx, newItem)</code> method is just as O(n) as ArrayList's is!</strong></p>\n<p>If you leave O(n) land behind and get to pragmatics one might say that LinkedList has excellent performance when you add near the 'start' of the list, whereas ArrayList would be at its worst there (LinkedList needs to iterate only a few trackers to get to the right one, whereas ArrayList needs to move a gigantic chunk), but you don't want to do that - when we leave theoretic performance models (that is, O(n) notation) behind and get to actual performance, LinkedList's is truly <em>deplorable</em> - just about everything that isn't algorithmic that could go wrong, does go wrong with LinkedList.</p>\n<p>LinkedList's 'fast at the start' grows to perfection once we talk about 'add at the beginning', with a guaranteed O(1) behaviour. However, this is kinda fake - you can trivially get the same performance out of an arraylist, simply wrap it into a thing that reverses all operations (<code>.get(x)</code> is implemented as <code>.get(size() - 1 - x)</code>, for example), because ArrayList is O(1) for insertion at the end. So that's not much of a bonus there. Mostly, just use ArrayDeque, which has fantastic performance for add-near-start and just as great for add-near-end.</p>\n<p>About those pragmatics:</p>\n<p>LinkedList needs a tracker object: An extra object which has 3 fields:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>value</code>: The actual value at this position in the linked list</li>\n<li><code>prev</code>: The tracker object for the item before us in this list (because LinkedList is two-way traversable; if you don't need two-way, you can leave this one out). It's <code>null</code> for the first element.</li>\n<li><code>next</code>: The tracker object for the item after us in this list - it's <code>null</code> for the last.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally the list itself is simply 2 fields: <code>start</code> and <code>end</code>, with start pointing at the tracker of the first object and <code>end</code> at the tracker of the last.

I would really appreciate if anyone can help me with this ONLY USING MOCKITO and not PowerMock etc.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","javafx","text-to-speech"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1180113,"reputation":152335,"user_id":1155209,"display_name":"jewelsea"},"score":3,"creation_date":1700047342,"post_id":77486491,"comment_id":136606138,"body_markdown":"You are using Maven.

Use a [JDBC driver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDBC_driver) compliant with [JDBC 4.2](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/170) or later. No need for strings, no need for `java.sql.*` classes.\r\n\r\nWhere to obtain the java.time classes? \r\n\r\n - [**Java SE 8**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_8), [**Java SE 9**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_9), [**Java SE 10**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_10), [**Java SE 11**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_11), and later  - Part of the standard Java API with a bundled implementation.\r\n  - Java 9 adds some minor features and fixes.\r\n - [**Java SE 6**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_6) and [**Java SE 7**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_7)\r\n  - Most of the *java.time* functionality is back-ported to Java 6 &amp; 7 in [***ThreeTen-Backport***](http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/).\r\n - [**Android**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system))\r\n  - Later versions of Android bundle implementations of the *java.time* classes.\r\n  - For earlier Android (&lt;26), the [***ThreeTenABP***](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP) project adapts [***ThreeTen-Backport***](http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/) (mentioned above).

In such cases no source elements will be traversed and no intermediate operations will be evaluated. Behavioral parameters with side-effects, which are strongly discouraged except for harmless cases such as debugging, may be affected. For example, consider the following stream:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;      List&lt;String&gt; l = Arrays.asList(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;);\r\n&gt;      long count = l.stream().peek(System.out::println).count();\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The number of elements covered by the stream source, a `List`, is known and the intermediate operation, peek, does not inject into or remove elements from the stream (as may be the case for flatMap or filter operations). Thus the count is the size of the `List` and there is no need to execute the pipeline and, as a side-effect, print out the list elements.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIf you want to make sure that the intermediate operations are executed you can add a dummy filter operation:\r\n\r\n        long result = lst.stream()\r\n                .peek(System.out::println)\r\n                .map(x -&gt; { System.out.println(&quot;In the middle&quot;); return x+&quot;3&quot;; })\r\n                .peek(System.out::println)\r\n                .filter(x -&gt; true)\r\n                .count();\r\n        System.out.println(result);\r\n\r\n---\r\n_How are streams processed_?\r\n\r\nIts the terminal operation that triggers processing of the stream.\r\n\r\nA `collect()` operation asks the preceeding step (`peek()`) for an element. The `peek()` step in turn asks its preceeding step (`map()`) for an element. The `map()` step asks its preceeding step (the first `peek()`) for an element. The first `peek()` step asks the source (the `List`) for an element. This element is then passed back through the various step until it arrives at the `collect()` operation.

When the border pane lays out its child nodes, it will set these values to position the circle as it needs.

The `submit(...)` method is thread-safe.  While doing it inside a synchronized block (if done properly: see next point!) ensures that the jobs are submitted in groups of 10, nothing prevents some of the tasks in the starting while the group is still being submitted.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you are synchronizing on a `SheepManager` instance that is thread-confined.  That means that the synchronization will be ineffective!
