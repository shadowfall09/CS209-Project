I suggest the incendiary article by Allen Holub &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2003/jw-0905-toolbox.html&quot;&gt;Getters And Setters Are Evil&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. Granted, the title is for shock value, but the author makes valid points.\r\n\r\nEssentially, if you have `getters` and `setters` for each and every private field, you are making those fields as good as public. You&#39;d be very hard-pressed to change the type of a private field without ripple effects to every class that calls that `getter`.\r\n\r\nMoreover, from a strictly OO point of view, objects should be responding to messages (methods) that correspond to their (hopefully) single responsibility.

The first category is based on multiplicity and it includes three types:\r\n\r\n    *One-to-one relationships.

Also known as a many-to-one relationship, this occurs when the maximum of one multiplicity is one and the other is greater than one.  An example is the works in relationship between Employee and Division.  An employee works in one division and any given division has one or more employees working in it.\r\n    *Many-to-many relationships.

comments = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    \r\n        //Constructors, getters and setters removed for brevity\r\n    \r\n        public void addComment(PostComment comment) {\r\n            comments.add(comment);\r\n            comment.setPost(this);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void removeComment(PostComment comment) {\r\n            comments.remove(comment);\r\n            comment.setPost(null);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe parent `Post` entity features two utility methods (e.g. `addComment` and `removeComment`) which are used to synchronize both sides of the bidirectional association. \r\n\r\nYou should provide these methods whenever you are working with a bidirectional association as, otherwise, you risk [very subtle state propagation issues](https://vladmihalcea.com/jpa-hibernate-synchronize-bidirectional-entity-associations/).\r\n\r\nThe unidirectional `@OneToMany` association is to be avoided as it&#39;s less efficient than using `@ManyToOne` or the bidirectional `@OneToMany` association.\r\n\r\nOne-to-one\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe one-to-one table relationship looks as follows:\r\n\r\n[![One-to-one][2]](https://vladmihalcea.com/the-best-way-to-map-a-onetoone-relationship-with-jpa-and-hibernate/)\r\n\r\nIn a relational database system, a one-to-one table relationship links two tables based on a `Primary Key` column in the child which is also a `Foreign Key` referencing the `Primary Key` of the parent table row.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we can say that the child table shares the `Primary Key` with the parent table.\r\n\r\nIn the table diagram above, the `id` column in the `post_details` table has also a `Foreign Key` relationship with the `post` table `id` `Primary Key` column:\r\n```sql\r\n    ALTER TABLE\r\n        post_details\r\n    ADD CONSTRAINT\r\n        fk_post_details_id\r\n    FOREIGN KEY (id) REFERENCES post\r\n```\r\n## Using the JPA `@OneToOne` with `@MapsId` annotations\r\n\r\nThe best way to map a `@OneToOne` relationship is to use `@MapsId`. This way, you don&#39;t even need a bidirectional association since you can always fetch the `PostDetails` entity by using the `Post` entity identifier.\r\n\r\nThe mapping looks like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Entity(name = &quot;PostDetails&quot;)\r\n@Table(name = &quot;post_details&quot;)\r\npublic class PostDetails {\r\n\r\n    @Id\r\n    private Long id;\r\n\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;created_on&quot;)\r\n    private Date createdOn;\r\n\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;created_by&quot;)\r\n    private String createdBy;\r\n\r\n    @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\r\n    @MapsId\r\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;id&quot;)\r\n    private Post post;\r\n\r\n    public PostDetails() {}\r\n\r\n    public PostDetails(String createdBy) {\r\n        createdOn = new Date();\r\n        this.createdBy = createdBy;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    //Getters and setters omitted for brevity\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, the `id` property serves as both Primary Key and Foreign Key. You&#39;ll notice that the `@Id` column no longer uses a `@GeneratedValue` annotation since the identifier is populated with the identifier of the `post` association.\r\n\r\nMany-to-many\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe many-to-many table relationship looks as follows:\r\n\r\n[![Many-to-many][3]](https://vladmihalcea.com/the-best-way-to-use-the-manytomany-annotation-with-jpa-and-hibernate/)\r\n\r\nIn a relational database system, a many-to-many table relationship links two parent tables via a child table which contains two `Foreign Key` columns referencing the `Primary Key` columns of the two parent tables.\r\n\r\nIn the table diagram above, the `post_id` column in the `post_tag` table has also a `Foreign Key` relationship with the `post` table id `Primary Key` column:\r\n```sql\r\n    ALTER TABLE\r\n        post_tag\r\n    ADD CONSTRAINT\r\n        fk_post_tag_post_id\r\n    FOREIGN KEY (post_id) REFERENCES post\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, the `tag_id` column in the `post_tag` table has a `Foreign Key` relationship with the `tag` table id `Primary Key` column:\r\n```sql\r\n    ALTER TABLE\r\n        post_tag\r\n    ADD CONSTRAINT\r\n        fk_post_tag_tag_id\r\n    FOREIGN KEY (tag_id) REFERENCES tag\r\n```\r\n## Using the JPA `@ManyToMany` mapping\r\n\r\nThis is how you can map the `many-to-many` table relationship with JPA and Hibernate:\r\n```java\r\n    @Entity(name = &quot;Post&quot;)\r\n    @Table(name = &quot;post&quot;)\r\n    public class Post {\r\n\r\n        @Id\r\n        @GeneratedValue\r\n        private Long id;\r\n\r\n        private String title;\r\n\r\n        @ManyToMany(cascade = { \r\n            CascadeType.PERSIST, \r\n            CascadeType.MERGE\r\n        })\r\n        @JoinTable(name = &quot;post_tag&quot;,\r\n            joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = &quot;post_id&quot;),\r\n            inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = &quot;tag_id&quot;)\r\n        )\r\n        private Set&lt;Tag&gt; tags = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n        //Getters and setters ommitted for brevity\r\n\r\n        public void addTag(Tag tag) {\r\n            tags.add(tag);\r\n            tag.getPosts().add(this);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void removeTag(Tag tag) {\r\n            tags.remove(tag);\r\n            tag.getPosts().remove(this);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public boolean equals(Object o) {\r\n            if (this == o) return true;\r\n            if (!(o instanceof Post)) return false;\r\n            return id != null &amp;&amp; id.equals(((Post) o).getId());\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public int hashCode() {\r\n            return getClass().hashCode();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Entity(name = &quot;Tag&quot;)\r\n    @Table(name = &quot;tag&quot;)\r\n    public class Tag {\r\n\r\n        @Id\r\n        @GeneratedValue\r\n        private Long id;\r\n\r\n        @NaturalId\r\n        private String name;\r\n\r\n        @ManyToMany(mappedBy = &quot;tags&quot;)\r\n        private Set&lt;Post&gt; posts = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n        //Getters and setters ommitted for brevity\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public boolean equals(Object o) {\r\n            if (this == o) return true;\r\n            if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;\r\n            Tag tag = (Tag) o;\r\n            return Objects.equals(name, tag.name);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public int hashCode() {\r\n            return Objects.hash(name);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. The `tags` association in the `Post` entity only defines the `PERSIST` and `MERGE` cascade types. The `REMOVE` entity state transition doesn&#39;t make any sense for a `@ManyToMany` JPA association since it could trigger a chain deletion that would ultimately wipe both sides of the association.\r\n2. The add/remove utility methods are mandatory if you use bidirectional associations so that you can make sure that both sides of the association are in sync.\r\n3. The `Post` entity uses the entity identifier for equality since it lacks any unique business key. You can use the entity identifier for equality as long as you make sure that it stays consistent across all entity state transitions.\r\n4. The `Tag` entity has a unique business key which is marked with the Hibernate-specific `@NaturalId` annotation. When that&#39;s the case, the unique business key is [the best candidate for equality checks](https://vladmihalcea.com/hibernate-facts-equals-and-hashcode/).\r\n5. The `mappedBy` attribute of the `posts` association in the `Tag` entity marks that, in this bidirectional relationship, the `Post` entity owns the association. This is needed since only one side can own a relationship, and changes are only propagated to the database from this particular side.\r\n6. The `Set` is to be preferred, as using a `List` with `@ManyToMany` is less efficient.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gxitd.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/WOocn.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/2tXIa.png","title":"Difference Between One-to-Many, Many-to-One and Many-to-Many?","body":"<h2>One-to-many</h2>\n<p>The one-to-many table relationship looks like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vladmihalcea.com/the-best-way-to-map-a-onetomany-association-with-jpa-and-hibernate/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gxitd.png\" alt=\"One-to-many\" /></a></p>\n<p>In a relational database system, a one-to-many table relationship associates two tables based on a <code>Foreign Key</code> column in the child table referencing the <code>Primary Key</code> of one record in the parent table.</p>\n<p>In the table diagram above, the <code>post_id</code> column in the <code>post_comment</code> table has a <code>Foreign Key</code> relationship with the <code>post</code> table id <code>Primary Key</code> column:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-sql prettyprint-override\"><code>    ALTER TABLE\n        post_comment\n    ADD CONSTRAINT\n        fk_post_comment_post_id\n    FOREIGN KEY (post_id) REFERENCES post\n</code></pre>\n<h2>@ManyToOne annotation</h2>\n<p>In JPA, the best way to map the one-to-many table relationship is to use the <code>@ManyToOne</code> annotation.</p>\n<p>In our case, the <code>PostComment</code> child entity  maps the <code>post_id</code> Foreign Key column using the <code>@ManyToOne</code> annotation:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>    @Entity(name = &quot;PostComment&quot;)\n    @Table(name = &quot;post_comment&quot;)\n    public class PostComment {\n    \n        @Id\n        @GeneratedValue\n        private Long id;\n    \n        private String review;\n    \n        @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\n        private Post post;\n        \n    }\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Using the JPA <code>@OneToMany</code> annotation</h2>\n<p>Just because you have the option of using the <code>@OneToMany</code> annotation, it doesn't mean it should be the default option for all the <em>one-to-many</em> database relationships.</p>\n<p>The problem with JPA collections is that we can only use them when their element count is rather low.</p>\n<p>The best way to map a <code>@OneToMany</code> association is to rely on the <code>@ManyToOne</code> side to propagate all entity state changes:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>    @Entity(name = &quot;Post&quot;)\n    @Table(name = &quot;post&quot;)\n    public class Post {\n    \n        @Id\n        @GeneratedValue\n        private Long id;\n    \n        private String title;\n    \n        @OneToMany(\n            mappedBy = &quot;post&quot;, \n            cascade = CascadeType.ALL, \n            orphanRemoval = true\n        )\n        private List&lt;PostComment&gt;

I have tried to get IMS/CICS messages to work with JMS but have failed. A JMS message is internally known as an MQRFH2 header.\r\n\r\nMQRFH2 and MQCIH headers are called embedded headers. Meaning they exist in front of the message payload and not in a separate structure. So, basically, you are chaining together several embedded headers.\r\n\r\n    {MQRFH2}{MQCIH}{message payload}\r\n\r\nFirst, you have to set the &quot;format&quot; field of each chained embedded message. MQ/JMS library will set the correct format for the JMS message. But you need to set the format of the MQCIH in the MQRFH2 header. i.e. So MQ knows what to expect in the next part of the chain. And in the MQCIH, you need to set the format of the message payload. i.e. NONE, STRING, etc..\r\n\r\ni.e. something like this.\r\n\r\n    outData.setStringProperty(WMQConstants.JMS_IBM_MQMD_FORMAT, &quot;MQCICS&quot;);\r\n    outData.setStringProperty(WMQConstants.JMS_IBM_MQMD_Encoding, MQC.MQENC_INTEGER_NORMAL);\r\n    outData.setStringProperty(WMQConstants.JMS_IBM_MQMD_CodedCharSetId, 819);\r\n\r\nOr possibly this:\r\n\r\n    outData.setStringProperty(&quot;JMS_IBM_Format&quot;, &quot;MQCICS&quot;);\r\n    outData.setIntProperty(&quot;JMS_IBM_Encoding&quot;, MQC.MQENC_INTEGER_NORMAL);\r\n    outData.setIntProperty(&quot;JMS_IBM_Character_Set&quot;, 819);\r\n\r\nThen, you create the MQCIH header:\r\n\r\n    //write MQCIH struct into message buffer\r\n    \r\n    outData.writeString(&quot;CIH &quot;);           /* Structure identifier */\r\n    outData.writeInt(1);                   /* Structure version number 1 or 2 */\r\n    outData.writeInt(164);                 /* Length of MQCIH structure V1=164 V2=180 */\r\n    outData.writeInt(putMsg.encoding);     /* Reserved */\r\n    outData.writeInt(putMsg.characterSet); /* Reserved */\r\n    outData.writeString(MQC.MQFMT_NONE);   /* MQ Format name */\r\n    outData.writeInt(0);                   /* Reserved */\r\n    outData.writeInt(0);                   /* Return code from bridge */\r\n    outData.writeInt(0);                   /* MQ completion code or CICS\r\n                                                  EIBRESP */\r\n    outData.writeInt(0);                   /* MQ reason or feedback code, or CICS\r\n                                                  EIBRESP2 */\r\n    outData.writeInt(273);                 /* Unit-of-work control */\r\n    outData.writeInt(-2);                  /* Wait interval for MQGET call issued\r\n                                                  by bridge */\r\n    outData.writeInt(1);                   /* Link type */\r\n    outData.writeInt(-1);                  /* Output commarea data length */\r\n    outData.writeInt(0);                   /* Bridge facility release time */\r\n    outData.writeInt(0);                   /* Send/receive ADS descriptor */\r\n    outData.writeInt(0);                   /* Whether task can be\r\n                                                  conversational */\r\n    outData.writeInt(0);                   /* Status at end of task */\r\n    //     byte [] temp = new byte[8];\r\n    //outData.writeFully(temp);               /* BVT token value */\r\n    outData.writeInt(0);   // need 8 use 4 * 2\r\n    outData.writeInt(0);\r\n    \r\n    outData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* MQ call name or CICS EIBFN function\r\n                                                  name */\r\n    outData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* Abend code */\r\n    outData.writeString(&quot;Password&quot;);       /* Password or passticket */\r\n    outData.writeString(&quot;        &quot;);       /* Reserved */\r\n    //   putMsg.writeString(MQC.MQFMT_NONE);   /* MQ format name of reply message */\r\n    outData.writeString(&quot;ABCD1234&quot;);   /* MQ format name of reply message */\r\n    outData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* Remote sysid to use */\r\n    outData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* Remote transid to attach */\r\n    outData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* Transaction to attach */\r\n    outData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* Terminal emulated attributes */\r\n    outData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* AID key */\r\n    outData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* Transaction start code */\r\n    outData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* Abend transaction code */\r\n    outData.writeString(&quot;MMMM&quot;);           /* Next transaction to attach */\r\n    outData.writeString(&quot;        &quot;);       /* Reserved */\r\n    outData.writeString(&quot;        &quot;);       /* Reserved */\r\n    \r\n         //Version 2 fields\r\n    outData.writeInt(0);                   /* Cursor position */\r\n    outData.writeInt(0);                   /* Error offset */\r\n    outData.writeInt(0);                   /* Input item */\r\n    outData.writeInt(0);                   /* Reserved */\r\n\r\nFinally, you can go down this path but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it unless you are extremely knowledgeable of MQ.

I have tried to get IMS/CICS messages to work with JMS but have failed. A JMS message is internally known as an MQRFH2 header.</p>\n<p>MQRFH2 and MQCIH headers are called embedded headers. Meaning they exist in front of the message payload and not in a separate structure. So, basically, you are chaining together several embedded headers.</p>\n<pre><code>{MQRFH2}{MQCIH}{message payload}\n</code></pre>\n<p>First, you have to set the &quot;format&quot; field of each chained embedded message. MQ/JMS library will set the correct format for the JMS message. But you need to set the format of the MQCIH in the MQRFH2 header. i.e. So MQ knows what to expect in the next part of the chain. And in the MQCIH, you need to set the format of the message payload. i.e. NONE, STRING, etc..</p>\n<p>i.e. something like this.</p>\n<pre><code>outData.setStringProperty(WMQConstants.JMS_IBM_MQMD_FORMAT, &quot;MQCICS&quot;);\noutData.setStringProperty(WMQConstants.JMS_IBM_MQMD_Encoding, MQC.MQENC_INTEGER_NORMAL);\noutData.setStringProperty(WMQConstants.JMS_IBM_MQMD_CodedCharSetId, 819);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or possibly this:</p>\n<pre><code>outData.setStringProperty(&quot;JMS_IBM_Format&quot;, &quot;MQCICS&quot;);\noutData.setIntProperty(&quot;JMS_IBM_Encoding&quot;, MQC.MQENC_INTEGER_NORMAL);\noutData.setIntProperty(&quot;JMS_IBM_Character_Set&quot;, 819);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, you create the MQCIH header:</p>\n<pre><code>//write MQCIH struct into message buffer\n\noutData.writeString(&quot;CIH &quot;);           /* Structure identifier */\noutData.writeInt(1);                   /* Structure version number 1 or 2 */\noutData.writeInt(164);                 /* Length of MQCIH structure V1=164 V2=180 */\noutData.writeInt(putMsg.encoding);     /* Reserved */\noutData.writeInt(putMsg.characterSet); /* Reserved */\noutData.writeString(MQC.MQFMT_NONE);   /* MQ Format name */\noutData.writeInt(0);                   /* Reserved */\noutData.writeInt(0);                   /* Return code from bridge */\noutData.writeInt(0);                   /* MQ completion code or CICS\n                                              EIBRESP */\noutData.writeInt(0);                   /* MQ reason or feedback code, or CICS\n                                              EIBRESP2 */\noutData.writeInt(273);                 /* Unit-of-work control */\noutData.writeInt(-2);                  /* Wait interval for MQGET call issued\n                                              by bridge */\noutData.writeInt(1);                   /* Link type */\noutData.writeInt(-1);                  /* Output commarea data length */\noutData.writeInt(0);                   /* Bridge facility release time */\noutData.writeInt(0);                   /* Send/receive ADS descriptor */\noutData.writeInt(0);                   /* Whether task can be\n                                              conversational */\noutData.writeInt(0);                   /* Status at end of task */\n//     byte [] temp = new byte[8];\n//outData.writeFully(temp);               /* BVT token value */\noutData.writeInt(0);   // need 8 use 4 * 2\noutData.writeInt(0);\n\noutData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* MQ call name or CICS EIBFN function\n                                              name */\noutData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* Abend code */\noutData.writeString(&quot;Password&quot;);       /* Password or passticket */\noutData.writeString(&quot;        &quot;);       /* Reserved */\n//   putMsg.writeString(MQC.MQFMT_NONE);   /* MQ format name of reply message */\noutData.writeString(&quot;ABCD1234&quot;);   /* MQ format name of reply message */\noutData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* Remote sysid to use */\noutData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* Remote transid to attach */\noutData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* Transaction to attach */\noutData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* Terminal emulated attributes */\noutData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* AID key */\noutData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* Transaction start code */\noutData.writeString(&quot;    &quot;);           /* Abend transaction code */\noutData.writeString(&quot;MMMM&quot;);           /* Next transaction to attach */\noutData.writeString(&quot;        &quot;);       /* Reserved */\noutData.writeString(&quot;        &quot;);       /* Reserved */\n\n     //Version 2 fields\noutData.writeInt(0);                   /* Cursor position */\noutData.writeInt(0);                   /* Error offset */\noutData.writeInt(0);                   /* Input item */\noutData.writeInt(0);                   /* Reserved */\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally, you can go down this path but I wouldn't recommend it unless you are extremely knowledgeable of MQ.

This is not possible, because that type is an interface and interfaces cannot be instantiated. You would have to use a concrete implementation, such as [`ArrayList`][4].\r\n\r\nThis problem is where your current error is coming from:\r\n\r\n&gt; ```none\r\n&gt; Caused by: java.lang.InstantiationException: java.util.List\r\n&gt;         at java.lang.Class.newInstance(Unknown Source)\r\n&gt;         at sun.reflect.misc.ReflectUtil.newInstance(Unknown Source)\r\n&gt;         at javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader$InstanceDeclarationElement.constructValue(FXMLLoader.java:1009)\r\n&gt;         ... 15 more\r\n&gt; Caused by: java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: java.util.List.&lt;init&gt;()\r\n&gt;         at java.lang.Class.getConstructor0(Unknown Source)\r\n&gt; ```\r\n\r\n## Incorrect Reference\r\n\r\nYou are referencing the list incorrectly. Because the list is from the controller, it should look like:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;fx:reference source=&quot;controller.list&quot;/&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it will still complain about that value not existing. The `FXMLLoader` does not do field access when trying to _get_ a value. It looks for an appropriate getter method instead. For instance, here we&#39;re telling the loader to get the `list` property of the controller instance, and so it looks for a `getList()` method in the controller class. So, that method needs to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic List&lt;Label&gt; getList() {\r\n    return list;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Adding List to &quot;Read-Only List Property&quot;\r\n\r\n_**Warning:** This problem would seem to make your approach impractical, if not impossible._\r\n\r\nYou are trying to populate the `children` list of the `VBox`. That list is known as a [&quot;read-only list property&quot;][1]. Unfortunately, the linked documentation says nothing about being able to add a _collection_ to such properties (e.g., via `addAll`):\r\n\r\n&gt; A read-only list property is a Bean property whose getter returns an instance of `java.util.List` and has no corresponding setter method. The contents of a read-only list element are automatically added to the list as they are processed.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;For example, the &quot;children&quot; property of `javafx.scene.Group` is a read-only list property representing the group&#39;s child nodes:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; ```xml\r\n&gt; &lt;?import javafx.scene.*?&gt;\r\n&gt; &lt;?import javafx.scene.shape.*?&gt;\r\n&gt; &lt;Group xmlns:fx=&quot;http://javafx.com/fxml&quot;&gt;\r\n&gt;     &lt;children&gt;\r\n&gt;         &lt;Rectangle fx:id=&quot;rectangle&quot; x=&quot;10&quot; y=&quot;10&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot;\r\n&gt;             fill=&quot;#ff0000&quot;/&gt;\r\n&gt;         ...\r\n&gt;     &lt;/children&gt;\r\n&gt; &lt;/Group&gt;\r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; As each sub-element of the `&lt;children&gt;` element is read, it is added to the list returned by `Group#getChildren()`.\r\n\r\nAnd trying it out, you get an error like the following:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unable to coerce [[Label@15af0be5[styleClass=label]&#39;Foo&#39;, Label@49a4edc6[styleClass=label]&#39;Bar&#39;]] to class javafx.scene.Node.\r\n        at javafx.fxml/com.sun.javafx.fxml.BeanAdapter.coerce(BeanAdapter.java:497)\r\n        at javafx.fxml/javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader$Element.add(FXMLLoader.java:174)\r\n        at javafx.fxml/javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader$ValueElement.processEndElement(FXMLLoader.java:801)\r\n        at javafx.fxml/javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader.processEndElement(FXMLLoader.java:2969)\r\n        at javafx.fxml/javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader.loadImpl(FXMLLoader.java:2654)\r\n        ... 17 more\r\n```\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;(i.e., it could not cast `List&lt;Node&gt;` to `Node`)&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# A Solution\r\n\r\nIf you want to keep the list of labels defined in your controller, then you can simply add those labels to the `VBox` in the `initialize` method.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage list;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\nimport javafx.fxml.FXML;\r\nimport javafx.scene.control.Label;\r\nimport javafx.scene.layout.VBox;\r\n\r\npublic class ListController {\r\n\r\n    private final List&lt;Label&gt; list = List.of(new Label(&quot;Foo&quot;), new Label(&quot;Bar&quot;));\r\n\r\n    @FXML\r\n    private VBox box;\r\n\r\n    @FXML\r\n    private void initialize() {\r\n        box.getChildren().addAll(list);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis of course requires adding an appropriate `fx:id` attribute in the FXML file.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;?import javafx.scene.layout.VBox?&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;VBox fx:id=&quot;box&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://javafx.com/javafx&quot; xmlns:fx=&quot;http://javafx.com/fxml&quot; \r\n      fx:controller=&quot;list.ListController&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;/VBox&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `List::of` returns an unmodifiable list. Modifying this list would not make much sense anyway, at least not after adding the elements to the `VBox`&#39;s children list, as modifying it would _not_ implicitly modify the children list. If labels can be added and removed, then you&#39;ll have to make sure the two lists are in sync (as well as use a modifiable list). In that case, it may make more sense to use an `ObservableList&lt;Label&gt;` and [bind the children list&#39;s content][2], assuming the `VBox` only contains those labels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://openjfx.io/javadoc/20/javafx.fxml/javafx/fxml/doc-files/introduction_to_fxml.html#read_only_list_property_elements\r\n  [2]: https://openjfx.io/javadoc/20/javafx.base/javafx/beans/binding/Bindings.html#bindContent(java.util.List,javafx.collections.ObservableList)\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html\r\n  [4]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html","title":"How to load array of Labels or other types into fxml scene?","body":"<h1>Problems</h1>\n<p>There are a few problems with this setup.</p>\n<h2>Interface as Element Type</h2>\n<p>You are telling the <code>FXMLLoader</code> to instantiate a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>List</code></a> <em>directly</em>.
