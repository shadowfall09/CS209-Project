I also tried <code>getAllPresent(a)</code> and <code>asMap()</code> but it gives equal performance.</p>\n<p>Library version is: <em>guava-11.0.1.jar</em></p>\n<p>LoadingCache is defined as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>LoadingCache&lt;TileKey, Bitmap&gt; tiles = CacheBuilder.newBuilder().maximumSize(100).build(new CacheLoader&lt;TileKey,Bitmap&gt;() {\n            @Override\n            public Bitmap load(TileKey tileKey) {\n            System.out.println(&quot;Loading in &quot; + Thread.currentThread().getName() + &quot; &quot;\n                + tileKey.x + &quot;-&quot; + tileKey.y);\n\n            final File[][] tileFiles = surfaceState.mapFile.getBuilding()\n                .getFloors().get(tileKey.floorid)\n                .getBackground(tileKey.zoomid).getTileFiles();\n            String tilePath = tileFiles[tileKey.y][tileKey.x].getAbsolutePath();\n\n            Options options = new BitmapFactory.Options();\n            options.inPreferredConfig = Bitmap.Config.RGB_565;\n\n            return BitmapFactory.decodeFile(tilePath, options);\n            }\n        });\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>My questions are:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do I use it wrong?</li>\n<li>Is its implementation unsuitable for Android?</li>\n<li>Did i miss a configuration option?</li>\n<li>Is this a known issue with the Cache that's being worked on?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Update:</p>\n<p>After about 100 frames painted the CacheStats are:</p>\n<pre><code>I/System.out( 6989): CacheStats{hitCount=11992, missCount=97,\nloadSuccessCount=77, loadExceptionCount=0, totalLoadTime=1402984624, evictionCount=0}\n</code></pre>\n<p>After that <code>missCount</code> stays basicly the same as <code>hitCount</code> increments. In this case the cache is big enough for loads to happen sparsely, but <code>getIfPresent()</code> is slow nontheless.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","swing"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":10610423,"reputation":1151,"user_id":7814526,"display_name":"JensS"},"score":3,"creation_date":1504731182,"post_id":46083858,"comment_id":79130321,"body_markdown":"Do you really want a JLayeredPane()?

The __first__ argument is the format string, and all the other arguments &#39;fill in&#39; the values for each `%x` used in the format string.\r\n\r\nYour first parameter is the name, so that&#39;s the format string, and then the rest fill in the values. Given that the name is e.g. `Bill Gates`, which includes zero `%x` style &#39;fill value in here&#39; placeholders, __all those further arguments are entirely ignored__.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;re looking for, presumably:\r\n\r\n```\r\nString.format(&quot;%20s%6d %20s %20s\\n&quot;, name, id, department, position);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that your setup cannot work: You use a tab to separate things, but you have no idea what tab does (it&#39;s operating system, user settings, and phase of the moon dependent), so there&#39;s no way to align things when using tabs. Forget tabs, use `%20s` and co: That will append whatever amount of spaces is required (on the left, i.e. the text becomes right-aligned) in order to print 20 characters. Only if the value you insert is longer than that, will your formatting break, but then, what else can `printf` do? If you want to turn `Joe Beauregard van Houten-Jenkins the Third, Esquire.` into `Joe Beauregard van H&#230;…`, you&#39;d have to write code. Something like:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString n = name.length() &gt; 20 ? (name.substring(0, 19) + &quot;…&quot;) : name;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus, something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid printHeader() {\r\n  System.out.printf(&quot;%20s %4s %20s %20s\\n&quot;, &quot;Name&quot;, &quot;ID&quot;, &quot;Department&quot;, &quot;Position&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe numbers in your header format string match the numbers in your actual &#39;print a line of data&#39;.

The <strong>first</strong> argument is the format string, and all the other arguments 'fill in' the values for each <code>%x</code> used in the format string.</p>\n<p>Your first parameter is the name, so that's the format string, and then the rest fill in the values. Given that the name is e.g. <code>Bill Gates</code>, which includes zero <code>%x</code> style 'fill value in here' placeholders, <strong>all those further arguments are entirely ignored</strong>.</p>\n<p>You're looking for, presumably:</p>\n<pre><code>String.format(&quot;%20s%6d %20s %20s\\n&quot;, name, id, department, position);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that your setup cannot work: You use a tab to separate things, but you have no idea what tab does (it's operating system, user settings, and phase of the moon dependent), so there's no way to align things when using tabs. Forget tabs, use <code>%20s</code> and co: That will append whatever amount of spaces is required (on the left, i.e. the text becomes right-aligned) in order to print 20 characters. Only if the value you insert is longer than that, will your formatting break, but then, what else can <code>printf</code> do? If you want to turn <code>Joe Beauregard van Houten-Jenkins the Third, Esquire.</code> into <code>Joe Beauregard van Hæ…</code>, you'd have to write code. Something like:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>String n = name.length() &gt; 20 ? (name.substring(0, 19) + &quot;…&quot;) : name;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thus, something like:</p>\n<pre><code>void printHeader() {\n  System.out.printf(&quot;%20s %4s %20s %20s\\n&quot;, &quot;Name&quot;, &quot;ID&quot;, &quot;Department&quot;, &quot;Position&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The numbers in your header format string match the numbers in your actual 'print a line of data'.

You have to actually call that method for it to run just making `private String[] tokens = {&quot;2&quot;,&quot;1&quot;,&quot;+&quot;,&quot;3&quot;,&quot;*&quot;};` isn&#39;t going to do anything. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Anyways heres a working example below** you can copy and paste the code and run it here (https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/online-compiler/). But right after you do that I highly recommend you watch this (https://youtu.be/eIrMbAQSU34) you need to clear up a lot of your miss conceptions about java.

Thus in,`Collections.sort(playlist1, Comparator.comparing(p1 -&gt; p1.getTitle()));` the expression `Comparator.comparing(p1 -&gt; p1.getTitle())` undergoes the type inference as:\r\n    - Since the target type is `Comparator&lt;Song&gt;`\r\n    - `Comparator.comparing(...)` will use the **Target Type** to determine the **type arguments**\r\n    - and thus infers that `p1` is of type `Song`.\r\n4. but if we consider **Expression-3** we will see **Compilation Error** as:\r\n    - `Comparator.comparing(...).thenComparing(...).thenComparing(...)` - has a **target type** of `Comparator&lt;Song&gt;`\r\n    - this is because for an invocation chain of this type: `ClassType.A().B().C()` the inference will have to proceed from `C() -&gt; B() -&gt; A() -&gt; ClassType`\r\n    - now the problem is that for the compiler - it is complete unknown that **which class is C() belonging to** and hence will **not be able to infer the chain upto `A`**.\r\n    - On the contrary - if the chain had been `ClassType.A()` - the compiler can easily determine that `A()` belongs to `ClassType`.\r\n   - and thus the compiler is unable to determine the `p1` and so on.\r\n\r\n**Is my thinking about the above points correct?

-Dexec.mainClass=com.example.myclass \\\n     -Dexec.args=\"--runner=DataflowRunner \\\n                  --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID \\\n

However, in general, for one `ID`, one could have complex multiple overlapping segments with arbitrary length, (a [segment tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_tree).)\r\n\r\nOne solution would use a map from the `ID` to a minimum heap on `LocalDate` in which one pre-calculates the `Integer` change in weight for the two ends, `Map&lt;Integer, &lt;LocalDate, Integer&gt;PriorityQueue&gt;`. Each record adds two `&lt;LocalDate, Integer&gt;` to the heap, one positive weight, and the later one the opposite.\r\n\r\nWhen one has read all the records, for each `ID`, we can remap to calculate the date range for the maximum lift.
