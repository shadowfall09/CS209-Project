I want to assign each day of the week to an int value, then add whatever number the user inputs to the int value, then the sum would be the new day.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>If theres a better way to do this please let me know, heres my code(sorry if it looks bad).</p>\n<pre><code>import java.util.Scanner;\npublic class Main\n{\npublic static void main(String\\[\\] args)\n{\n\n        Day.userInput();\n    }\n\n}\n\nclass Day\n{\nstatic int b;\npublic static void userInput()\n{\nScanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n// set day of week\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Please set the day of the week:&quot;);\nString day = scan.nextLine();\n\n        if(day.equals(&quot;sunday&quot;) || (day.equals(&quot;Sunday&quot;)) )\n        {\n          b = 1;\n        }\n        if(day.equals(&quot;monday&quot;) || (day.equals(&quot;Monday&quot;)) )\n        {\n            b = 2;\n        }\n        if(day.equals(&quot;tuesday&quot;) || (day.equals(&quot;Tuesday&quot;)) )\n        {\n            b = 3;\n        }\n        if(day.equals(&quot;wednesday&quot;) || (day.equals(&quot;Wednesday&quot;)) )\n        {\n            b = 4;\n        }\n        if(day.equals(&quot;thursday&quot;) || (day.equals(&quot;Thursday&quot;)) )\n        {\n            b = 5;\n        }\n        if(day.equals(&quot;friday&quot;) || (day.equals(&quot;Friday&quot;)) )\n        {\n            b = 6;\n        }\n        if(day.equals(&quot;saturday&quot;) || (day.equals(&quot;Saturday&quot;)) )\n        {\n            b = 7;\n        }\n    \n    \n        System.out.println(&quot;Enter 1 to return the day.\\nEnter 2 to return tomorrows day.\\nEnter 3 to return yesterdays day.\\nEnter 4 to add days to the current day.\\n&quot;);\n        int a = scan.nextInt();\n\n// return day\nif(a == 1)\n{\nSystem.out.println(&quot;The day is &quot; + day);\n}\n//return next day\nif(a == 2)\n{\nif ( b == 1)\n{\nSystem.out.println(&quot;The next day is Monday.&quot;);\n}\nif (b == 2)\n{\nSystem.out.println(&quot;The next day is Tuesday.&quot;);\n}\nif (b == 3)\n{\nSystem.out.println(&quot;The next day is Wednesday.&quot;);\n}\nif (b == 4)\n{\nSystem.out.println(&quot;The next day is Thursday.&quot;);\n}\nif (b == 5)\n{\nSystem.out.println(&quot;The next day is Friday.&quot;);\n}\nif (b == 6)\n{\nSystem.out.println(&quot;The next day is Saturday.&quot;);\n}\nif (b == 7)\n{\nSystem.out.println(&quot;The next day is Sunday.&quot;);\n}\n\n        }\n\n//return previous day\nif(a == 3)\n{\nif( b == 1)\n{\nSystem.out.println(&quot;The previous day was Saturday.&quot;);\n}\nif (b == 2)\n{\nSystem.out.println(&quot;The previous day was Sunday.&quot;);\n}\nif (b == 3)\n{\nSystem.out.println(&quot;The previous day was Monday.&quot;);\n}\nif (b == 4)\n{\nSystem.out.println(&quot;The previous day was Tuesday.&quot;);\n}\nif (b == 5)\n{\nSystem.out.println(&quot;The previous day was Wednesday.&quot;);\n}\nif (b == 6)\n{\nSystem.out.println(&quot;The previous day was Thursday.&quot;);\n}\nif (b == 7)\n{\nSystem.out.println(&quot;The previous day was Friday.&quot;);\n}\n}\n// add days  \nif(a == 4 )\n{\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Enter the number of days you want to add&quot;);\nint c = scan.nextInt();\n\n        }\n    \n    \n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I know a way I can do this but it'll take a massive amount of lines and if statements. `</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","thymeleaf"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":13170666,"reputation":78679,"user_id":9513184,"display_name":"Unmitigated"},"score":0,"creation_date":1684601359,"post_id":76296160,"comment_id":134542312,"body_markdown":"What are you trying to do?

Since it is unlikely for two keys to have the same <code>arrayIndex</code>, this <code>contains</code> call usually happens in <code>O(1)</code> time since the List only has one element, but since it's possible for there to be multiple elements in a worst-case scenario, it's actually <code>O(n)</code> in time for a true worst-case scenario.</p>\n<p><code>Map.containsKey</code> is only <code>O(1)</code> in time if the hashing function properly distributes the keys.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":26945933,"reputation":7,"user_id":20515929,"display_name":"Brendan B"},"comment_count":13,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":104,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1684635282,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1684636079,"creation_date":1684633953,"question_id":76297990,"body_markdown":"In other words, how can Map.containsKey() search without iterating over the elements in proper sequence like List.contains() does, which is what makes List.contains() have a linear time complexity?\r\n\r\n```\r\nList&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    list.add(1);\r\n    list.add(2);\r\n    list.add(3);\r\n    list.add(4);\r\n    list.add(5);\r\n    list.contains(5); // Linear Time Complexity\r\nMap&lt;Integer, Character&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n    map.put(1,&#39;a&#39;);\r\n    map.put(2,&#39;b&#39;);\r\n    map.put(3,&#39;c&#39;);\r\n    map.put(4,&#39;d&#39;);\r\n    map.put(5,&#39;e&#39;);\r\n    map.containsKey(5); // Only Constant Time Complexity\r\n```","title":"What makes HashMap.containsKey() have a constant time complexity while ArrayList.contains() has a linear time complexity in Java?","body":"<p>In other words, how can Map.containsKey() search without iterating over the elements in proper sequence like List.contains() does, which is what makes List.contains() have a linear time complexity?</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n    list.add(1);\n    list.add(2);\n    list.add(3);\n    list.add(4);\n    list.add(5);\n    list.contains(5); // Linear Time Complexity\nMap&lt;Integer, Character&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n    map.put(1,'a');\n    map.put(2,'b');\n    map.put(3,'c');\n    map.put(4,'d');\n    map.put(5,'e');\n    map.containsKey(5); // Only Constant Time Complexity\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","spring-boot","spring-data-jpa","spring-data"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":12347923,"reputation":185,"user_id":9008002,"display_name":"Ivan Baranuk"},"score":0,"creation_date":1684496761,"post_id":76287546,"comment_id":134529498,"body_markdown":"It is absolutly possible.

Maybe you want constructors that accept a <code>Month</code> enum constant and/or a <code>YearMonth</code> object directly and/or getters that return those types wrapped in <code>Optional</code>s.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Oracle tutorial: Date Time</a> explaining how to use java.time.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"display_name":"user6863891"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":900,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1684620486,"creation_date":1569763743,"question_id":58155682,"body_markdown":"I would like to store Date with optional month and day in java.\r\nI know of the [`java.time.LocalYear`][1] class to store just the year.\r\nShall I create my own custom class to hold dates with optional month and day or are there any custom library to solve the problem.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\npublic class Date {\r\n\r\n  private LocalYear year;\r\n  private int month;\r\n  private int day;\r\n\r\n  public Date(LocalYear year) {\r\n   this.year = year;\r\n  } \r\n  \r\n  public Date(LocalYear year, int month) {\r\n   this.year = year;\r\n   this.month = month;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public Date(LocalYear year, int month, iny day) {\r\n   this.year = year;\r\n   this.month = month;\r\n   this.day = day;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Year.html","title":"java: represent Date with optional month and day","body":"<p>I would like to store Date with optional month and day in java.\nI know of the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Year.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>java.time.LocalYear</code></a> class to store just the year.\nShall I create my own custom class to hold dates with optional month and day or are there any custom library to solve the problem.</p>\n<pre><code>\npublic class Date {\n\n  private LocalYear year;\n  private int month;\n  private int day;\n\n  public Date(LocalYear year) {\n   this.year = year;\n  } \n  \n  public Date(LocalYear year, int month) {\n   this.year = year;\n   this.month = month;\n  }\n\n  public Date(LocalYear year, int month, iny day) {\n   this.year = year;\n   this.month = month;\n   this.day = day;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","flutter","path"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":14061061,"reputation":56960,"user_id":10157127,"display_name":"Md.
