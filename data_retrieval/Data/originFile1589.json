What it does is a black box, but you do know that it requires exactly one parameter, which must be of type `float`, it does... something... and then it returns some sort of `int`. The java language specification does not know about its existence, and therefore confers nothing special about how it works or what it does.\r\n\r\nTherefore, trivially, given that &#39;casting&#39; is fundamentally a thing that the language spec covers, __`Math.round(float)` cannot be said to &#39;implicitly cast&#39;__. It&#39;s not about whether it does or doesn&#39;t - it&#39;s about the notion that the question is nonsense in the first place, therefore no answer is available.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, it&#39;s not really a mystery meat sandwich: There is javadoc that explains what it does, and you can trust that the javadoc isn&#39;t lying to you.

Which path should i give in the script if i have to run this script in bamboo?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","time-complexity"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":8087973,"reputation":1175,"user_id":6094911,"display_name":"ksohan"},"score":0,"creation_date":1644948904,"post_id":71131383,"comment_id":125739061,"body_markdown":"How do you compute that ```*``` is being printed ```n!``` times?","body":"How do you compute that <code>*</code> is being printed <code>n!</code> times?"},{"owner":{"account_id":195854,"reputation":159194,"user_id":438992,"accept_rate":90,"display_name":"Dave Newton"},"score":0,"creation_date":1644948922,"post_id":71131383,"comment_id":125739067,"body_markdown":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/526728/438992","body":"<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/526728/438992\">stackoverflow.com/q/526728/438992</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":9760,"reputation":85859,"user_id":18157,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Jim Garrison"},"score":3,"creation_date":1644948929,"post_id":71131383,"comment_id":125739070,"body_markdown":"O(n!) is much bigger than O(n^2).

As requests are handled, a worker thread is pulled from a thread pool to process the request. Meanwhile, the <em>request thread</em> is blocked until it’s notified by the worker thread that it’s finished.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was under the impression that servlet containers like Tomcat do something like this under the hood (very simplified, of course):</p>\n<pre><code>while (true) {\n    Socket socket = serverSocket.accept();\n    // the actual handling of request is done by Servlet-based framework and application code.\n    workerThreadPool.submit(() -&gt; handleRequest(socket));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I mean, we do not create a thread for each connection but reuse existing worker threads.</p>\n<p>Also I'm not sure what a request thread is. I thought it could be the thread in which we <code>accept()</code> connections, but this thread doesn't block until request has been processed. My understanding is that with Spring Boot and embedded Tomcat worker threads are the ones with names http-nio-8889-exec-* (see VisualVM screenshot). What is the request thread here?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eevxG.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eevxG.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>So, my questions are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What important things are missing in the pseudocode above?</li>\n<li>Does Spring MVC (or servlet container) actually create a <em>thread per each connection</em>?</li>\n<li>What is the role of request thread (or threads) and who creates them?

So any member property you add will be present in each and every named object.</p>\n<p>In this next example we add the member property <code>hex</code> of type <code>String</code> to each of the <code>Rgb</code> enum objects seen above.</p>\n<pre><code>enum Rgb { \n    RED( &quot;FF0000&quot; ) , GREEN( &quot;00FF00&quot; ) , BLUE( &quot;0000FF&quot; ) ;\n    private String hex ; // Hexadecimal representation. \n    private Rgb( String hex ) { this.hex = hex ; } ;\n    public String getHex() { return this.hex ; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Ways to associate objects</h1>\n<p>If you want to associate various objects together by name, use the other features of Java.</p>\n<p>You could define a <code>Map</code> to track a collection of key-value pairs. See <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/map.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tutorial</a> by Oracle.</p>\n<pre><code>Map&lt; String, LocalDate &gt; contracts = new HashMap&lt;&gt;() ;\ncontracts.put( someContractorName , someHireDate ) ;\ncontracts.put( otherContractorName , otherHireDate ) ;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or define a class to hold the parts together. If the main purpose of the class is to carry data transparently and immutably, define your class as a <a href=\"https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/395\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">record</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>record Contract ( String contractorName , LocalDate whenHired ) {}\nContract pavement = new Contract ( &quot;Acme Pavement Company&quot; , LocalDate.of( 2023, Month.JANUARY , 23 ) ) ;\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":2617457,"reputation":33,"user_id":2266229,"display_name":"Alex A"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":444,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":71113761,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1644945601,"creation_date":1644849517,"question_id":71113604,"body_markdown":"How can I store different types in enum and accessing them without need of casting?\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic enum PlugsEnum {\r\n\r\n    LOCAL_DATE(LocalDate.of(9999,12,31)),\r\n    \r\n    CONTRACTORNAME(&quot;autoname&quot;);\r\n\r\n    @Getter\r\n    private final Object code;\r\n\r\n    PlugsEnum(Object code) {\r\n        this.code = code;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nLocalDate localDate = (LocalDate) PlugsEnum.LOCAL_DATE.getCode()\r\n```","title":"getCode of Enum of different types in JAVA","body":"<p>How can I store different types in enum and accessing them without need of casting?</p>\n<pre><code>public enum PlugsEnum {\n\n    LOCAL_DATE(LocalDate.of(9999,12,31)),\n    \n    CONTRACTORNAME(&quot;autoname&quot;);\n\n    @Getter\n    private final Object code;\n\n    PlugsEnum(Object code) {\n        this.code = code;\n    }\n\n}\n\nLocalDate localDate = (LocalDate) PlugsEnum.LOCAL_DATE.getCode()\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","mysql","web-scraping","web-applications","jsoup"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4181404,"reputation":6036,"user_id":3426328,"accept_rate":83,"display_name":"TDG"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1644945580,"creation_date":1644945580,"answer_id":71130689,"question_id":71116068,"body_markdown":"You can start with looping over the table&#39;s rows: the selector for the table is `.cs-table` so you can get the table with `Element table = doc.select(&quot;.cs-table&quot;).first();`.

In the worst case, you get an order which let’s you copy again the same data you’ve just copied, for every step, ending up at O(N&#178;) time complexity.\r\n\r\nThe approach above skips the entire task of creating new strings or copying characters, making each step as cheap as two variable assignments.\r\n\r\nNote that even if you’re going back to implement the task literally, i.e. to produce a single `String`, you can do it by replacing the final printing loop by a loop which appends all strings to a single `StringBuilder`. This will still be a *linear* operation, as appending all strings in the already determined final order implies copying each string only once, instead of repeatedly.\r\n\r\nBut as long as the success is measured by the output written to `System.out`, you don’t need to construct a final `String` object.","title":"How to solve this java problem efficiently","body":"<p>Don’t implement this task literally.</p>\n<p>The entire task is designed such that you end up with all <code>N</code> input strings being concatenated in one string, the order determined by the numbers read from <code>System.in</code>.</p>\n<p>But the result is not the concatenated string.
