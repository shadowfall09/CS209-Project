I took your advice and posted the revised code in a second edit to my posting above.  The code is still throwing the null pointer exception.  I posted the stack trace above as well.  The reason I am using static variables is that eclipse forces me to do so because main() is static.  I tried to get around this by putting the code in a separate method called from main(), but eclipse still demands everything be static. Help on that would be appreciated.  I call a new Random() every time to simulate a resource intensive algorithm for testing purposes."},{"owner":{"account_id":426537,"reputation":9134,"user_id":807797,"accept_rate":72,"display_name":"CodeMed"},"score":0,"creation_date":1372712667,"post_id":17395638,"comment_id":25288603,"body_markdown":"I think the problem is that the threads with the new data have not yet returned when System.arraycopy(data2D[k], 0, data1D, startPos, data2D[k].length); tries to collapse them into a 1D array.","body":"I think the problem is that the threads with the new data have not yet returned when System.arraycopy(data2D[k], 0, data1D, startPos, data2D[k].length); tries to collapse them into a 1D array."},{"owner":{"account_id":426537,"reputation":9134,"user_id":807797,"accept_rate":72,"display_name":"CodeMed"},"score":0,"creation_date":1372714786,"post_id":17395638,"comment_id":25289578,"body_markdown":"I think the problem is that the code needs a Future object to make sure that the ExecutorService has returned all its data slices before the various slices can be assembled in proper order into the final 1D array.

Here is a quick recap:\r\n\r\n1. Install Node.js and npm.\r\n2. Initialize a package.json in your project root:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm init -y \r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Install commitlint and Husky:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install @commitlint/{config-conventional,cli} husky --save-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Configure commitlint:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\necho &quot;module.exports = {extends: [&#39;@commitlint/config-conventional&#39;]};&quot; &gt; commitlint.config.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Configure Husky:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpx husky install\r\nnpx husky add .husky/commit-msg &#39;npx --no-install commitlint --edit &quot;$1&quot;&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Combining Both\r\n\r\nIf you want to ensure that all checks pass before committing the code, you can add a pre-commit hook with Husky to run `./gradlew spotlessCheck`. Here&#39;s how you can do it:\r\n\r\n1. First, install Husky and lint-staged:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install --save-dev husky lint-staged\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add a lint-staged configuration in your `package.json`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n&quot;lint-staged&quot;: {\r\n  &quot;*.java&quot;: [\r\n    &quot;./gradlew spotlessApply&quot;,\r\n    &quot;git add&quot;\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Install husky hooks:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpx husky install\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Add pre-commit and commit-msg hooks:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpx husky add .husky/pre-commit &quot;npx lint-staged&quot;\r\nnpx husky add .husky/commit-msg &#39;npx --no-install commitlint --edit &quot;$1&quot;&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis setup will run Spotless to format your Java files and add them to the commit. Then it will check the commit message using commitlint.

[Now that&#39;s modernization!][3] \r\n\r\nThe basic idea is that values used in versions will be collected from the [DVCS][4] (`Git`, `SVN`, etc.) and the [CIS][5] (`Jenkins`, `Travis CI`, `GitLab`, etc.) at build time and used to modify or set the POM/release version. These values are things like the build number, the shortened Git hash or anything else. \r\n\r\n**Procedure to implement CI Friendly Maven builds:** \r\n- Maven [supports only a handful of properties][6] in the `&lt;version&gt;` tag. These are `${revision}`, `${changelist}` and `${sha1}`.\r\n- You can either use a hardcoded value and the acceptable properties or just something like `${revision}`. **NOTE:** I now recommend `${revision}`.\r\n- In the `&lt;properties&gt;`, set values to acceptable defaults -- fake values that become clear they are from non-build machines, like `0` for the build number.\r\n- In the `&lt;properties&gt;`, assemble the value for `&lt;revision&gt;`, e.g. the version, from other properties and hardcoded values. For instance, `&lt;revision&gt;1.0.0b${changelist}-${sha1}&lt;/revision&gt;`.\r\n- At build time, use `-D` flags to set the actual values. For instance, the `${BUILD_NUMBER}` value is injected to every Jenkins build -- `-Dchangelist=${BUILD_NUMBER}`.\r\n- You now have the flexibility to change the version number components.\r\n\r\nIn the CI pipelines you can now detect the commit branch and perform releases from `master` by clearing all or some of these values. For instance, feature branches can calculate and add the Git hash. The semantic version is set above -- Developers now own and control it. They must know their code to make changes, and they have the freedom to increment the semantic version. It&#39;s a lot of valuable flexibility. \r\n\r\nThe sound reasoning here, though, is to speed up things and get rid of a heavyweight process that really adds little to no relevant information that ties code to its precise origin. By using CI Friendly versions you will let deployers, testers and sysadmins see the compile number and code commit hash that allows the problem to be precisely correlated to an actual code release. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that this requires a bit of philosophical flexibility to accept a paradigm shift. Change is good, and ditching the release plugin will make your release pipelines better. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/\r\n  [2]: https://axelfontaine.com/blog/dead-burried.html\r\n  [3]: https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/sites/default/files/presentations/SCaLE-18x-Maven_Renewed_u2.pdf\r\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control\r\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration\r\n  [6]: https://maven.apache.org/maven-ci-friendly.html","title":"Maven Release Plugin together with cifriendly versions","body":"<p>The CI Friendly version scheme is intended to replace the <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maven Release Plugin</a>, <em>not</em> complement it.
