Until now everything is ok, but I need to show this progress to the client. So the REST API should send this progress as a response.</p>\n<p>I will do something like that:</p>\n<p>So the client should receive 10 seconds, 20 seconds, ... until 5 minutes. But how can I send this dynamic response with a REST API? Can I do that on the /execute REST API that execute the task and get that progress or should I have 2 REST API, one /execute and another /get-progress?

This is my project for studies. According to the project requirements, the game board (maze) must be implemented with JTable(AbstractTableModel). Moreover, the game window must be scalable, and the user chooses the number of board cells. Scaling the maze to the window works correctly. I assumed that the minimum size of a JTable cell must be 10x10 px. Due to the goal of achieving smooth animation, I do not want to render the cell in which Pacman is located, but rather ensure its movement based on px.\r\nCould any of you help me understand what is wrong? After a few days of struggling with this functionality, I&#39;m starting to get a little stressed.\r\nI will add that there is also something wrong with the movement itself. Pacman only moves when the cells are slightly larger. Adds the code of several classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage view;\r\n\r\nimport model.GameModel;\r\nimport model.PacmanModel;\r\nimport util.CustomTableModel;\r\n\r\nimport javax.swing.*;\r\nimport java.awt.*;\r\nimport java.awt.event.ComponentAdapter;\r\nimport java.awt.event.ComponentEvent;\r\n\r\npublic class GameFrame extends JFrame {\r\n\r\n    private GameModel gameModel;\r\n    private PacmanView pacmanView;\r\n    private GameTable gameTable;\r\n    private JLayeredPane layeredPane;\r\n\r\n    public GameFrame(String title, GameModel gameModel) {\r\n        super(title);\r\n        this.gameModel = gameModel;\r\n\r\n        setUpFrame();\r\n        initializeComponents();\r\n        addEventListeners();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void setUpFrame() {\r\n        setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\r\n        setResizable(true);\r\n        setMaximizedBounds(new Rectangle(getMaxScreenBounds()));\r\n        setLayout(new BorderLayout());\r\n        setLocationRelativeTo(null);\r\n        setVisible(true);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void initializeComponents() {\r\n        layeredPane = new JLayeredPane();\r\n\r\n        CustomTableModel customTableModel = new CustomTableModel(gameModel);\r\n        gameTable = new GameTable(customTableModel);\r\n        gameModel.setGameTable(gameTable);\r\n        gameModel.initializePacman();\r\n        gameTable.setOpaque(false);\r\n        gameTable.setFillsViewportHeight(true);\r\n\r\n        PacmanModel pacmanModel = gameModel.getPacman();\r\n        pacmanView = new PacmanView(pacmanModel);\r\n\r\n        // Ustawienie początkowych wymiar&#243;w na podstawie minimalnych wymiar&#243;w kom&#243;rek\r\n        int initialWidth = gameTable.getColumnCount() * 10;

This is my project for studies. According to the project requirements, the game board (maze) must be implemented with JTable(AbstractTableModel). Moreover, the game window must be scalable, and the user chooses the number of board cells. Scaling the maze to the window works correctly. I assumed that the minimum size of a JTable cell must be 10x10 px. Due to the goal of achieving smooth animation, I do not want to render the cell in which Pacman is located, but rather ensure its movement based on px.\nCould any of you help me understand what is wrong? After a few days of struggling with this functionality, I'm starting to get a little stressed.\nI will add that there is also something wrong with the movement itself. Pacman only moves when the cells are slightly larger.

Start with a pull request, not starting from scratch. \r\n\r\nFor supplemental reading, a **fully-functional** `docker-compose`, and network diagrams, see [this blog by @rmoff](https://confluent.io/blog/kafka-listeners-explained/)\r\n\r\n# Answer\r\n\r\n[The Confluent quickstart (Docker) document](https://docs.confluent.io/current/quickstart/ce-docker-quickstart.html) assumes all produce and consume requests will be within the Docker network. \r\n\r\nYou could fix the problem of connecting to `kafka:9092` by running your Kafka client code within its own container as that uses the Docker network bridge, but otherwise you&#39;ll need to add some more environment variables for exposing the container externally, while still having it work within the Docker network. \r\n\r\nFirst add a protocol mapping of `PLAINTEXT_HOST:PLAINTEXT` that will map the listener protocol to a Kafka protocol \r\n\r\nKey: `KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP`  \r\nValue: `PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT_HOST:PLAINTEXT`\r\n\r\nThen setup two advertised listeners on different ports. (`kafka` here refers to the docker container name; it might also be named `broker`, so double check your service + hostnames).  \r\n\r\nKey: `KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS`  \r\nValue: `PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092,PLAINTEXT_HOST://localhost:29092`\r\n\r\n**Notice the protocols here match the left-side values of the protocol mapping setting above** \r\n\r\nWhen running the container, add `-p 29092:29092` for the host port mapping, and advertised `PLAINTEXT_HOST` listener. \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nSo... (**with the above settings**) \r\n\r\n&gt; If something **still** doesn&#39;t work, `KAFKA_LISTENERS` can be set to include `&lt;PROTOCOL&gt;://0.0.0.0:&lt;PORT&gt;` where both options match the advertised setting and Docker-forwarded port \r\n\r\n### Client on same machine, not in a container \r\n\r\nAdvertising localhost and the associated port will let you connect outside of the container, as you&#39;d expect. \r\n\r\nIn other words, when running any Kafka Client **outside** the Docker network (including CLI tools you might have installed locally), use `localhost:29092` for bootstrap servers and `localhost:2181` for Zookeeper (requires Docker port forwarding) \r\n\r\n### Client on another machine \r\n\r\nIf trying to connect from an external server, you&#39;ll need to advertise the external hostname/ip (e.g. `192.168.x.y`) of the host ***as well as/in place of localhost***.  \r\nSimply advertising localhost with a port forward  will not work because Kafka protocol will still continue to advertise the listeners you&#39;ve configured.  \r\n\r\nThis setup requires Docker port forwarding **and** router port forwarding (and firewall / security group changes) if not in the same local network, for example, your container is running in the cloud and you want to interact with it from your local machine. \r\n\r\n### Client (or another broker) in a container, on the same host\r\n\r\nThis is the least error-prone configuration; you can use DNS service names directly. \r\n\r\nWhen running an app **in the Docker network**, use `kafka:9092` (see advertised `PLAINTEXT` listener config above) for bootstrap servers and `zookeeper:2181` for Zookeeper, just like any other Docker service communication (doesn&#39;t require any port forwarding)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you use separate `docker run` commands, or Compose files, you need to define a shared `network` manually using compose `networks` section or `docker network --create`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[See the example Compose file for the full Confluent stack](https://github.com/confluentinc/examples/blob/5.3.1-post/cp-all-in-one/docker-compose.yml) or [more minimal one](https://github.com/conduktor/kafka-stack-docker-compose/blob/v6.2.1/zk-single-kafka-single.yml) for a single broker.\r\n\r\nIf using multiple brokers, then they need to use unique hostnames + advertised listeners.

Note that files are bytes, but text search implies charset encoding.\r\n\r\nThat means &#39;I will just chunk up the file in 2MB chunks&#39; could mean a chunk can start in the middle of a character (charset encodings like UTF-8 can take more than 1 byte to store a character) which complicates matters. One solution is to take your &#39;needle&#39; (the string you are searching for), turn that into bytes (e.g. `needle.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)`), and search for _those_.\r\n\r\n2. There are 2 ways to solve the &#39;what if the haystack contains the needle, but my chunking process chunks halfway through a needle?&#39; issue.\r\n\r\n## Overlap\r\n\r\nIf &#39;needle&#39; is small, you can overlap. Say you have a 9MB file, you want to chunk in 2MB blocks, and needle is 50 bytes long. The overlap solution dictates that you extend the endpoint of every chunk 49 bytes (1 less than the size of needle). So, the first chunk isn&#39;t precisely 0-2097151 (2MB worth). It&#39;s 49 more than that - it goes from 0 to 2097200. And the second chunk _does_ start at 2097151 (there is 49 overlap). This way it&#39;s still not possible for both chunks to report the needle, but you are guaranteed that if there is a needle right at that boundary, one of em will. This becomes unwieldy if the needle is very large.\r\n\r\n## Half-match passing\r\n\r\nA solution that can deal with large needles is to pass boundary half matches to a collector.\r\n\r\nGenerally in such multithread jobs you use the map-reduce concept:\r\n\r\n1. you map some input into chunks.\r\n2. Each chunk is independent (to calculate the result for a chunk, you just need the data in it; you do not need to know about any data from beyond the chunk).\r\n3. A number of working threads pull &#39;chunk jobs&#39; (a simple descriptor describing the chunk to work on) off the pipe and map them to a muuuch smaller, simpler result value.\r\n4. A final thread gathers all results and reduces them. Optimally, this is streaming (any 2+ chunks can be reduced to a single one), but it&#39;s generally fine if this process cannot reduce until all chunk results are in. It&#39;s fine if the reducer needs, for example, the results of contiguous chunks to do its job.\r\n\r\nThis model means you can half-match. The thread that processes a single, say, 2 MB chunk of data turns that into a result. A result consists of any number of &#39;found it!&#39; entries, and they come in 3 flavours:\r\n\r\n* Found a needle at X. (In the chunk, the entire needle is present starting at bytepos X and ending at bytepos X+needlesize).\r\n* Found a needle-suffix of length Y (The chunk _starts with_ a bunch of bytes that overlap with _the end_ of the needle. For example, the needle is `Hello, World!` and this chunk starts with `orld!`. That does not mean a needle is actually found, but it is part of what this chunk processor must report to the reducer.\r\n* Same, but on the other side: Found a needle-prefix of length Y (the chunk ends in `Hello, Wor`).\r\n\r\nThe reducer can line up reports of needle-prefixes and needle-suffixes (e.g. for `Hello, World!`, which is 13 long, if chunk 14 reports &#39;needle-prefix = 8&#39; and chunk 15 reports &#39;needle-suffix=5`, there&#39;s a needle in the file at chunk15start minus 8.\r\n\r\nThe nananananaba issue (which is what Boyer Moore tries to solve) must also be applied here! If needle is &#39;nananaba&#39; and one chunk ends in &#39;nanana&#39; and the next chunk starts with &#39;nanaba&#39;, then there is a needle there, but it doesn&#39;t start at the first chunk&#39;s &#39;nanana&#39;. It starts 4 characters later.\r\n\r\nThis model is called map-reduce:\r\n\r\nEach chunk processor _maps_ the input data onto an intermediate result value. Generally results are vastly smaller than inputs.\r\n\r\nA single reducer (sometimes running on its own dedicated thread, but it can simply be done by a worker thread in between doing a _mapping_ operation) will take multiple _mappings_ (these result values) and reduce them down to a single result value. Keep going until there&#39;s only one such result value left, from which it should be trivial to produce the required answer. The job of squashing 2+ _mappings_ down to a single one is called _reducing_.\r\n\r\nHence, map-reduce. You can read on e.g. wikipedia for more details if you are intrigued.\r\n\r\n3. __This is probably pointless__\r\n\r\nIt depends on lots of factors, but on many, many systems, using multiple threads to do extremely basic processing (and this is extremely basic, even Boyer-Moore is) on files read from disk __is pointless__ - the disk is the bottleneck, not the CPU. For example, trivially, on spinning disks (which, admittedly, are kinda old news now), __this will be significantly slower__, because to provide data to all the 20 or whatnot threads all asking for data, the disk needs to spin and spin, giving each thread data from separate slices of the disk. The disk is __entirely__ the bottleneck so the only job is to ensure the disk can provide the bytes as efficiently as possible. Which is, for a contiguous file (one where all bytes are layered one after another), is best done by having __one thread read the bytes from start to finish in one go__.\r\n\r\nAt the other extreme, some sort of fast-NVMe multi-raid getup means contiguous access has no bearing on performance, and the CPU is probably the bottleneck and not the raid setup, so there multi-core _would_ help.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d bet on multicore making things, if anything, slower. Processing 20GB worth of data off a middling speed disk is going to take a few seconds. Throwing threads at the problem isn&#39;t going to change this.\r\n\r\n4. How to determine chunk size?\r\n\r\nIt mostly doesn&#39;t matter. But, fire up the right number of threads.\r\n\r\nGenerally you know how many threads you want (usually about 2x the amount of CPU cores you have, but, really, &#39;CPU cores amount of threads&#39; is all you need). Thus, you can figure out chunk size by taking total file size and dividing by that. However, it really doesn&#39;t matter. __Assuming a disk that does not care whatsoever about how you pull bytes off of it__ (highly unlikely, see the previous point!) -  If you have a 10TB file and go with a chunk size of, say, 512MB, that means 2048 chunks. It&#39;s rather unlikely your CPU has 2048 cores. It doesn&#39;t matter though: If it has 20 cores, have 20 threads running, and each thread will just process a 500MB chunk, then move on to another chunk to work on, it&#39;s not going to have a meaningful effect on how fast this process is going to go. As long as the chunk sizes aren&#39;t extremist (a chunk size of, say, 20 bytes, that&#39;s going to be a problem), and all the cores will generally be busy (trivial case: If 10 chunks total and 20 cores, that&#39;d be bad, you want at least 20 jobs. Preferably more like 200 so things can balance out if some chunks end up getting processed much faster than other ones) - you&#39;ll be fine.\r\n\r\nThe fork/join framework is designed for this stuff, you might want to look into it.\r\n","title":"How to find certain lines in file using Java","body":"<p>You seem to be asking for notes and hints about how to solve this problem.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Note that files are bytes, but text search implies charset encoding.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That means 'I will just chunk up the file in 2MB chunks' could mean a chunk can start in the middle of a character (charset encodings like UTF-8 can take more than 1 byte to store a character) which complicates matters.

That&#39;s why cookies have a flag called `SameSite` to try to prevent such attacks.\r\n\r\nBy using a JWT in the way you want you instead open up to a completely different flora of other types of attacks.\r\n\r\nSome vulnerabilities when using JWTs as sessions:\r\n - XSS attacks, since the JWT is accessible to JavaScript, if someone manages to execute JS code on your site, they will be able to steal your token, or do requests with the token.\r\n - No way of storing the token securely, [OWASP clearly recommends not storing sensitive information in local storage][1], and that includes JWT&#39;s and other tokens, since local storage is accessible to Javascript.\r\n- No way of logging out the user. A JWT is signed and self contained, which means its stateless and you can not revoke an issued token. You NEED state to be able to log someone out, how would the server otherwise know that someones token is invalid? [This is also mentioned by OWASP][2]. **If you delete the token client side does not mean the user is logged out.**\r\n- Since you cant logout a user (read previous point) means that you can also not invalidate tokens and logout devices. If you have ever used facebook, google, etc. there is a feature that says you can logout all devices. You cant do that with JWT&#39;s. They need to time out, all of them. \r\n \r\nThe latest [OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice][3] draft from ietf posted on 23 October 2023 [deprecates the *implicit grant* flow][4] which is the flow that issues tokens straight out to clients, because there are several redirect and referral vulnerabilities that can be utilized by malicious actors to trick users to login and pass the token to the malicious actor instead.\r\n\r\nJWT is a data format to sign data. That&#39;s what it is, nothing more, nothing less. They weren&#39;t designed to replace sessions. During all the years, cookies have existed they have been exploited in different ways and like a cat and mouse game the world has updated them to protect from newer and newer types of attacks. The flags, `Secured`, `httpOnly` and `SameSite` are all constructs because internet has learnt, iterated, and become more secure.\r\n\r\nThese are features that don&#39;t exist in JWT&#39;s, so by using JWTs as sessions we are basically taking a 15 year leap back in time to an internet where credential stealing using XSS was a thing.\r\n\r\nThe only place JWTs have a role in modern security is for server to server communication, between either a BFF and an issuer (google, facebook), where the server keeps the JWT and issues cookies to the browser.\r\n\r\nOr server to server communication within private networks, for one-shot requests.

That's why cookies have a flag called <code>SameSite</code> to try to prevent such attacks.</p>\n<p>By using a JWT in the way you want you instead open up to a completely different flora of other types of attacks.</p>\n<p>Some vulnerabilities when using JWTs as sessions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>XSS attacks, since the JWT is accessible to JavaScript, if someone manages to execute JS code on your site, they will be able to steal your token, or do requests with the token.</li>\n<li>No way of storing the token securely, <a href=\"https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTML5_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#local-storage\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OWASP clearly recommends not storing sensitive information in local storage</a>, and that includes JWT's and other tokens, since local storage is accessible to Javascript.</li>\n<li>No way of logging out the user. A JWT is signed and self contained, which means its stateless and you can not revoke an issued token. You NEED state to be able to log someone out, how would the server otherwise know that someones token is invalid? <a href=\"https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/JSON_Web_Token_for_Java_Cheat_Sheet.html#no-built-in-token-revocation-by-the-user\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This is also mentioned by OWASP</a>. <strong>If you delete the token client side does not mean the user is logged out.</strong></li>\n<li>Since you cant logout a user (read previous point) means that you can also not invalidate tokens and logout devices. If you have ever used facebook, google, etc. there is a feature that says you can logout all devices. You cant do that with JWT's. They need to time out, all of them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The latest <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice</a> draft from ietf posted on 23 October 2023 <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics#name-implicit-grant\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">deprecates the <em>implicit grant</em> flow</a> which is the flow that issues tokens straight out to clients, because there are several redirect and referral vulnerabilities that can be utilized by malicious actors to trick users to login and pass the token to the malicious actor instead.</p>\n<p>JWT is a data format to sign data. That's what it is, nothing more, nothing less. They weren't designed to replace sessions. During all the years, cookies have existed they have been exploited in different ways and like a cat and mouse game the world has updated them to protect from newer and newer types of attacks. The flags, <code>Secured</code>, <code>httpOnly</code> and <code>SameSite</code> are all constructs because internet has learnt, iterated, and become more secure.</p>\n<p>These are features that don't exist in JWT's, so by using JWTs as sessions we are basically taking a 15 year leap back in time to an internet where credential stealing using XSS was a thing.</p>\n<p>The only place JWTs have a role in modern security is for server to server communication, between either a BFF and an issuer (google, facebook), where the server keeps the JWT and issues cookies to the browser.</p>\n<p>Or server to server communication within private networks, for one-shot requests.

This is stateful session management, and it stores all the data relating to the user in a Map or something in memory by default against the provided jsessionid.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t like this for 2 reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The sessions stored in memory will of course be wiped if the application shuts down for any reason. This can be remedied by storing session information in a database or redis, but then that&#39;s an extra database request on every single authorized HTTP request to fetch the relevant information about the session.\r\n\r\n2. Cookie-based authentication/authorization is in general vulnerable to CSRF attacks, since all cookies are sent along with whatever request is being made for the domain the cookie is stored for. This doesn&#39;t change when https is involved, the cookies are just encrypted in that case, but they&#39;re sent all the same. Having something like an Authorization header-based scheme means that any random request to an API won&#39;t just be magically authenticated, it requires some javascript in the front-end to actually attach that header.\r\n\r\nI want to address both of these by using JWT tokens provided in an Authorization header, instead of a JSESSIONID. The way I want to do this is, in the response from the callback from my app, I would like to provide the header along with a JWT token that I generate after I send the authorization code to the auth service and get back an access token. Note: the JWT I provide to the browser **will not** be the same as the access token I get from the auth service. That will be stored somewhere ( database, redis, w/e ) for later use, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThat about covers what I&#39;m trying to accomplish. Please, if anyone&#39;s done this before, or has relevant information/articles/documentation on how to get it done, I would appreciate it greatly.

required, but none of those JAR file I got copying from Websphere MQ client installation seem to work. And also it feels kinda strange that some provider specific class is needed to make a query against JNDI. \nI already read a lot of topics at IBM and mqseries, but nothing helps. Any assistance would by higly appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>Also with every run there is also a newly generated FDC file with more detailed

// You don&#39;t want to limit yourself to just ArrayList\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnother example would be always declaring variable an `InputStream` even though it is usually a `FileInputStream` or a `BufferedInputStream`, because one day soon you or somebody else will want to use some other kind of `InputStream`.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/util/List.html#of-E...-\r\n  [2]: http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/269","title":"Initialization of an ArrayList in one line","body":"<h1>The simple answer</h1>\n<h2>Java 9 or later:</h2>\n<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; strings = List.of(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/List.html#immutable\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>List.of(...)</code></a> will give you an <em>immutable</em> <code>List</code>, so it cannot be changed.<br />\nWhich is what you want in most cases where you're prepopulating it.</p>\n<p>This does not allow <code>null</code> elements.</p>\n<h2>Java 8 or earlier:</h2>\n<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; strings = Arrays.asList(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#asList-T...-\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>Arrays.asList(...)</code></a> will give you a <code>List</code><sup>*</sup> backed by an array, so it cannot change length.<br />\nBut you can call <code>List.set(...)</code>, so it's still <em>mutable</em>.</p>\n<p>This does allow <code>null</code> elements.</p>\n<p><sup>*<sub>\nImplementation detail: It's a private nested class inside <code>java.util.Arrays</code>, named <code>ArrayList</code>,<br />\nwhich is a different class from <code>java.util.ArrayList</code>, even though their simple names are the same.</sub></sup></p>\n<h3>Static import</h3>\n<p>You can make Java 8 <code>Arrays.asList</code> even shorter with a static import:</p>\n<pre><code>import static java.util.Arrays.asList;  \n...\nList&lt;String&gt; strings = asList(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Any modern IDE<sup>*</sup> will suggest and do this for you.</p>\n<p>I don't recommend statically importing the <code>List.of</code> method as just <code>of</code>, because it's confusing.</p>\n<p><sup>*<sub>\nFor example, in IntelliJ IDEA you press <code>Alt+Enter</code> and select <code>Static import method...</code></sub></sup></p>\n<h1>Using <code>Stream</code>s</h1>\n<p>Why does it have to be a <code>List</code>?<br />\nWith Java 8 or later you can use a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>Stream</code></a> which is more flexible:</p>\n<pre><code>Stream&lt;String&gt; strings = Stream.of(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can concatenate <code>Stream</code>s:</p>\n<pre><code>Stream&lt;String&gt; strings = Stream.concat(Stream.of(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;),\n                                       Stream.of(&quot;baz&quot;, &quot;qux&quot;));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or you can go from a <code>Stream</code> to a <code>List</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>import static java.util.stream.Collectors.toList;\n...\nvar strings = Stream.of(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;).toList(); // Java 16\n\nList&lt;String&gt; strings = Stream.of(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;).collect(toList()); // Java 8\n</code></pre>\n<p>But preferably, just use the <code>Stream</code> without collecting it to a <code>List</code>.</p>\n<h1>If you specifically need a <code>java.util.ArrayList</code><sup>*</sup></h1>\n<p>If you want to <em>both</em> prepopulate an <code>ArrayList</code> <em>and</em> add to it afterwards, use</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; strings = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(List.of(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;));\n</code></pre>\n<p>or in Java 8 or earlier:</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; strings = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(asList(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;));\n</code></pre>\n<p>or using <code>Stream</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>import static java.util.stream.Collectors.toCollection;\n\nList&lt;String&gt; strings = Stream.of(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)\n                             .collect(toCollection(ArrayList::new));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then you can add to it after construction:</p>\n<pre><code>strings.add(&quot;baz&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>But again, it's better to just use the <code>Stream</code> directly instead of collecting it to a <code>List</code>.</p>\n<p><sup>*<sub>You probably don't need specifically an <code>ArrayList</code>.
