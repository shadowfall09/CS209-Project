Default serialization of a linked list or a BST would result in a huge loss of space with very little performance gain comparing to just serializing the elements in order.

If the serialized object has immutable fields which need custom serialization, original solution of `writeObject/readObject` is insufficient, as the deserialized object is created *before* reading the part of the stream written in `writeObject`. Take this minimal implementation of a linked list:\r\n \r\n\r\n        public class List&lt;E&gt; extends Serializable {\r\n            public final E head;\r\n            public final List&lt;E&gt; tail;\r\n\r\n            public List(E head, List&lt;E&gt; tail) {\r\n                if (head==null)\r\n                    throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;null as a list element&quot;);\r\n                this.head = head;\r\n                this.tail = tail;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            //methods follow...\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThis structure can be serialized by recursively writing the `head` field of every link, followed by a `null` value. Deserializing such a format becomes however impossible: `readObject` can&#39;t change the values of member fields (now fixed to `null`). Here come\r\nthe `writeReplace`/`readResolve` pair:\r\n\r\n   \r\n    private Object writeReplace() {\r\n        return new Serializable() {\r\n            private transient List&lt;E&gt; contents = List.this;\r\n            \r\n            private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream oos) {\r\n                List&lt;E&gt; list = contents;\r\n                while (list!=null) {\r\n                    oos.writeObject(list.head);\r\n                    list = list.tail;\r\n                }\r\n                oos.writeObject(null);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            private void readObject(ObjectInputStream ois) {\r\n                List&lt;E&gt; tail = null;\r\n                E head = ois.readObject();\r\n                if (head!=null) {\r\n                    readObject(ois); //read the tail and assign it to this.contents\r\n                    this.contents = new List&lt;&gt;(head, this.contents)\r\n                }                     \r\n            }\r\n\r\n\r\n            private Object readResolve() {\r\n                return this.contents;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nI am sorry if the above example doesn&#39;t compile (or work), but hopefully it is sufficient to illustrate my point. If you think this is a very far fetched example please remember that many functional languages run on the JVM and this approach becomes essential in their case.\r\n\r\n2. We may want to actually deserialize an object of a different class than we wrote to the `ObjectOutputStream`. This would be the case with views such as a `java.util.List` list implementation which exposes a slice from a longer `ArrayList`. Obviously, serializing the whole backing list is a bad idea and we should only write the elements from the viewed slice. Why stop at it however and have a useless level of indirection after deserialization? We could simply read the elements from the stream into an `ArrayList` and return it directly instead of wrapping it in our view class.\r\n\r\n3. Alternatively, having a similar delegate class dedicated to serialization may be a design choice. A good example would be reusing our serialization code. For example, if we have a builder class (similar to the StringBuilder for String), we can write a serialization delegate which serializes any collection by writing an empty builder to the stream, followed by collection size and elements returned by the colection&#39;s iterator. Deserialization would involve reading the builder, appending all subsequently read elements, and returning the result of final `build()` from the delegates `readResolve`. In that case we would need to implement the serialization only in the root class of the collection hierarchy, and no additional code would be needed from current or future implementations, provided they implement abstract `iterator()` and `builder()` method (the latter for recreating the collection of the same type - which would be a very useful feature in itself). Another example would be having a class hierarchy which code we don&#39;t fully control - our base class(es) from a third party library could have any number of private fields we know nothing about and which may change from one version to another, breaking our serialized objects. In that case it would be safer to write the data and rebuild the object manually on deserialization.

But, because I don&#39;t find your edit text anywhere in the adapter, I have not added that part. But, the code for that edit text will be like this:\r\n```java\r\nedittext.addTextChangedListener(new TextWatcher() {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onTextChanged(CharSequence s, int start, int before, int count) {\r\n\r\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void beforeTextChanged(CharSequence s, int start, int count, int after) {\r\n\r\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void afterTextChanged(Editable s) {\r\n\r\n        tinyDB.putString(&quot;value&quot;, s.toString());\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nBut, dont forget to change the key in that place according your requirements.","title":"How to save data from RecyclerView EditText","body":"<p>It is not so hard to save data with <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>SharedPreferences</code></a>.

Now, I can give you the entire adapter code with that functionality below:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class ExercisesRecyclerView extends RecyclerView.Adapter&lt;ExercisesRecyclerView.MyViewHolder&gt;\n{\n    String[] data1, data2, videoURL;\n    int[] images;\n    Context context;\n    TinyDBManager tinyDB; // added this line\n\n        public ExercisesRecyclerView(Context ct, String[] s1, String[] s2, String[] videoArray) {\n            context = ct;\n            data1 = s1;\n            data2 = s2;\n            videoURL = videoArray;\n            tinyDB = TinyDB.getInstance(context); // added this line\n        }\n\n    @NonNull\n    @Override\n    public MyViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(@NonNull ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {\n        LayoutInflater inflater = LayoutInflater.from(context);\n        View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.exercises_row, parent, false);\n        return new MyViewHolder(view);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onBindViewHolder(@NonNull MyViewHolder holder, int position) {\n        holder.level.setText(data1[position]);\n        holder.description.setText(data2[position]);\n        holder.playVideoButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\n            @Override\n            public void onClick(View view) {\n                YouTubePlayerView youTubePlayerView;\n                AlertDialog.Builder dialogBuilder;\n                AlertDialog dialog;\n                dialogBuilder = new AlertDialog.Builder(context);\n                LayoutInflater inflater = LayoutInflater.from(context);\n                View view2 = inflater.inflate(R.layout.popup,null);\n                youTubePlayerView = view2.findViewById(R.id.youtube_player_view);\n\n\n                youTubePlayerView.addYouTubePlayerListener(new AbstractYouTubePlayerListener() {\n                    @Override\n                    public void onReady(@NonNull YouTubePlayer youTubePlayer) {\n                        String videoID = videoURL[position];\n                        youTubePlayer.loadVideo(videoID,0);\n                        super.onReady(youTubePlayer);\n                    }\n\n                });\n\n                dialogBuilder.setView(view2);\n                dialog = dialogBuilder.create();\n                dialog.show();\n\n            }\n        });\n\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getItemCount() {\n        return data2.length;\n    }\n\n\n\n\n    public class MyViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder{\n\n            TextView level, description;\n            ImageView playVideoButton;\n\n\n        public MyViewHolder(@NonNull View itemView) {\n            super(itemView);\n            level = itemView.findViewById(R.id.exercisesLevelTextView);\n            description = itemView.findViewById(R.id.exercisesNameTextView);\n            playVideoButton = itemView.findViewById(R.id.playVideoButton);\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>That does the init part for the db. But, because I don't find your edit text anywhere in the adapter, I have not added that part. But, the code for that edit text will be like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>edittext.addTextChangedListener(new TextWatcher() {\n    @Override\n    public void onTextChanged(CharSequence s, int start, int before, int count) {\n\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void beforeTextChanged(CharSequence s, int start, int count, int after) {\n\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void afterTextChanged(Editable s) {\n\n        tinyDB.putString(&quot;value&quot;, s.toString());\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>But, dont forget to change the key in that place according your requirements.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":23732435,"reputation":107,"user_id":17751489,"display_name":"Cuyer"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":381,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":72135804,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1651807230,"creation_date":1651799620,"question_id":72135150,"body_markdown":"I have RecyclerView with multiple EditText.

Apart from the fact that a &quot;wild loop&quot; is just generally a bad idea on its own, Swing is also not thread safe and is single threaded.\r\n\r\nThis means that if this is running within the context of the Event Dispatching Thread, it will block it and prevent from ever been able to process any new events.  If it&#39;s not running in the EDT, you&#39;re risking causing any number of graphic glitches or other &quot;dirty thread&quot; issues.\r\n\r\nAdd into the fact that a &quot;wild loop&quot; like this will also consume the CPU cycles, you&#39;re adding a tremendous performance overhead for little to no gain.\r\n\r\nStart by taking a look at [Concurrency in Swing\r\n](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html)\r\n\r\n`Screen.getInstance().requestFocus(state);` is also a hack around the, known, limitations of `KeyListener` which are better solved through the use the [key bindings API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/keybinding.html)\r\n\r\nTaking all that into account, `Kavaliro` should look
