This can make it &quot;heavy&quot;, in terms of memory usage and difficult when it comes to passing information between panels - as its hard abstract the workflow, not impossible, just problematic.\r\n\r\nOne of the nice features, is till automatically determine the required size of the UI based all the other containers.\r\n\r\nSee [How to Use CardLayout](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/card.html)\r\n\r\n# Custom navigation\r\n\r\nOne of the things I often finding myself needing to do, is have some kind none-linear progression through the UI, and needing the ability to effectively pass information back and forward to different containers.\r\n\r\nThe can be accomplished through the use the [delegation](http://best-practice-software-engineering.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/patterns/delegation.html), [observer pattern](http://best-practice-software-engineering.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/patterns/observer.html) and [dependency injection](http://best-practice-software-engineering.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/patterns/dependency_injection.html).\r\n\r\nThe basic principle here is, you might have a number of navigation controllers, each one managing a particular workflow, independently of all the others.  This kind of separation simplifies the needs of the application and makes it easier to move things around, should the need to be, as any one workflow isn&#39;t coupled to another.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect, which isn&#39;t demonstrated here, is the ability to return information to the navigation controller, for example, if you have a login/register workflow, the workflow could end by returning an instance of the &quot;user&quot; to the controller which would then be able to make determinations about which workflow they needed to go through next (admin/moderator/basic/etc)\r\n\r\n    import

This can make it &quot;heavy&quot;, in terms of memory usage and difficult when it comes to passing information between panels - as its hard abstract the workflow, not impossible, just problematic.</p>\n<p>One of the nice features, is till automatically determine the required size of the UI based all the other containers.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/card.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">How to Use CardLayout</a></p>\n<h1>Custom navigation</h1>\n<p>One of the things I often finding myself needing to do, is have some kind none-linear progression through the UI, and needing the ability to effectively pass information back and forward to different containers.</p>\n<p>The can be accomplished through the use the <a href=\"http://best-practice-software-engineering.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/patterns/delegation.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">delegation</a>, <a href=\"http://best-practice-software-engineering.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/patterns/observer.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">observer pattern</a> and <a href=\"http://best-practice-software-engineering.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/patterns/dependency_injection.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dependency injection</a>.</p>\n<p>The basic principle here is, you might have a number of navigation controllers, each one managing a particular workflow, independently of all the others.  This kind of separation simplifies the needs of the application and makes it easier to move things around, should the need to be, as any one workflow isn't coupled to another.</p>\n<p>Another aspect, which isn't demonstrated here, is the ability to return information to the navigation controller, for example, if you have a login/register workflow, the workflow could end by returning an instance of the &quot;user&quot; to the controller which would then be able to make determinations about which workflow they needed to go through next (admin/moderator/basic/etc)</p>\n<pre><code>import

hmm .. this looks a bit brittle - external code could change the stack without notifying the list (especially, since is a singleton and potential collaborators spread across the world \r\n\r\nYes, it&#39;s true, its buyer beware :-) \r\n\r\nThe alternate proposed solution of implementing Deque with operations directly on a backing observableList is probably preferred, but I&#39;m not going to write that at this time (it would be quite a bit more work to do well).\r\n\r\nThe solution in this answer uses the [FXCollections list wrapper](https://openjfx.io/javadoc/17/javafx.base/javafx/collections/FXCollections.html#observableList(java.util.List)), which, incidentally, on its own is another simple solution to this problem:\r\n\r\n    FXCollections.observableList(ComplexNumberStack.getInstance());\r\n\r\nThough, it has some disadvantages:\r\n\r\n 1. Changes to the underlying stack will not be observed (also true of the solution in this answer).\r\n 2. You need to change the list to observe changes and the list won&#39;t have push/pop ops (unlike the solution in this answer, which does at least provide push/pop ops which will be observed).\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in how the JavaFX framework implementation wrapper works, you can see the code for [ObservableListWrapper](https://github.com/openjdk/jfx/blob/master/modules/javafx.base/src/main/java/com/sun/javafx/collections/ObservableListWrapper.java).  \r\n\r\nIf you wished to, you could copy a version of ObservableListWrapper to your own package (you don&#39;t want to depend on com.sun code directly), then subclass it and adapt it to add your additional push/pop ops (as suggested by kleopatra in comments).\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Deque.html\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZNKRO.png\r\n","title":"Bind java.util.Stack with JavaFX (ListView or TableView)","body":"<p>This example adds a wrapper class around your stack implementation which provides an ObservableList that can be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Placed in a ListView AND</li>\n<li>Respond to bindings (see the pop button disable property binding in the example app).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For it to work, the mutation operations (e.g. push/pop) must be called on the wrapper class rather than the underlying class.</p>\n<p>There are more efficient ways of implementing this (e.g. don't subclass stack, instead implement the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Deque.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Deque</code></a> interface and use an ObservableList directly as storage, extending ObservableListBase).</p>\n<p>However, this is what I came up with that still kept your underlying class and it might be fine or easily adaptable for your purposes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZNKRO.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZNKRO.png\" alt=\"popup\" /></a></p>\n<hr />\n<pre><code>public record ComplexNumber(double real, double imaginary) {}\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<p>The underlying stack implementation is unchanged from the class in your question.</p>\n<pre><code>import java.security.InvalidParameterException;\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class ComplexNumberStack extends Stack&lt;ComplexNumber&gt;

Read the file once and carry out the task as the file is being read.\r\n\r\nThere are oodles of ways to read a file and store or display records in a unique fashion (such as no duplicate titles).

Joop’s Bezier suggestion is likely optimal."},{"owner":{"account_id":2819940,"reputation":12538,"user_id":2423906,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"SedJ601"},"score":0,"creation_date":1638587050,"post_id":70221843,"comment_id":124135191,"body_markdown":"[This](https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/source/chapter6/SimplePaint.java) may be slightly better curve-wise than the answer I posted on the other post you linked.","body":"<a href=\"https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/source/chapter6/SimplePaint.java\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This</a> may be slightly better curve-wise than the answer I posted on the other post you linked."},{"owner":{"account_id":109445,"reputation":3624,"user_id":289995,"accept_rate":85,"display_name":"Manius"},"score":0,"creation_date":1638600581,"post_id":70221843,"comment_id":124136519,"body_markdown":"@James_D I thought I had a &quot;minex&quot; (coining that term right now) basically but I&#39;ll make it a little more copy-paste friendly and complete now.
