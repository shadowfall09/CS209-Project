I would like to achieve something like that (in pseudocode):</p>\n<pre><code>while(condition not met)\nboolean messageSendingSuccess = tryToSendMessage(secondaryAddress);\nif(messageSendingSuccess) return;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In reality I would like to create the whole queue of messages and implement the solution for the whole queue of messages (until the first message is sent - wait. when first message is sent - start trying to send new message etc.), but this is the scenario for one message.</p>\n<p>How can I achieve that? I know that CircuitBreaker will not help me here <a href=\"https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-circuit-breaker/java/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-circuit-breaker/java/</a> because it is trying to reconnect given number of times.

The following</p>\n<pre><code>new TypeToken&lt;ArrayList&lt;Class.forName(MyClass)&gt;&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>is invalid because you're trying to pass a method invocation where a type name is expected.</p>\n<p>The following</p>\n<pre><code>new TypeToken&lt;ArrayList&lt;T&gt;&gt;() \n</code></pre>\n<p>is not possible because of how generics (type erasure) and reflection works. The whole <code>TypeToken</code> hack works because <code>Class#getGenericSuperclass()</code> does the following</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Returns the Type representing the direct superclass of the entity\n(class, interface, primitive type or void) represented by this Class.</p>\n<p>If the superclass is a parameterized type, the Type object returned\nmust accurately reflect the actual type parameters used in the source\ncode.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, if it sees <code>ArrayList&lt;T&gt;</code>, that's the <code>ParameterizedType</code> it will return and you won't be able to extract the compile time value that the type variable <code>T</code> would have had.</p>\n<p><code>Type</code> and <code>ParameterizedType</code> are both interfaces. You can provide an instance of your own implementation (define a class that implements either interface and overrides its methods) or use one of the <a href=\"https://javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/reflect/TypeToken.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">helpful factory methods that <code>TypeToken</code> provides in its latest versions</a>.
