javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRegistry;\r\n\r\nimport com.mycompany.user.impl.UserListImpl;\r\nimport com.mycompany.user.impl.UserTypeImpl;\r\n\r\n@XmlRegistry\r\npublic class ObjectFactory {\r\n\r\n\tpublic ObjectFactory() {\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic UserType createUserType() {\r\n\t\treturn new UserTypeImpl();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic UserList createUserList() {\r\n\t\treturn new UserListImpl();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage com.mycompany.user.impl;\r\n\r\nimport javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRegistry;\r\n\r\n@XmlRegistry\r\npublic class ObjectFactory {\r\n\r\n\tpublic ObjectFactory() {\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic UserTypeImpl createUserType() {\r\n\t\treturn new UserTypeImpl();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic UserListImpl createUserList() {\r\n\t\treturn new UserListImpl();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `com.mycompany.user`, the `jaxb.properties` indicates a user-defined context factory:\r\n\r\n```properties\r\njavax.xml.bind.context.factory=com.mycompany.user.impl.JAXBContextFactory\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe javadoc of the source code explains how the 2 ObjectFactory classes are used to handle interface/implementation model classes :\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/javaee/jaxb-v2/blob/master/jaxb-ri/xjc/src/main/java/com/sun/tools/xjc/runtime/JAXBContextFactory.java\r\n\r\n&gt; This code is only used when XJC generates interfaces/implementations. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The trick to make this work is two ObjectFactory classes that we\r\n&gt; generate in the interface/implementation mode. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The public ObjectFactory follows the spec, and this is the one that&#39;s\r\n&gt; exposed to users. The public ObjectFactory refers to interfaces, so\r\n&gt; they aren&#39;t directly usable by a JAXB 2.0 implementation. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The private one lives in the impl package, and this one is\r\n&gt; indistinguishable from the ObjectFactory that we generate for the value\r\n&gt; class generation mode. This private ObjectFactory refers to\r\n&gt; implementation classes, which are also indistinguishable from value\r\n&gt; classes that JAXB generates. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; All in all, the private ObjectFactory plus implementation classes give\r\n&gt; a JAXB provider an illusion that they are dealing with value classes\r\n&gt; that happens toimplement some interfaces. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; In this way, the JAXB RI can provide the portability even for\r\n&gt; theinterface/implementation generation mode.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand it, the error below suggests that JAXB runtime is unable to guess the proper implementation of the interface as it doesn&#39;t know which one it should use between many possible interfaces.\r\n\r\nBelow the error obtained when running in Eclipse in an isolated project:\r\n\r\n    javax.xml.bind.JAXBException: Provider com.sun.xml.bind.v2.ContextFactory could not be instantiated: com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.IllegalAnnotationsException: 4 counts of

generates interfaces/implementations.</p>\n<p>The trick to make this work is two ObjectFactory classes that we\ngenerate in the interface/implementation mode.</p>\n<p>The public ObjectFactory follows the spec, and this is the one that's\nexposed to users. The public ObjectFactory refers to interfaces, so\nthey aren't directly usable by a JAXB 2.0 implementation.</p>\n<p>The private one lives in the impl package, and this one is\nindistinguishable from the ObjectFactory that we generate for the value\nclass generation mode. This private ObjectFactory refers to\nimplementation classes, which are also indistinguishable from value\nclasses that JAXB generates.</p>\n<p>All in all, the private ObjectFactory plus implementation classes give\na JAXB provider an illusion that they are dealing with value classes\nthat happens toimplement some interfaces.</p>\n<p>In this way, the JAXB RI can provide the portability even for\ntheinterface/implementation generation mode.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as I understand it, the error below suggests that JAXB runtime is unable to guess the proper

However, no such file exists in my folder &quot;z3-4.12.2-x64-win/bin&quot; (which is where the jar I gave to Maven as a dependency for z3 is). The folder does include the files &quot;libz3java.dll&quot;, &quot;libz3java.lib&quot;, should it be included alongside these? Or should one of these be used instead?\r\n\r\nI have attempted to find this file as follows:\r\n\r\n 1. Try the command ```SET | findstr &#39;^LD_LIBRARY_PATH&#39;``` (As a Windows-equivalent of the command in the [previous Stackoverflow-question][1]?). The (translation) of the output is:\r\n\r\n**Cmdlet Set-Variable at the Command-pipeline-position 1**\r\n\r\n**Give values for the following Parameters:**\r\n\r\n**Name[0]:** \r\n\r\nBut this seems to set something instead of print (the path)? I have also tried running the exact command in a Linux-Shell, but then there is no output at all.\r\n\r\n 2. In this other [Stackoverflow-question][2] &quot;libz3java&quot; (I am unsure whether .so or another type is meant) can be found in the z3/build folder. But the z3 version I linked with Maven does not contain a folder named &quot;build&quot;. (I have another version of z3 which does contain a build-folder, but again no libz3java.so.

The one keystore which works has an entry in there for a PrivateKeyEntry where as the one which doesn&#39;t work has a trustedCertEntry. I then changed this code to print out the entry for the &quot;localhost&quot; alias and below is what I got, I&#39;m guessing the issue is that it is a Trusted certificate entry and not a private key entry.

The one keystore which works has an entry in there for a PrivateKeyEntry where as the one which doesn't work has a trustedCertEntry. I then changed this code to print out the entry for the \"localhost\" alias and below is what I got, I'm guessing the issue is that it is a Trusted certificate entry and not a private key entry.

The code for main maps Activity - I&#39;m coding at android studio\r\n\r\nI want to implement like Waze application in which if the user use the directions given by the application, as we know the directions it updates or erase the old polyline as the user is like following directions.\r\n\r\ni know it seems not organize, im sorry. I&#39;m calling getdirection again in StartLocationUpdates() to update the getdirection every time the user moves.\r\n\r\nI have the code on deleting the old polyline if they past 10 meters away something from the prevlocation, if the user past 10meters away something it will remove the old polyline and draw another polyline. But it seems that this code is taking up frames in the main method.\r\n*Sample Error = Skipped 33 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.*\r\nI want it to be smooth as possible on constantly updating the directions as the user use the directions given by the application. I tried AsyncTask, Time interval, handler and runnable in getDirections(). but it seems the method I use provided at the code do the thing I want to show but it is laggy. Can someone help on my code on making it less laggy and creating a smooth direction update or maybe also location update.","title":"How can I achieve a smooth direction update using DirectionsAPI (I&#39;m using Google Maps API for my application)","body":"<pre><code>    private void getPlaceDetails(String placeName) {\n    \n        // List&lt;Place.Field&gt;

The code for main maps Activity - I'm coding at android studio</p>\n<p>I want to implement like Waze application in which if the user use the directions given by the application, as we know the directions it updates or erase the old polyline as the user is like following directions.</p>\n<p>i know it seems not organize, im sorry. I'm calling getdirection again in StartLocationUpdates() to update the getdirection every time the user moves.</p>\n<p>I have the code on deleting the old polyline if they past 10 meters away something from the prevlocation, if the user past 10meters away something it will remove the old polyline and draw another polyline. But it seems that this code is taking up frames in the main method.\n<em>Sample Error = Skipped 33 frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread.</em>\nI want it to be smooth as possible on constantly updating the directions as the user use the directions given by the application. I tried AsyncTask, Time interval, handler and runnable in getDirections(). but it seems the method I use provided at the code do the thing I want to show but it is laggy. Can someone help on my code on making it less laggy and creating a smooth direction update or maybe also location update.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","web-services"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":71739,"reputation":307142,"user_id":207421,"accept_rate":82,"display_name":"user207421"},"score":0,"creation_date":1696206377,"post_id":5975754,"comment_id":136119944,"body_markdown":"Unanswerable without the server logs.","body":"Unanswerable without the server logs."}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":376862,"reputation":538,"user_id":728599,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"Paddy Carroll"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1305192272,"creation_date":1305192272,"answer_id":5975913,"question_id":5975754,"body_markdown":"It is a server error response, presumably on an internal service as the given address doesn&#39;t reside on the internet AFAIK.\r\nYou must get the server logs to establish what it does not like about your request.","title":"Error is java.io.IOException: Server returned HTTP response code: 500 for URL: while invoking weservice","body":"<p>It is a server error response, presumably on an internal service as the given address doesn't reside on the internet AFAIK.\nYou must get the server logs to establish what it does not like about your request.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":21419,"reputation":4927,"user_id":52055,"display_name":"lutzh"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1305192458,"creation_date":1305192458,"answer_id":5975950,"question_id":5975754,"body_markdown":"Since the server sent the response code 500 - internal server error - I think you&#39;ll have to debug it on the server side, not the client side.\r\n\r\nYou should check the output of the server log.\r\n","title":"Error is java.io.IOException: Server returned HTTP response code: 500 for URL: while invoking weservice","body":"<p>Since the server sent the response code 500 - internal server error - I think you'll have to debug it on the server side, not the client side.</p>\n\n<p>You should check the output of the server log.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":746041,"reputation":3,"user_id":734382,"display_name":"vinayak"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":8483,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1696292591,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1696201610,"creation_date":1305191417,"question_id":5975754,"body_markdown":"I am getting this Error is java.io.IOException: Server returned HTTP response code: 500 for URL: exception while invoking the web service url that i have.\r\n\r\nI am calling a .NET based web service through a framework built in java and getting:\r\n\r\nHeaders returned from the server:\r\n\r\n    Content-Length:736\r\n    Content-Type:text/xml;
