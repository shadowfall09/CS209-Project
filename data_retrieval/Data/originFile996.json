If I choose higher, it doesn't go above 50.</p>\n\n<p>Right now we are learning classes in my Java class and I have written most of the decision making algorithm within the class and the objects within my program reference my class called NumberGuesser.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class NumberGuesser \n{\nprivate int userGuess = 50;\nprivate int max = 100;\nprivate int min = 1;\n\n\nNumberGuesser(int lowerBound, int upperBound)\n{\n    max = userGuess;\n\n    /*if(userGuess &gt; max)\n    {\n        max = userGuess;\n    }\n    else if(min &lt; userGuess)\n    {\n        min = userGuess;\n    }*/\n\n    if(userGuess &lt; max)\n    {\n        max = userGuess;\n    }\n    else if(userGuess &gt; max)\n    {\n        min = userGuess;\n    }\n}\n\nvoid lower()\n{\n    userGuess = userGuess / 2;\n}\n\nvoid higher()\n{\n\n    userGuess = ((max - userGuess) / 2) + userGuess;\n}\n\npublic int getCurrentGuess()\n{   \n    return userGuess;\n}\n\nvoid reset()\n{\n\n}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Main driver class</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.util.*;\n\npublic class Assignment7 \n{\npublic static void main(String[] args) \n{\n    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);\n    char guess;\n    int min = 1;\n    int max = 100;\n    NumberGuesser numGuess = new NumberGuesser(min, max);\n\n    System.out.println(\"Please think of a number between 1 and 100\");\n\n    do\n    {\n      System.out.print(\"Is the number \"+numGuess.getCurrentGuess()+\"(h/l/c): \");\n        guess = input.next().charAt(0);\n\n        if(guess == 'h')\n        {\n            numGuess.higher();\n        }\n        else if(guess == 'l')\n        {\n            numGuess.lower();\n        }\n        else if(guess == 'c')\n        {\n            System.out.println(\"Correct!\");\n        }\n    }while(guess != 'c');\n}\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any help would greatly be appreciated guys!

It couldn&#39;t print the variable of neither the base class nor the parent class. But in program 2, we used `super()` with variable `a` while printing its output, and instead of printing the value of variable `a` of the derived class, it printed the value of variable `a` of the base class. So it proves that `super()` is used to call the immediate parent.\r\n\r\nOK, now check out the difference between program 3 and program 4.\r\n\r\n**Program 3**\r\n\r\n    class Base\r\n    {\r\n        int a = 100;\r\n        void Show()\r\n        {\r\n            System.out.println(a);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    class Sup3 extends Base\r\n    {\r\n        int a = 200;\r\n        void Show()\r\n        {\r\n            System.out.println(a);\r\n        }\r\n        public static void Main(String[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            new Sup3().Show();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n&gt;200\r\n\r\nHere the output is 200. When we called `Show()`, the `Show()` function of the derived class was called. But what should we do if we want to call the `Show()` function of the parent class?

A common problem is native memory leaks caused by not closing a `ZipInputStream`/`GZIPInputStream`.\r\n\r\nA typical way that a `ZipInputStream` is opened is by a call to `Class.getResource`/`ClassLoader.getResource` and calling `openConnection().getInputStream()` on the `java.net.URL` instance or by calling `Class.getResourceAsStream`/`ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream`. One must ensure that these streams always get closed.  \r\n\r\nSome commonly used open source libraries have had bugs that leak unclosed `java.util.zip.Inflater` or `java.util.zip.Deflater` instances. For example, Nimbus Jose JWT library has [fixed a related memory leak][2] in 6.5.1 version. Java JWT (jjwt) had [a similar bug that was fixed][3] in 0.10.7 version. The bug pattern in these 2 cases was the fact that calls to `DeflaterOutputStream.close()` and `InflaterInputStream.close()` do not call `Deflater.end()`/`Inflater.end()` when an `Deflater`/`Inflater` instance is provided. In those cases, it&#39;s not enough to check the code for streams being closed. Every `Deflater`/`Inflater` instances created in the code must have handling that `.end()` gets called.\r\n\r\nOne way to check for Zip*Stream leaks is to get a heap dump and search for instances of any class with &quot;zip&quot;, &quot;Inflater&quot; or &quot;Deflater&quot; in the name. This is possible in many heap dump analysis tools such as Yourkit Java Profiler, JProfiler or Eclipse MAT. It&#39;s also worth checking objects in finalization state since in some cases memory is released only after finalization. Checking for classes that might use native libraries is useful. This applies to TLS/ssl libraries too. \r\n\r\nThere is an OSS tool called [leakchecker][1] from Elastic that is a Java Agent that can be used to find the sources of `java.util.zip.Inflater` instances that haven&#39;t been closed (`.end()` not called).\r\n\r\nFor native memory leaks in general (not just for zip library leaks), you can use [jemalloc][4] to debug native memory leaks by enabling malloc sampling profiling by specifying the settings in `MALLOC_CONF` environment variable. Detailed instructions are available in this blog post: http://www.evanjones.ca/java-native-leak-bug.html . [This blog post][5] also has information about using jemalloc to debug a native memory leak in java applications. There&#39;s also [a blog post from Elastic][6] featuring jemalloc and mentioning [leakchecker][1], the tool that Elastic has opensourced to track down problems caused by unclosed zip inflater resources.\r\n\r\nThere is also a blog post about a [native memory leak related to ByteBuffers][7]. [Java 8u102][8] has a special system property `jdk.nio.maxCachedBufferSize` to limit the cache issue described in that blog post. \r\n\r\n```\r\n-Djdk.nio.maxCachedBufferSize=262144\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s also good to always check open file handles to see if the memory leak is caused by a large amount of mmap:ed files. On Linux `lsof` can be used to list open files and open sockets: \r\n```\r\nlsof -Pan -p PID\r\n```\r\nThe report of the memory map of the process could also help investigate native memory leaks\r\n```\r\npmap -x PID\r\n```\r\nFor Java processes running in Docker, it should be possible to execute the lsof or pmap command on the &quot;host&quot;. You can find the PID of the containerized process with this command\r\n```\r\ndocker inspect --format &#39;{{.State.Pid}}&#39; container_id\r\n```\r\nIt&#39;s also useful to get a thread dump (or use jconsole/JMX) to check the number of threads since each thread consumes 1MB of native memory for its stack. A large number of threads would use a lot of memory.\r\n\r\nThere is also [Native Memory Tracking (NMT) in the JVM][9]. That might be useful to check if it&#39;s the JVM itself that is using up the native memory.\r\n\r\nAsyncProfiler can be used to detect the source of native memory allocations. This is explained [in another answer][11]. \r\n\r\nThe [jattach tool][10] can be used also in containerized (docker) environment to trigger threaddumps or heapdumps from the host. It is also able to run jcmd commands which is needed for controlling NMT. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/elastic/leakchecker\r\n  [2]: https://bitbucket.org/connect2id/nimbus-jose-jwt/pull-requests/41/explicitly-call-end-on-deflater-inflater/diff\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt/issues/392\r\n  [4]: http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/\r\n  [5]: https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2015/12/11/using-jemalloc-to-get-to-the-bottom-of-a-memory-leak/\r\n  [6]: https://www.elastic.co/blog/tracking-down-native-memory-leaks-in-elasticsearch\r\n  [7]: http://www.evanjones.ca/java-bytebuffer-leak.html\r\n  [8]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u102-relnotes-3021767.html?printOnly=1\r\n  [9]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/troubleshoot/tooldescr007.html\r\n  [10]: https://github.com/apangin/jattach\r\n  [11]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/53598622","title":"Growing resident memory usage (RSS) of Java Process","body":"<p>It's also possible that there is a native memory leak.

Where the standard Java Bean pattern defines a property `x` of type `T` by two methods \r\n\r\n    public T getX() ; // makes x readable\r\n    public void setX(T x) ; // makes x writable\r\n\r\nthe JavaFX properties pattern adds an additional method\r\n\r\n    public Property&lt;T&gt; xProperty() ; \r\n\r\nwhich gives access to the *observable* property. The contract is that\r\n\r\n    xProperty().get() == getX()\r\n\r\nand that the effects of\r\n\r\n    setX(x) \r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    xProperty().set(x)\r\n\r\nare identical.\r\n\r\nThe additional functionality provided by the property accessor is the ability for clients to bind to or observe the property:\r\n\r\n\r\n    someOtherProperty.bind(xProperty())\r\n    xProperty().addListener(...)\r\n\r\nTypically the pattern is implemented simply as\r\n\r\n    private final ObjectProperty&lt;T&gt; x = new SimpleObjectProperty&lt;&gt;(initialValue);\r\n    public ObjectProperty&lt;T&gt; xProperty() {\r\n        return x ;\r\n    }\r\n    public final T getX() {\r\n        return xProperty().get();\r\n    }\r\n    public final void setX(T value) {\r\n        xProperty().set(value);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s important to note here that the property type is `T`, but the field type is different (it is `ObjectProperty&lt;T&gt;`). As in the Java Bean pattern, the name of the field can also be different to the name of the property.\r\n\r\nLombok is not a good fit for all of this, because it assumes the field name and type both define the property name and type. So using\r\n\r\n    @Getter @Setter\r\n    private ObjectProperty&lt;T&gt; x = new SimpleObjectProperty&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\nwill generate the &quot;wrong&quot; methods:\r\n\r\n    public ObjectProperty&lt;T&gt; getX();\r\n    public void setX(ObjectProperty&lt;T&gt; x);\r\n\r\nNote that you essentially *never* want to replace the `ObjectProperty` itself; to change the property value you should call `set()` on the existing property instance. Calling the `setX(...)` method defined by Lombok will cause any listeners previously registered to fail to be notified of subsequent changes to the data.\r\n\r\nYou *could* do the following:\r\n\r\n    @Getter\r\n    private final ObjectProperty&lt;T&gt; x = new SimpleObjectProperty&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\nand clients could use this perfectly fine; they would have to do \r\n\r\n    getX().get()\r\n\r\nto retrieve the value,\r\n\r\n    getX().set(x)\r\n\r\nto set it, and\r\n\r\n    someProperty.bind(getX())\r\n    getX().addListener(...)\r\n\r\netc. This works, but doesn&#39;t conform to the normal naming pattern.\r\n\r\nFXML expression binding uses reflection and the `Binding` API to bind to properties (and properties of properties), etc.\r\n\r\nThe expression `${controller.model.value}` essentially translates to `Bindings.select(controller, &quot;model&quot;, &quot;value&quot;)`, so\r\n\r\n    &lt;Label fx:id=&quot;label&quot; text=&quot;${controller.model.value}&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\nis equivalent to doing\r\n\r\n    label.textProperty().bind(Bindings.select(this, &quot;model&quot;, &quot;value&quot;));\r\n\r\nin the controller.\r\n\r\n`Bindings.select` in turn uses reflection to identify JavaFX properties to which to bind. In doing this, it *assumes that methods are named according to the JavaFX properties pattern*.

Where the standard Java Bean pattern defines a property <code>x</code> of type <code>T</code> by two methods</p>\n<pre><code>public T getX() ; // makes x readable\npublic void setX(T x) ; // makes x writable\n</code></pre>\n<p>the JavaFX properties pattern adds an additional method</p>\n<pre><code>public Property&lt;T&gt; xProperty() ; \n</code></pre>\n<p>which gives access to the <em>observable</em> property. The contract is that</p>\n<pre><code>xProperty().get() == getX()\n</code></pre>\n<p>and that the effects of</p>\n<pre><code>setX(x) \n</code></pre>\n<p>and</p>\n<pre><code>xProperty().set(x)\n</code></pre>\n<p>are identical.</p>\n<p>The additional functionality provided by the property accessor is the ability for clients to bind to or observe the property:</p>\n<pre><code>someOtherProperty.bind(xProperty())\nxProperty().addListener(...)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Typically the pattern is implemented simply as</p>\n<pre><code>private final ObjectProperty&lt;T&gt; x = new SimpleObjectProperty&lt;&gt;(initialValue);\npublic ObjectProperty&lt;T&gt; xProperty() {\n    return x ;\n}\npublic final T getX() {\n    return xProperty().get();\n}\npublic final void setX(T value) {\n    xProperty().set(value);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It's important to note here that the property type is <code>T</code>, but the field type is different (it is <code>ObjectProperty&lt;T&gt;</code>). As in the Java Bean pattern, the name of the field can also be different to the name of the property.</p>\n<p>Lombok is not a good fit for all of this, because it assumes the field name and type both define the property name and type. So using</p>\n<pre><code>@Getter @Setter\nprivate ObjectProperty&lt;T&gt; x = new SimpleObjectProperty&lt;&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>will generate the &quot;wrong&quot; methods:</p>\n<pre><code>public ObjectProperty&lt;T&gt; getX();\npublic void setX(ObjectProperty&lt;T&gt; x);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that you essentially <em>never</em> want to replace the <code>ObjectProperty</code> itself; to change the property value you should call <code>set()</code> on the existing property instance. Calling the <code>setX(...)</code> method defined by Lombok will cause any listeners previously registered to fail to be notified of subsequent changes to the data.</p>\n<p>You <em>could</em> do the following:</p>\n<pre><code>@Getter\nprivate final ObjectProperty&lt;T&gt; x = new SimpleObjectProperty&lt;&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>and clients could use this perfectly fine; they would have to do</p>\n<pre><code>getX().get()\n</code></pre>\n<p>to retrieve the value,</p>\n<pre><code>getX().set(x)\n</code></pre>\n<p>to set it, and</p>\n<pre><code>someProperty.bind(getX())\ngetX().addListener(...)\n</code></pre>\n<p>etc. This works, but doesn't conform to the normal naming pattern.</p>\n<p>FXML expression binding uses reflection and the <code>Binding</code> API to bind to properties (and properties of properties), etc.</p>\n<p>The expression <code>${controller.model.value}</code> essentially translates to <code>Bindings.select(controller, &quot;model&quot;, &quot;value&quot;)</code>, so</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Label fx:id=&quot;label&quot; text=&quot;${controller.model.value}&quot;/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>is equivalent to doing</p>\n<pre><code>label.textProperty().bind(Bindings.select(this, &quot;model&quot;, &quot;value&quot;));\n</code></pre>\n<p>in the controller.</p>\n<p><code>Bindings.select</code> in turn uses reflection to identify JavaFX properties to which to bind. In doing this, it <em>assumes that methods are named according to the JavaFX properties pattern</em>. Because of this, trying to use FXML expression binding in conjunction with Lombok won't work.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of a complete working application, binding the text of a label to a property in a model, held by the controller.</p>\n<p>hello-view.fxml</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\n\n&lt;?import javafx.scene.control.*?&gt;\n&lt;?import javafx.scene.layout.HBox?&gt;\n&lt;?import javafx.scene.layout.VBox?&gt;\n&lt;VBox alignment=&quot;CENTER&quot; spacing=&quot;20.0&quot; xmlns:fx=&quot;http://javafx.com/fxml&quot;\n      fx:controller=&quot;org.jamesd.examples.binding.HelloController&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;HBox spacing=&quot;5&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;Label text=&quot;Current value:&quot;/&gt;\n        &lt;Label text=&quot;${controller.model.value}&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/HBox&gt;\n    &lt;HBox spacing=&quot;5&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;Label text=&quot;Update value:&quot;/&gt;\n        &lt;TextField fx:id=&quot;newValueTF&quot; onAction=&quot;#updateValue&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/HBox&gt;\n    &lt;Button text=&quot;Reset model&quot; onAction=&quot;#resetModel&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/VBox&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>HelloController.java</p>\n<pre><code>package org.jamesd.examples.binding;\n\nimport javafx.beans.property.ObjectProperty;\nimport javafx.beans.property.SimpleObjectProperty;\nimport javafx.fxml.FXML;\nimport javafx.scene.control.Label;\nimport javafx.scene.control.TextField;\n\npublic class HelloController {\n\n    private ObjectProperty&lt;Model&gt; model = new SimpleObjectProperty&lt;&gt;(new Model());\n\n\n    public Model getModel() {\n        return model.get();\n    }\n\n    public ObjectProperty&lt;Model&gt; modelProperty() {\n        return model;\n    }\n\n    public void setModel(Model model) {\n        this.model.set(model);\n    }\n\n    @FXML\n    private TextField newValueTF ;\n    @FXML\n    private void updateValue() {\n        getModel().setValue(newValueTF.getText());\n    }\n\n    @FXML\n    private void resetModel() {\n        setModel(new Model());\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Model.java</p>\n<pre><code>package org.jamesd.examples.binding;\n\nimport javafx.beans.property.SimpleStringProperty;\nimport javafx.beans.property.StringProperty;\n\npublic class Model {\n    private final StringProperty value = new SimpleStringProperty(&quot;Test&quot;);\n\n    public String getValue() {\n        return value.get();\n    }\n\n    public StringProperty valueProperty() {\n        return value;\n    }\n\n    public void setValue(String value) {\n        this.value.set(value);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>and the application class:</p>\n<pre><code>package org.jamesd.examples.binding;\n\nimport javafx.application.Application;\nimport javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader;\nimport javafx.scene.Scene;\nimport javafx.stage.Stage;\n\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class HelloApplication extends Application {\n    @Override\n    public void start(Stage stage) throws IOException {\n        FXMLLoader fxmlLoader = new FXMLLoader(HelloApplication.class.getResource(&quot;hello-view.fxml&quot;));\n        Scene scene = new Scene(fxmlLoader.load());\n        stage.setTitle(&quot;Hello!&quot;);\n        stage.setScene(scene);\n        stage.show();\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        launch();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note this allows for the binding to persist over replacement of the model instance in the controller.

In WPF/XAML you would just have the following:</p>\n<pre><code>public class Model\n{\n    public string SomeString { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic partial class View ...\n{\n    public Model DataModel { get; set; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the XAML file:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Label Text = &quot;{Binding DataModel.SomeString}&quot; /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>... then set the Model object as data context, done. It's probably not fair to compare both frameworks like this, and this isn't meant to complain and to be like &quot;WPF is so much better bla bla&quot;. Again, just trying to explain where I come from.</p>\n<p>TLDR; should I bite the bullet and go for a ton of boilerplate to have a nice FXML binding or do it the &quot;primitive&quot; way and set GUI contents directly, sparing myself all that additional code?</p>\n<p>As of now, to me personally, it seems it would be more viable to ditch FXML and build the GUI purely in Java as it seems like it would drastically reduce the amount of code, since even if you define your GUI in FXML, you'd probably have to double down on re-defining controls in your controller anyway to have access to them.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","ios","junit","appium"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2744871,"reputation":640,"user_id":2365509,"accept_rate":73,"display_name":"vishal"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1468900435,"creation_date":1458358003,"answer_id":36097469,"question_id":36045790,"body_markdown":"I had the same issue a few months back and tried two solutions for it.\r\n\r\n1) Use a proxy in your code.

            &lt;/execution&gt;\r\n            &lt;/executions&gt;\r\n\r\nbecause if I comment it out, everything packages successfully, but no result is present.\r\nI am new to Maven technology and going through Spring framework beginner to guru course.

The reason is, The specification for a programming language or library may promise that if your multi-threaded program obeys certain rules, then you can expect it to behave in a certain way, but you will practically _never_ find a promise that if your program breaks the rules then it will fail to meet your expectations.\r\n\r\nI personally have seen a software update go through weeks of unit testing and integration testing, and then be shipped out into the field, where it ran for half a year before a piece of &quot;thread unsafe&quot; code caused it to fail at a customer site.\r\n\r\nThe only way to be sure that your multi-threaded program will work, is to _prove_ that (A) it says what you think it says, and (B) it obeys the rules.\r\n\r\nYour example obeys the rules, but I don&#39;t think it does what you think it does.
