In order to achieve that, you would have to explicitly call the method on the bean instance, which is not what you want, because Spring does that for you internally. When debugging, you will also see that `HeartBeat`&#39;s lifecycle method has long since run before the aspect becomes active. You could mark `HeartBeat` as `@Lazy`, then the aspect bean is wired first, but still that does not mean you can intercept the post-construct method with Spring AOP.\r\n\r\nLike I commented before, I see no reason why `@Profile` would not work. For me, it works beautifully. Chances are, that your Spring config needs fixing. You still did not provide any reproducer for your problem.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to intercept the post-construct method with an aspect, you need a more powerful AOP tool than Spring AOP, namely native AspectJ. I tried with load-time weaving, and it works, if configured correctly. The code looks like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage de.scrum_master.spring.q76435875;\r\n\r\nimport java.lang.annotation.ElementType;\r\nimport java.lang.annotation.Retention;\r\nimport java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;\r\nimport java.lang.annotation.Target;\r\n\r\n@Target(ElementType.METHOD)\r\n@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\r\npublic @interface SkipForTestProfile {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage de.scrum_master.spring.q76435875;\r\n\r\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Lazy;\r\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Component;\r\n\r\nimport javax.annotation.PostConstruct;\r\n\r\n@Component\r\n@Lazy\r\npublic class HeartBeat {\r\n  @PostConstruct\r\n  @SkipForTestProfile\r\n  protected void init() {\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Doing health check&quot;);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that you need `@Lazy`, otherwise you cannot inject the `Environment` into the native aspect on time before `HeartBeat.init()` executes.\r\n\r\nWithout `@Lazy`, you have to parse the system property `spring.profiles.active` manually. That is also possible.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage de.scrum_master.spring.q76435875;\r\n\r\nimport org.aspectj.lang.ProceedingJoinPoint;\r\nimport org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Around;\r\nimport org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;\r\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;\r\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Configurable;\r\nimport org.springframework.core.env.Environment;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.Arrays;\r\n\r\n@Aspect\r\n//@Component\r\n@Configurable\r\npublic class SkipForTestProfileAspect {\r\n  @Autowired\r\n  private Environment environment;\r\n\r\n  @Around(&quot;@annotation(skipForTestProfile) &amp;&amp; execution(* *(..))&quot;)\r\n  public Object skipMethodForTestProfile(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint, SkipForTestProfile skipForTestProfile) throws Throwable {\r\n    System.out.println(joinPoint + &quot; -&gt;  test profile &quot; + (isTestProfile() ? &quot;active&quot; : &quot;inactive&quot;));\r\n    return isTestProfile() ? null : joinPoint.proceed();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private boolean isTestProfile() {\r\n    return Arrays.asList(environment.getActiveProfiles()).contains(&quot;it&quot;);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that a native AspectJ aspect should not carry any `@Component` annotation, because it is not a Spring component. You do, however, need `@Configurable` (from `spring-aspects`) to be able to inject the Spring environment.\r\n\r\nAgain, that is unnecessary, if you parse the system property manually.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage de.scrum_master.spring.q76435875;\r\n\r\nimport org.aspectj.lang.Aspects;\r\nimport org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;\r\nimport org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;\r\nimport org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;\r\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;\r\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;\r\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.EnableLoadTimeWeaving;\r\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.aspectj.EnableSpringConfigured;\r\n\r\n@SpringBootApplication\r\n@Configuration\r\n//@EnableAspectJAutoProxy\r\n@EnableLoadTimeWeaving\r\n@EnableSpringConfigured\r\npublic class DemoApplication {\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    try (ConfigurableApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args)) {\r\n      HeartBeat heartBeat = context.getBean(HeartBeat.class);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this driver application, you see that we need `@EnableLoadTimeWeaving` rather than `@EnableAspectJAutoProxy` for native load-time weaving. We also need `@EnableSpringConfigured` in order to auto-wire a Spring bean (the environment) into a non-Spring component (the aspect).\r\n\r\nWe also explicitly instantiate a `HeartBeat` bean in order to see the effect of the aspect.\r\n\r\nNow start the application with JVM parameters (on a single line)\r\n\r\n```none\r\n--add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED\r\n-javaagent:/path/to/aspectjweaver-1.9.19.jar\r\n-javaagent:/path/to/spring-instrument-5.3.16.jar\r\n-Dspring.profiles.active=it\r\n```\r\n\r\nto see log output like\r\n\r\n```none\r\nexecution(void de.scrum_master.spring.q76435875.HeartBeat.init()) -&gt;  test profile active\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the active `it` profile, it says:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nexecution(void de.scrum_master.spring.q76435875.HeartBeat.init()) -&gt;  test profile inactive\r\nDoing health check\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs that really worth the effort? Would it not be better to get `@Profile` and Spring AOP working?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Update:** If you want to work without `@EnableSpringConfigured`, `@Configurable` and `@Lazy`, simply instantiate a `StandardEnvironment` by yourself inside the aspect, and the sitution is simplified as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage de.scrum_master.spring.q76435875;\r\n\r\nimport org.aspectj.lang.ProceedingJoinPoint;\r\nimport org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Around;\r\nimport org.aspectj.lang.annotation.Aspect;\r\nimport org.springframework.core.env.Environment;\r\nimport org.springframework.core.env.StandardEnvironment;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.Arrays;\r\n\r\n@Aspect\r\n//@Component\r\npublic class SkipForTestProfileAspect {\r\n  private Environment environment = new StandardEnvironment();\r\n\r\n  @Around(&quot;@annotation(skipForTestProfile) &amp;&amp; execution(* *(..))&quot;)\r\n  public Object skipMethodForTestProfile(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint, SkipForTestProfile skipForTestProfile) throws Throwable {\r\n    System.out.println(joinPoint + &quot; -&gt;  test profile &quot; + (isTestProfile() ? &quot;active&quot; : &quot;inactive&quot;));\r\n    return isTestProfile() ? null : joinPoint.proceed();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private boolean isTestProfile() {\r\n    return Arrays.asList(environment.getActiveProfiles()).contains(&quot;it&quot;);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage de.scrum_master.spring.q76435875;\r\n\r\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Component;\r\n\r\nimport javax.annotation.PostConstruct;\r\n\r\n@Component\r\npublic class HeartBeat {\r\n  @PostConstruct\r\n  @SkipForTestProfile\r\n  protected void init() {\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Doing health check&quot;);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage de.scrum_master.spring.q76435875;\r\n\r\nimport org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;\r\nimport org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;\r\nimport org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext;\r\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;\r\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.EnableLoadTimeWeaving;\r\n\r\n@SpringBootApplication\r\n@Configuration\r\n//@EnableAspectJAutoProxy\r\n@EnableLoadTimeWeaving\r\npublic class DemoApplication {\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    try (ConfigurableApplicationContext context = SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args)) {\r\n//      HeartBeat heartBeat = context.getBean(HeartBeat.class);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this configuration, it is also no longer necessary to instantiate the `HeartBeat` bean in the application starter in order to see the aspect log, because there is no `@Lazy` bean instantiation anymore.

If you change one petite thing in parent class, you have trouble. What about all the descendants? Did this change affect them?\r\n\r\nAnd also consider testing. Parent class can not be separated, you have to test everything and the tests are complicated and often not made at all, because the effort is just too big to make testing sense.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when you use composition, you can easily separate functionalities, you can use dependency injection, when reading other people&#39;s code, you can focus on smaller piece of functionality. If higher level class, which uses composition needs to replace some minor functionality by other implementation, then it is far easier, because you much better know, what&#39;s going on in the code.

If you change one petite thing in parent class, you have trouble. What about all the descendants? Did this change affect them?</p>\n\n<p>And also consider testing. Parent class can not be separated, you have to test everything and the tests are complicated and often not made at all, because the effort is just too big to make testing sense.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, when you use composition, you can easily separate functionalities, you can use dependency injection, when reading other people's code, you can focus on smaller piece of functionality. If higher level class, which uses composition needs to replace some minor functionality by other implementation, then it is far easier, because you much better know, what's going on in the code.

Hence at any given point of time, `Dog` **will always be** a `Mammal` and a `Snake` **will always be** a `Reptile`. Hence, this **is-a** relationship builds a **strong bond** between two entities. During the course of execution, as long as `Dog` extends `Mammal`, it cannot be a `Reptile` or anything else.\r\n\r\nWhereas coming back to **has-a** relationship (Composition), I can say that a `Person` **has-a** `Car`. I&#39;m not specifying the type of the `Car` that this person has. Let&#39;s get back to OO perspective to understand this better.\r\n\r\nConsider this `Person` class\r\n\r\n    public class Person {\r\n    \tprivate String name;\r\n    \tprivate String address;\r\n    \t\r\n    \tprivate Car car;\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic Person(String name, String address, Car car) {\r\n    \t\tsuper();\r\n    \t\tthis.name = name;\r\n    \t\tthis.address = address;\r\n    \t\tthis.car = car;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \t\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIt can be seen here that, a `Person` has-a name, address and car.\r\nThe code for Car and related classes goes below:\r\n\r\n    public class Car {\r\n    \t//Car related methods\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class Ferrari extends Car{\r\n    \t//Ferrari specific methods, attributes\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class Bmw extends Car{\r\n    \t//BMW specific attributes, methods.\r\n    }\r\nIt can be seen that `BMW` and `Ferrari` are types of `Car`.\r\nNow coming back to the statement **&quot;Person has-a Car&quot;**, the Car could be any Car. It could be a ferrari or BMW or anything else. This can be passed in during creation of `Person` object.\r\n\r\n`Person john = new Person(&quot;John&quot;, &quot;#81, 2nd Street,..&quot;, new Ferrari());`\r\n\r\nIt can be seen that John takes in a `Ferrari` `Car`. Here John can take in any type of `Car` being passed during object creation (dynamic nature).

In your `application.properties` add the following:\r\n\r\n    **Register your app to the Spring Boot Admin Server which is still your app**\r\n\r\n        spring.boot.admin.url=http://localhost:8031\r\n\r\n    **Instruct Spring Boot Admin Server where to find the client**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        // For versions 2.*.*\r\n        spring.boot.admin.client.url=http://localhost:8031\r\n        // For versions 1.*.*\r\n        spring.boot.admin.client.service-url=http://localhost:8031\r\n        spring.boot.admin.client.management-url=http://localhost:8031\r\n        spring.boot.admin.client.health-url=http://localhost:8031/health\r\n\r\n4. In your `logback.xml` just add the following line `&lt;jmxConfigurator/&gt;`. This allows configuration of logback via JMX. More info [here][1]\r\n\r\n... and **voila** you are done. Now you can change the debug level for any logger at runtime.\r\n\r\ni. Just visit the url for your Spring Boot Admin Server-in our case here (`http:/localhost:8031`). \r\n\r\nii. A list of applications (clients) registered will be displayed on the home page. \r\n\r\niii. Click `Details` against the registered clients which will take you to another page. \r\n\r\niv. Click the `Logging` tab which will list all loggers registered in your application. \r\n\r\nv. You can change the log levels it will change your logging level at runtime.

(Below IIRC 18, `String.getBytes()` gives you a JVM-dependent encoding which for an arbitrary string like a real password can vary on different systems or environments, which will cause cryptography using it to fail, but for the example string you show all realistic encodings give the same result.) \r\n\r\nBut even if you did use this factory it wouldn&#39;t be correct because `openssl enc` by default does not use PBKDF2, it uses a function called `EVP_BytesToKey` which is based on but different from PBKDF1. In OpenSSL 1.1.1 up, you can _optionally_ specify `-pbkdf2` (and/or `-iter N`) in `enc`, and if you don&#39;t it gives a warning message about &#39;deprecated key derivation&#39; which you should have noticed, so I assume you&#39;re either using obsolete OpenSSL or trying to prevent us accurately understanding your situation and thus making it unlikely to get a useful answer. \r\n\r\nAlso, with _either_ kind of key derivation (old `EVP_BytesToKey` or optional new PBKDF2) `openssl enc` by default uses salt, which is randomly generated and written in the file when encrypting; when decrypting you must read the salt from the file and use it. Specifically, skip or discard the first 8 bytes (which are the fixed characters `Salted__`) and take the next 8 bytes as salt, then the remainder of the file as ciphertext\r\n\r\nDepending on what you want (or maybe your users/customers/etc want) to do there are three possibilities:\r\n\r\n1. encrypt with `openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -k ...` with the default derivation (as now) and code the Java to read the salt from the file as above, implement `EVP_BytesToKey` using the password and that salt, and use its output for both the key and IV in the Java `Cipher` (for aes-256-cbc generate 48 bytes and use the first 32 bytes as key and the last 16 bytes as IV). `EVP_BytesToKey` uses a hash which defaults to SHA256 for OpenSSL 1.1.0 up and MD5 for lower versions, so you need to know which version did the encryption for this to work, or else you can _specify_ the hash on the `enc` command with `-md $hash`. There have been hundreds of Qs about this going back over a decade; search for `EVP_BytesToKey` to find some of them. \r\n\r\n2. encrypt with `openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -k ...` and code the Java to read the salt from the file as above and _use_ the keyfactory you created to generate 48 bytes of &#39;key&#39; material, which you must actually split into key and IV as above in the Java `Cipher`. \r\n\r\n3. encrypt with `openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -K 64hexits -iv 32hexits` and code the Java to use the corresponding binary key and IV values.\r\n\r\n&gt; In command i didn&#39;t specify neither random IV nor PKCS5Padding \r\n\r\nWhen you use either old or new key derivation in `openssl enc` it _derives_ the IV rather than specifying it separately; only if you use explicit key (`-K` uppercase) do you also specify `-iv`. `openssl enc` always defaults to the padding variously called pkcs5, pkcs7, or pkcs5/7, except when no padding is needed (stream ciphers like RC4 or ChaCha or stream modes like CTR, OFB, CFB). \r\n\r\n---\r\nOkay, you seem to be reading only about half of what I said. Most fundamentally, you still have `openssl enc` without `-pbkdf2` but are trying to decrypt in Java with PBKDF2, which is flat wrong. In addition you are reading the salt but then converting it to hex, which is wrong, the salt from the file is the correct salt, and you are generating a completely bogus random IV, not deriving it as I said.\r\n\r\nTo be concrete, if you (or I) encrypt a file **with -pbkdf2** like\r\n\r\n     openssl enc -aes-cbc-256 -pbkdf2 -k 1234567812345678 \r\n\r\nwhich will only work on OpenSSL 1.1.1 up (since 2018), the following (minimalistic) Java code correctly decrypts it:\r\n\r\n\tstatic void SO73456313OpensslEnc2_Java (String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n\t\t// file pw: decrypt openssl(1.1.1+) enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -k $pw\r\n\t\tbyte[] salt = new byte[8], data = new byte[1024], tmp; \r\n\t\tint keylen = 32, ivlen = 16, cnt;\r\n\t\ttry( InputStream is = new FileInputStream(args[0]) ){\r\n\t\t\tif( is.read(salt) != 8 || !Arrays.equals(salt, &quot;Salted__&quot;.getBytes() )\r\n\t\t\t\t\t|| is.read(salt) != 8 ) throw new Exception(&quot;salt fail&quot;);\r\n\t\t\tbyte[] keyandIV = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance(&quot;PBKDF2withHmacSHA256&quot;) \r\n\t\t\t\t\t.generateSecret( new PBEKeySpec(args[1].toCharArray(), salt, 10000, (keylen+ivlen)*8) \r\n\t\t\t\t\t).getEncoded();\r\n\t\t\tCipher ciph = Cipher.getInstance(&quot;AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding&quot;); \r\n\t\t\tciph.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, new SecretKeySpec(keyandIV,0,keylen,&quot;AES&quot;), \r\n\t\t\t\t\tnew IvParameterSpec(keyandIV,keylen,ivlen));\r\n\t\t\twhile( (cnt = is.read(data)) &gt; 0 ){\r\n\t\t\t\tif( (tmp = ciph.update(data, 0, cnt)) != null ) System.out.write(tmp);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\ttmp = ciph.doFinal(); System.out.write(tmp);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nNote in PBEKeySpec I used itercount=10000 which is the `enc` default. You can use a higher number like 65536, which may be desirable for security (but that part is offtopic here), if you specify it when encrypting like:\r\n\r\n     openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 65536 -k ... \r\n\r\nOTOH if you use the command you posted, which you must on OpenSSL 1.1.0 or lower, then you cannot decrypt using PBKDF2 at all. \r\nFor that case instead see  \r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/11783062/how-to-decrypt-file-in-java-encrypted-with-openssl-command-using-aes  \r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/31947256/how-to-decode-a-string-encoded-with-openssl-aes-128-cbc-using-java  \r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/32508961/java-equivalent-of-an-openssl-aes-cbc-encryption  \r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/72944988/java-aes-decryption-with-keyfile-using-bouncycastle-ssl  \r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/55175864/looking-for-java-implementation-for-decrypting-a-message-encrypted-using-openssl  \r\nand https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41432896/cryptojs-aes-encryption-and-java-aes-decryption (cryptojs is sometimes compatible with OpenSSL, including the case in that Q).\r\nFor background see my detailed explanation at https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/3298/is-there-a-standard-for-openssl-interoperable-aes-encryption/#35614 or the bear&#39;s at \r\nhttps://security.stackexchange.com/questions/29106/openssl-recover-key-and-iv-by-passphrase .\r\n\r\nAnd remember, as noted in at least some of those earlier Qs, the command you posted uses EVP_BytesToKey with SHA256 in 1.1.0 up but MD5 in 1.0.2 and lower, so you need to know which OpenSSL was or will be used.\r\n\r\n","title":"Decrypt file in java that was encrypted with openssl","body":"<p>Your <code>getKeyFromPassword</code> creates a <code>SecretkeyFactory</code> for PBKDF2 (with HmacSHA256) but doesn't use it; instead you use the password as the key, which is wrong -- unless you actually wanted to do openssl enc with a key (<code>-K</code> uppercase and hex which should be 64 hexits/32 bytes for AES-256) and not a password (<code>-k</code> lowercase and any characters or any length).
