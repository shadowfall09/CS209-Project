It is a game where you have 25 rounded buttons that when pressed change color. So and i colored the buttons around the button pressed (max. 4) the same color to make the little puzzle game more difficult to finish. when i want to press another button the color should change back so when the passively color changed button is red then it should change back when it is passively color changed again if you know what i mean.</p>\n<p>Here is my Code (Main Class) because other one is not needed:\n`</p>\n<pre><code>public class Frame extends JFrame {\n\n    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n    \n    public JButton[][] Buttons = new JButton[5][5]; // 5x5 Button Array\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        new Frame();\n    }\n\n    public Frame() {\n\n        initGui();\n    }\n\n    // Checkt ob alle Buttons rot sind\n    public boolean allButtonsAreRed() {\n\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {\n\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 5; j++) {\n\n                if (Buttons[i][j].getForeground() != Color.RED) {\n\n                    return false;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    public void initGui() {\n\n        // Frame Settings\n        setTitle(&quot;25er Puzzle&quot;);\n        setSize(new Dimension(500, 500));\n        setResizable(false);\n        setDefaultCloseOperation(EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n        setLocationRelativeTo(null);\n\n        // Layout für den Frame\n        setLayout(new GridLayout(5, 5, 5, 5));\n\n        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;Aufgabe: Klicken Sie, bis alle Kreise rot sind!&quot;);\n        \n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {\n            \n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; 5; j++) {\n\n                JButton button = new JButton();\n\n                // Button Settings\n                button.setBorderPainted(true);\n                button.setContentAreaFilled(false);\n                button.setOpaque(true);\n                button.setBorder(new RoundedBorder(200));\n                button.setForeground(Color.LIGHT_GRAY);\n\n                // Integer I und J werden an Button übergeben\n                Buttons[i][j] = button;\n\n                // Buttons werden zum Frame geaddet\n                add(Buttons[i][j]);\n                \n                // Mouse Listener für Button Clicks\n                Buttons[i][j].addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {\n\n                    public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {\n\n                        JButton button = (JButton) e.getSource();\n\n                        // Farbe vom Button zu neuer Farbe setzen\n                        Color newColor = (button.getForeground().equals(Color.LIGHT_GRAY)) ?

Languages like Java intended to sandbox the guest program don&#39;t allow `unsafe` code at all.\r\n\r\nVery high level languages like Python don&#39;t even have simple object-representations for numbers, e.g. an integer variable isn&#39;t *just* a 32-bit object, it has type info, and (in Python specifically) can be arbitrary length for large values.  So even if a Python implementation did have inline-asm facilities, it would be a challenge to let you do anything to Python objects, except maybe for NumPy arrays which *are* laid out like C arrays.\r\n\r\n**It&#39;s possible to call native machine-code functions** (e.g. libraries compiled from C, or hand-written asm) from most high-level languages - that&#39;s usually important for writing some kinds of applications.  For example, in Java there&#39;s JNI (Java Native Interface).

However, when I tried to resize the image using `override(width, height)`, it does not do so. Thus, I added `fitCenter()`, which seems to be the key to get the desired size.\r\n\r\nMy problem is when the `Bitmap` is resized the result is quite weird! Everything is good except for images that have small width values. The attached pictures illustrate the difference between using and not using `fitCenter()`.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the code I used for loading via Glide\r\n\r\n    Glide.with(this)\r\n    \t.load(imageUri)\r\n    \t.asBitmap()\r\n    \t.override(newWidth, newHeight)\r\n    \t.fitCenter()\r\n    \t.atMost()\r\n    \t.into(new SimpleTarget&lt;Bitmap&gt;(newWidth, newHeight) {\r\n    \t\t@Override\r\n    \t\tpublic void onResourceReady(Bitmap resource, GlideAnimation&lt;? super Bitmap&gt; glideAnimation) {\r\n    \t\t\tLog.e(TAG, &quot;Loaded Bitmap Size :&quot; + resource.getWidth() + &quot;x&quot; + resource.getHeight());\r\n    \t\t\t/*\r\n    \t\t\t.\r\n    \t\t\t.
