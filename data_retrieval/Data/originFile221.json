It seems you need a &quot;primer&quot; on data structures. Try googling &quot;What data structure should you use&quot;\r\n\r\nTry this link http://www.devx.com/tips/Tip/14639\r\n\r\nFrom the link :\r\n\r\nFollowing are some tips for matching the most commonly used data structures with particular needs.\r\n\r\n1. When to use a Hashtable?\r\n\r\nA hashtable, or similar data structures, are good candidates if the stored data is to be accessed in the form of key-value pairs. For instance, if you were fetching the name of an employee, the result can be returned in the form of a hashtable as a (name, value) pair. However, if you were to return names of multiple employees, returning a hashtable directly would not be a good idea. Remember that the keys have to be unique or your previous value(s) will get overwritten.\r\n\r\n2. When to use a List or Vector?\r\n\r\nThis is a good option when you desire sequential or even random access. Also, if data size is unknown initially, and/or is going to grow dynamically, it would be appropriate to use a List or Vector. For instance, to store the results of a JDBC ResultSet, you can use the java.util.LinkedList. Whereas, if you are looking for a resizable array, use the java.util.ArrayList class.\r\n\r\n3. When to use Arrays?\r\n\r\nNever underestimate arrays. Most of the time, when we have to use a list of objects, we tend to think about using vectors or lists. However, if the size of collection is already known and is not going to change, an array can be considered as the potential data structure. It&#39;s faster to access elements of an array than a vector or a list. That&#39;s obvious, because all you need is an index. There&#39;s no overhead of an additional get method call.\r\n\r\n4.Combinations\r\n\r\nSometimes, it may be best to use a combination of the above approaches. For example, you could use a list of hashtables to suit a particular need.\r\n\r\n4. Set Classes\r\n\r\nAnd from JDK 1.2 onwards, you also have set classes like java.util.TreeSet, which is useful for sorted sets that do not have duplicates. One of the best things about these classes is they all abide by certain interface so that you don&#39;t really have to worry about the specifics. For e.g., take a look at the following code.\r\n \r\n\r\n      // ...\r\n      List list = new ArrayList();\r\n      list.add(","title":"Difference between HashMap and ArrayList in Java?","body":"<p>Not really a Java specific question.

However, there are definitely combinations that will produce the wrong result.  For example, you say Edomex should be from LGA-0001 to PEZ-9999.  However, your pattern\r\n\r\n    Pattern p10 = Pattern.compile(&quot;[l|m|n|p][a-z&amp;&amp;[^ioqf]][a-z][-]\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d\\\\d&quot;);\r\n\r\nwill accept any combination whose first letter is L, M, N, or P, which is fine, but will also accept any combination whose second letter is not F (or I, O, Q).

You _could_ do it, with a pattern like\r\n\r\n    (l[g-z&amp;&amp;[^ioq]]|[mn][a-z&amp;&amp;[^ioq]]|p[a-e])[a-z&amp;&amp;[^ioq]]-\\d\\d\\d\\d\r\n\r\nThe part in parentheses, using `|` characters, means that it can match one of the alternatives.

But this makes things much more complicated than they should be.  The fact is, you should be using string comparisons, not pattern matchers, to accomplish what you&#39;re trying to do.\r\n\r\nYou can do this with just one pattern:\r\n\r\n    Pattern licensePlatePattern = Pattern.compile(&quot;([a-z&amp;&amp;[^ioq]]{3})-\\\\d{4}&quot;);\r\n\r\nA few things to note: The first part matches any three letters that are not I, O, or Q; but that part of the pattern is in parentheses, which creates a _group_ so that we can look at the three letters later.  Note that this also uses `{3}` to mean exactly three of the thing before it (similarly `{4}`).  Also note that I used `-` by itself to match the dash, not `[-]`; you don&#39;t need to use `[]` when matching just one specific character.\r\n\r\nNow:\r\n\r\n    Matcher matcher = licensePlatePattern.matcher(field_val.getText());\r\n    if (matcher.find()) {\r\n        String letters = matcher.group(1);\r\n            // This gets the part of the input that matches the first parenthesized\r\n            // part of the pattern (in this case, the only parenthesized part)\r\n        if (letters.compareTo(&quot;aaa&quot;) &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; letters.compareTo(&quot;afz&quot;) &lt;= 0) then {\r\n            res.setText(&quot; Your State is  Aguascalientes&quot;);\r\n        } else if (letters.compareTo(&quot;aga&quot;) &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; letters.compareTo(&quot;cyz&quot;) &lt;= 0) then {\r\n            res.setText(&quot; Your State is  Baja&quot;);\r\n        } else if (letters.compareTo(&quot;cza&quot;) &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; letters.compareTo(&quot;dez&quot;) &lt;= 0) then {\r\n            res.setText(&quot; Your State is  Baja Sur&quot;);\r\n\r\nand so on.

Launching from an FXML\r\n\r\nWith the first approach we launch the application like we would a JavaFX app (using `Application.launch(Launcher.class);`), completely bypassing Processing&#39;s JavaFX stage creation code.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll have to download a slightly modified *core.jar* for this approach to work, where I&#39;ve changed the visibility of a few members of the `PSurfaceFX` and `PGraphicsFX2D` classes from `Protected` to `Public`. The changes allow us to launch JavaFX from our own `... extends Application` class, while maintaining access to the members that Processing needs to set during the launch to function.\r\n\r\nProcessing 3 crashes in FX2D mode when the JDK in use is above Java 8, so I&#39;ve also made a working version for 8+, since the FXML files usually need at least Java 9 to work.\r\n\r\n - [Download core.jar (Java 8 &amp; below)][1]\r\n - [Download core.jar (Above Java 8)][2]\r\n\r\nThis is the FXML file I am working with in this example:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nWith the modified *core.jar* added to your project&#39;s classpath, override `initSurface()` in your PApplet class with the following snippet. With this code, we bypass the PApplet&#39;s call to `initFrame()` - this is where processing creates its own JavaFX stage, **which we do not want it to do**.\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n\tprotected PSurface initSurface() {\r\n\t\tg = createPrimaryGraphics();\r\n\t\tPSurface genericSurface = g.createSurface();\r\n\t\tPSurfaceFX fxSurface = (PSurfaceFX) genericSurface;\r\n\r\n\t\tfxSurface.sketch = this;\r\n\r\n\t\tLauncher.surface = fxSurface;\r\n\r\n\t\tnew Thread(new Runnable() {\r\n\t\t\tpublic void run() {\r\n\t\t\t\tApplication.launch(Launcher.class);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}).start();\r\n\r\n\t\twhile (fxSurface.stage == null) {\r\n\t\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\t\tThread.sleep(5);\r\n\t\t\t} catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tthis.surface = fxSurface;\r\n\t\treturn fxSurface;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nSet the PApplet&#39;s renderering mode to FX2D like so:\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic void settings() {\r\n\t\tsize(0, 0, FX2D);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\r\nPut the following, or similar, in your Launcher class. In this example, I have manually found the Node that I want to add the canvas object into. There are better, more programmatic, ways of doing this (such as *.lookup()* using the fx:id of the desired node -- this can be defined in the FXML file).
