In the above e.g let's say another <code>User</code> obj exits which wraps <code>authors</code> and it is the <code>root query resolver</code>. Then what happens is UserQueryResolver completes in <code>graphql-exex-1</code> but field resolver will complete in <code>graphql-exec-2</code> or <code>graphql-exec-1</code> which is random. It is fine but if there is better approach in which we can always completes the field resolvers in the root query resolver thread it will be great.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":14231455,"reputation":45,"user_id":10280571,"display_name":"TARA MISHRA"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":361,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1659774681,"creation_date":1659629901,"question_id":73239233,"body_markdown":"GraphqlRootResolver are running in a user defined threadpool.

Otherwise there will be ambiguity for a validator to extract the validation information, and it will produce broken signatures. Also the parallel signing is not supported for enveloping or detached signature types, as the signature is being created on a root level of an XML document.\nAdditionally, when doing an enveloped signature, you need to ensure you are using an XPath expression excluding the current signature only from the XML scope, therefore you shall not use <em><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#enveloped-signature\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#enveloped-signature</a></em> to create parallel signatures.</p>\n<p>Are you able to correctly create a single signature? If the answer is yes, then more likely the signature type you have chosen does not support parallel signing or there is a configuration problem on some step.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":12605095,"reputation":21,"user_id":9166322,"display_name":"Quoc Thanh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":340,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1659732212,"creation_date":1658920058,"question_id":73136836,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying a digital signature to xml file.
