But it&#39;s not a replacement for kotlin coroutines. Coroutines are still the recommended thing to use when dealing with concurrent processes in Kotlin. \r\nTo compare them,\r\n\r\n - Loom can improve the performance applications: it can run multiple virtual threads and it costs less to have blocked virtual threads than to have a regular threads blocked.\r\n-Kotlin coroutines are intrusive because we cannot call suspend functions in normal function, which is not the case of Loom\r\n - Structured concurrency is much more easier with Kotlin coroutines than Loom.\r\n - Interoperability between Kotlin coroutines and reactive programming are more simpler as we can just use flows than the one between loom and reactive programming.\r\n\r\nTo wrap up, we can say that the best thing Loom has to propose is the virtual threads which can inprove performance, while Kotlin coroutines has more to offer. Why not using both of the features together?\r\n\r\nWell, there is a concept introduced by Moskala in his &quot;**Kotlin Coroutines: Deep dive**&quot; book which is interesting. We can use Loom directly in Kotlin coroutines code and have a better performance while keeping structured concurrency and all the cool stuff we get in coroutines. To do that, we use virtual threads to replace `Dispatchers.IO`. Below is an example of code that uses virtual thread.\r\n```\r\nval LoomDispatcher = Executors\r\n  .newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()\r\n  .asCoroutineDispatcher()\r\nval Dispatchers.Loom: CoroutineDispatcher\r\n  get() = LoomDispatcher\r\n\r\nsuspend fun main() = measureTimeMillis {\r\n  coroutineScope {\r\n    repeat(100_000) {\r\n      launch(Dispatchers.Loom) {\r\n        Thread.sleep(1000)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}.let(::println)\r\n```\r\nBecause `Dispatchers.IO` has just 64 threads, the code above will take over 26 minutes, but we can make use of `limitedParallelism` to increase the number of thread and get the chance to execute the code fastly.

Coroutines are still the recommended thing to use when dealing with concurrent processes in Kotlin.\nTo compare them,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Loom can improve the performance applications: it can run multiple virtual threads and it costs less to have blocked virtual threads than to have a regular threads blocked.\n-Kotlin coroutines are intrusive because we cannot call suspend functions in normal function, which is not the case of Loom</li>\n<li>Structured concurrency is much more easier with Kotlin coroutines than Loom.</li>\n<li>Interoperability between Kotlin coroutines and reactive programming are more simpler as we can just use flows than the one between loom and reactive programming.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To wrap up, we can say that the best thing Loom has to propose is the virtual threads which can inprove performance, while Kotlin coroutines has more to offer. Why not using both of the features together?</p>\n<p>Well, there is a concept introduced by Moskala in his &quot;<strong>Kotlin Coroutines: Deep dive</strong>&quot; book which is interesting. We can use Loom directly in Kotlin coroutines code and have a better performance while keeping structured concurrency and all the cool stuff we get in coroutines. To do that, we use virtual threads to replace <code>Dispatchers.IO</code>. Below is an example of code that uses virtual thread.</p>\n<pre><code>val LoomDispatcher = Executors\n  .newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()\n  .asCoroutineDispatcher()\nval Dispatchers.Loom: CoroutineDispatcher\n  get() = LoomDispatcher\n\nsuspend fun main() = measureTimeMillis {\n  coroutineScope {\n    repeat(100_000) {\n      launch(Dispatchers.Loom) {\n        Thread.sleep(1000)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}.let(::println)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Because <code>Dispatchers.IO</code> has just 64 threads, the code above will take over 26 minutes, but we can make use of <code>limitedParallelism</code> to increase the number of thread and get the chance to execute the code fastly. The code using <code>Dispatchers.IO</code> is as follow:</p>\n<pre><code>suspend fun main() = measureTimeMillis {\n  val dispatcher = Dispatchers.IO\n    .limitedParallelism(100_000)\n  coroutineScope {\n    repeat(100_000) {\n      launch(dispatcher) {\n        Thread.sleep(1000)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}.let(::println)\n</code></pre>\n<p>I didn't personnally run the code with virtual threads but it's said in the book that it took a bit more than two seconds to execute (This is amzing knowing that we block each of the 100 000 threads for 1 second), but the second code took around 30s to finish executing.</p>\n<p>I would say the best way to make the code performant and use some cool stuff that coroutines offer, we can use Loom as a substutition for <code>Dispatchers.IO</code> but keep using coroutines, though there is no any kind of recommendations in the documentations.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":11726648,"reputation":19553,"user_id":8583692,"display_name":"Mahozad"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":3072,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":15,"answer_count":3,"score":15,"last_activity_date":1701252720,"creation_date":1694017779,"question_id":77053797,"body_markdown":"How do Java 21 [virtual threads][1] will compare to Kotlin [coroutines][2]?\r\n\r\nWhen coding in Kotlin, is it better to prefer one over the other?\r\n\r\nThis video: [Java 21 new feature: Virtual Threads #RoadTo21](https://youtu.be/5E0LU85EnTI?si=n-OborGbWY4mpZOR) seems to frown upon using virtual threads for non-IO or non-blocking tasks.\r\n\r\nI create coroutines right and left even for CPU-intensive tasks in my Kotlin code.\r\nIs this not alright anymore?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://openjdk.org/jeps/444\r\n  [2]: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html","title":"Java virtual threads vs Kotlin coroutines","body":"<p>How do Java 21 <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/444\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">virtual threads</a> will compare to Kotlin <a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">coroutines</a>?</p>\n<p>When coding in Kotlin, is it better to prefer one over the other?</p>\n<p>This video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5E0LU85EnTI?si=n-OborGbWY4mpZOR\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Java 21 new feature: Virtual Threads #RoadTo21</a> seems to frown upon using virtual threads for non-IO or non-blocking tasks.</p>\n<p>I create coroutines right and left even for CPU-intensive tasks in my Kotlin code.\nIs this not alright anymore?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","sql","hibernate","join","orm"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2075927,"reputation":2068,"user_id":1849276,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Afsun Khammadli"},"score":0,"creation_date":1430678008,"post_id":30016379,"comment_id":48152864,"body_markdown":"You must use hibernate criteria and I can not see orderitem quantity property.","body":"You must use hibernate criteria and I can not see orderitem quantity property."},{"owner":{"display_name":"user4832640"},"score":0,"creation_date":1430678548,"post_id":30016379,"comment_id":48153063,"body_markdown":"@AfsunKhammadli `quantity ` is the same as `QTY` , i correct it.","body":"@AfsunKhammadli <code>quantity </code> is the same as <code>QTY</code> , i correct it."},{"owner":{"account_id":2075927,"reputation":2068,"user_id":1849276,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Afsun Khammadli"},"score":0,"creation_date":1430678723,"post_id":30016379,"comment_id":48153154,"body_markdown":"Your table has no column with named by quantity","body":"Your table has no column with named by quantity"},{"owner":{"account_id":2075927,"reputation":2068,"user_id":1849276,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Afsun Khammadli"},"score":0,"creation_date":1430679022,"post_id":30016379,"comment_id":48153267,"body_markdown":"You did not understood me.Your OrderItem table has no column named by quantity.But in your select statement your wrote orderitem.quantity","body":"You did not understood me.Your OrderItem table has no column named by quantity.But in your select statement your wrote orderitem.quantity"},{"owner":{"display_name":"user4832640"},"score":0,"creation_date":1430679249,"post_id":30016379,"comment_id":48153349,"body_markdown":"@AfsunKhammadli Sorry, i correct it.I forgot it.","body":"@AfsunKhammadli Sorry, i correct it.I forgot it."},{"owner":{"account_id":2075927,"reputation":2068,"user_id":1849276,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Afsun Khammadli"},"score":0,"creation_date":1430679438,"post_id":30016379,"comment_id":48153427,"body_markdown":"Please correct your question.

I have no power over the original xlsx.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","spring-boot","maven","jpa"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":112317,"reputation":93949,"user_id":296328,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"khmarbaise"},"score":0,"creation_date":1701252205,"post_id":77570141,"comment_id":136751534,"body_markdown":"Have you read the upgrade guides from 2.5.X to 2.6.X and from 2.6.x to 2.7.X and from 2.7.X to 3.X https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki","body":"Have you read the upgrade guides from 2.5.X to 2.6.X and from 2.6.x to 2.7.X and from 2.7.X to 3.X <a href=\"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki</a>"}],"owner":{"account_id":5971035,"reputation":3225,"user_id":4693351,"accept_rate":30,"display_name":"Pritam Kadam"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1701252040,"creation_date":1701252040,"question_id":77570141,"body_markdown":"I have update my application&#39;s spring boot version from 2.5.6 to 3.0.11.

Thank you :)</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","exception","controller-advice"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2134379,"reputation":7299,"user_id":1894517,"accept_rate":79,"display_name":"Vinay Prajapati"},"score":0,"creation_date":1574229396,"post_id":58947567,"comment_id":104152548,"body_markdown":"Possible duplicate of [This application has no explicit mapping for /error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31134333/this-application-has-no-explicit-mapping-for-error)","body":"Possible duplicate of <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31134333/this-application-has-no-explicit-mapping-for-error\">This application has no explicit mapping for /error</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":15714286,"reputation":633,"user_id":11338849,"display_name":"Nitin Zadage"},"score":0,"creation_date":1574231883,"post_id":58947567,"comment_id":104153342,"body_markdown":"Where have you defined @Controller?

And, even this sounds harsh, the probably least problem is the Java 17 baseline in this case.\r\n\r\nFocussing on the Spring Data Neo4j and Neo4j-OGM dependency:\r\nThere was a major change in Spring Data Neo4j between version 5 and 6 (happened with Spring Boot 2.4).\r\n\r\nThis change removed all Neo4j-OGM dependencies from Spring Data Neo4j, even more, SDN was completely rewritten and has its own object mapping now.\r\n\r\nHaving said this, I am not sure what exactly is causing the exception your are facing. The Spring Boot autoconfiguration for SDN in the newer versions is not aware of any Neo4j-OGM classes and wouldn&#39;t touch it.\r\nMaybe this does not matter much, let&#39;s solve your problem.\r\n\r\nYou have two options at hand:\r\nEither upgrade to the new Spring Data Neo4j stack or stick with the &quot;classic&quot; combination of older Spring Data Neo4j and Neo4j-OGM.\r\n\r\nThe first one will require, based on you current project, some work.\r\nSome features of Neo4j-OGM are not supported in Spring Data Neo4j anymore, like working relationship-centric.

working in the past, so I believe there may be something wrong with how the Spring Framework is loading classes.\r\nWe are using annotations such as `@Repository`, for example [in this file which is one of the triggers of the error][2].\r\n\r\nThe `UserRepository` class in this link has a constructor which receives an instance (implementation) of `org.neo4j.ogm.session.Session` as an argument.\r\nFor some reason after updating `Java`, `Gradle` and the dependencies, the Spring Framework is no longer able to create an instance of `org.neo4j.ogm.session.Session`, although I don&#39;t know how it did it in the previous versions...\r\n\r\nI usually work with `Maven` but this was done in `Gradle` so I aimed to understand how it was designed to work.\r\nI am not sure which one of these packages may be the cause for headaches:\r\n\r\n    implementation &#39;org.neo4j:neo4j-ogm-core:4.0.8&#39;\r\n    implementation &#39;org.neo4j:neo4j-ogm-bolt-driver:4.0.8&#39;\r\n

Hexagonal grid is a bit tricky (especially if you a rookie) I suggest you start with square grid instead. That means you need to be able to **load/save** map of your world. And of coarse visualize it somewhere.  Later you can add panning editing etc but that is not important for now. For example look at this:\r\n\r\n- [Improving performance of click detection on a staggered column isometric grid](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35917976/2521214)\r\n\r\n You can find there early version of mine very simple isometric engine in **C++**.\r\n\r\n2. **Terrain generator**\r\n\r\n You need to divide the generation of map into few separate steps.\r\n\r\n 1. **Height map generator**\r\n\r\n     Create pseudo-random 2D height map (with the same x,y resolution as your isometric map) that you will later turn into your isometric map. I suggest you use [Diamond-square algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm). Also have a look at:\r\n\r\n - [Diamond-square algorithm not working](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36258843/2521214)\r\n\r\n     Where you can find mine **C++** implementation.\r\n\r\n 2. **Convert height map into isometric terrain map**\r\n\r\n     Simply rescale the `Z` range of the height map into your max supported height of your isometric map. Then clear your isometric map. And lastly all cells `cell(x,y,0)...cell(x,y,height(x,y))` fill with terrain cubes. This will result in a pseudo random map but done only with cubes (sharp voxel-ated edges). So this needs further filtering.\r\n\r\n 3. **Filter out small holes**\r\n\r\n     This depends on what shapes are supported by your tiles. if you can not smooth edges on small holes with them then fill them with cubes before applying smoothing.\r\n\r\n 4. **Smooth edges**\r\n\r\n     Find specific slope of the terrain and fill it with edged tile.\r\n\r\n Here example of partially smoothed pseudo-random terrain generated in this way:\r\n\r\n [![example][1]][1]\r\n\r\n I left the border cells of map un-smoothed so you see what I mean by smoothing and voxel-ated output.\r\n\r\n3. **Map generator**\r\n\r\n   Now when you have terrain you can add another features. like changing surface tiles to different materials, adding watter, buildings, roads, trees, grass,... Just do a loop where you randomly obtain `x,y` position and feature type, then set it on top of terrain ... To make it more realistic you need to use some rules like watter,sand,grass,rocks,snow are height dependent, buildings can be placed only on flat area, etc.\r\n\r\n   Here example of [applying such rules to terrain](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36647622/2521214)\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/zvs6N.jpg","title":"How to procedurlly generate a Zelda like make in java","body":"<ol>\n<li><strong>Isometric engine</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>First of all you need to have functional isometric engine.

Are there additional Java options or configurations that need to be considered to make the UI scaling consistent across monitors with different scaling factors?</p>\n<p><strong>Current Approach:</strong>\nI am currently using the following Java option for UI scaling:</p>\n<pre><code>-J-Dsun.java2d.uiScale=2\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>However, this does not seem to take into account the individual scaling factors of each monitor.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Environment:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>JDK 17</li>\n<li>Windows 10</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any insights or suggestions on how to achieve consistent UI scaling across multiple monitors with different scaling factors would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","weblogic12c"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":4007082,"reputation":23327,"user_id":3301492,"display_name":"Boris"},"score":0,"creation_date":1579627010,"post_id":59846120,"comment_id":105826226,"body_markdown":"What&#39;s the Spring Boot version?","body":"What&#39;s the Spring Boot version?"},{"owner":{"account_id":17245852,"reputation":31,"user_id":12487164,"display_name":"Aldo Masciantonio"},"score":0,"creation_date":1579627107,"post_id":59846120,"comment_id":105826286,"body_markdown":"Spring Boot 2.0, jdk 1.8","body":"Spring Boot 2.0, jdk 1.8"},{"owner":{"account_id":4007082,"reputation":23327,"user_id":3301492,"display_name":"Boris"},"score":0,"creation_date":1579627333,"post_id":59846120,"comment_id":105826402,"body_markdown":"Does your servlet initializer implement `WebApplicationInitializer` as per [documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-weblogic)?","body":"Does your servlet initializer implement <code>WebApplicationInitializer</code> as per <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-weblogic\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">documentation</a>?"},{"owner":{"account_id":17245852,"reputation":31,"user_id":12487164,"display_name":"Aldo Masciantonio"},"score":0,"creation_date":1579627482,"post_id":59846120,"comment_id":105826488,"body_markdown":"no, my servlet inizializer extends `SpringBootServletInitializer`","body":"no, my servlet inizializer extends <code>SpringBootServletInitializer</code>"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":353069,"reputation":7200,"user_id":690553,"accept_rate":76,"display_name":"Amir Pashazadeh"},"score":0,"creation_date":1641369790,"post_id":59927372,"comment_id":124784207,"body_markdown":"how did you find this? where can I find a compatibility matrix?","body":"how did you find this? where can I find a compatibility matrix?"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":17245852,"reputation":31,"user_id":12487164,"display_name":"Aldo Masciantonio"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1580113612,"creation_date":1580113612,"answer_id":59927372,"question_id":59846120,"body_markdown":"The problem was the version of weblogic server(12.1.3), it doesn&#39;t support spring boot 2.2.4.

Or is there any easier, holistic solution that covers all my request endpoints?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","pdf","ms-word","apache-poi"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":5953740,"reputation":6324,"user_id":4681060,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"Krzysztof Cichocki"},"score":0,"creation_date":1491984525,"post_id":43363624,"comment_id":73789256,"body_markdown":"Possible duplicate of [How to convert MS doc to pdf](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3022376/how-to-convert-ms-doc-to-pdf)","body":"Possible duplicate of <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3022376/how-to-convert-ms-doc-to-pdf\">How to convert MS doc to pdf</a>"},{"owner":{"display_name":"user1999397"},"score":0,"creation_date":1491984639,"post_id":43363624,"comment_id":73789346,"body_markdown":"@KrzysztofCichocki may be , but i did not get help from that question though.","body":"@KrzysztofCichocki may be , but i did not get help from that question though."},{"owner":{"account_id":5953740,"reputation":6324,"user_id":4681060,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"Krzysztof Cichocki"},"score":1,"creation_date":1491984791,"post_id":43363624,"comment_id":73789459,"body_markdown":"here is also another answer if you insist on ApachePOI: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6201736/javausing-apache-poi-how-to-convert-ms-word-file-to-pdf","body":"here is also another answer if you insist on ApachePOI: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6201736/javausing-apache-poi-how-to-convert-ms-word-file-to-pdf\" title=\"javausing apache poi how to convert ms word file to pdf\">stackoverflow.com/questions/6201736/&hellip;</a>"},{"owner":{"display_name":"user1999397"},"score":0,"creation_date":1491988286,"post_id":43363624,"comment_id":73792024,"body_markdown":"@KrzysztofCichocki i am getting The supplied data appears to be in the Office 2007+ XML.

So I guess its failing there.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the call to this function should be available only in case of a Web Start and not for the standalone applications.\r\n\r\n","title":"NullPointerException while connecting through HTTPUrlConnection with JavaUpdate 51","body":"<p>My Java version is:</p>\n<p>java version &quot;1.7.0_51&quot;<br />\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_51-b13)<br />\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.51-b03, mixed mode)</p>\n<p>I have a server/device having untrusted certificate.

You&#39;d have to re-write the code &#129320;.\r\n\r\n    public static class MenuPane extends JPanel {\r\n        private JComboBox comboBox;\r\n\r\n        public MenuPane() {\r\n            this.setLayout(new GridBagLayout());\r\n            comboBox = new JComboBox(\r\n                    new String[] {\r\n                        &quot;Addition of 2 numbers in a GUI&quot;,\r\n                        &quot;Human Constructor in a GUI&quot;,\r\n                        &quot;Roll a dice in a GUI&quot;,\r\n                        &quot;Play a song&quot;,\r\n                        &quot;Window launcher&quot;,\r\n                        &quot;Enter JOptionPane&quot;\r\n                    });\r\n\r\n            // This will default the combobox&#39;s selected value to be\r\n            // empty\r\n            comboBox.setSelectedIndex(-1);\r\n\r\n            add(comboBox);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public int getSelectedValue() {\r\n            return comboBox.getSelectedIndex();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public static int showMenuOptions() {\r\n            MenuDialog menuDialog = new MenuDialog();\r\n            return menuDialog.show();\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        protected static class MenuDialog {\r\n            private int selectedOption = -1;\r\n            private JDialog dialog;\r\n\r\n            public MenuDialog() {\r\n                dialog = new JDialog();\r\n                dialog.setModal(true);\r\n\r\n                MenuPane menuPane = new MenuPane();\r\n                dialog.add(menuPane);\r\n\r\n                JButton okButton = new JButton(&quot;Ok&quot;);\r\n                JButton cancelButton = new JButton(&quot;Cancel&quot;);\r\n\r\n                JPanel actionsPane = new JPanel(new GridBagLayout());\r\n                actionsPane.add(okButton);\r\n                actionsPane.add(cancelButton);\r\n\r\n                dialog.add(actionsPane, BorderLayout.SOUTH);\r\n\r\n                okButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {\r\n                    @Override\r\n                    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\r\n                        selectedOption = menuPane.getSelectedValue();\r\n                        dialog.dispose();\r\n                    }\r\n                });\r\n                cancelButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {\r\n                    @Override\r\n                    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\r\n                        dialog.dispose();\r\n                    }\r\n                });\r\n\r\n                dialog.pack();\r\n                dialog.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            public int getSelectedOption() {\r\n                return selectedOption;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            public int show() {\r\n                dialog.setVisible(true);\r\n                return getSelectedOption();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis class has a nice `static` helper called `showMenuOptions` which will display a modal dialog to the user and return the user&#39;s selected options.\r\n\r\nYou could use this something like...\r\n\r\n    int selectedOption = MenuPane.showMenuOptions();\r\n    System.out.println(selectedOption);\r\n\r\nThis would present the options to the user, allow them to select an option and when they click `Ok`, return the selection index to you - just remember, this would be zero index now &#128521;.\r\n\r\nNow, that&#39;s a lot of work for, arguably, little gain.  You could, instead, just do something like...\r\n\r\n    String option = (String) JOptionPane.showInputDialog(\r\n            null, \r\n            &quot;Make a selection&quot;, \r\n            &quot;Options&quot;, \r\n            JOptionPane.PLAIN_MESSAGE, \r\n            null, \r\n            new String[] {\r\n                    &quot;Addition of 2 numbers in a GUI&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;Human Constructor in a GUI&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;Roll a dice in a GUI&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;Play a song&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;Window launcher&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;Enter JOptionPane&quot;\r\n                }, \r\n            null\r\n    );\r\n    System.out.println(option);\r\n\r\nThis would return `String` of the selected value, which might not be that useful (or more difficult to manage).\r\n\r\nI might be tempted to, instead, create a &quot;menu option&quot; class which had a easy to compare id and a description...\r\n\r\n    public class MenuOption {\r\n        private int value;\r\n        private String description;\r\n\r\n        public MenuOption(int value, String description) {\r\n            this.value = value;\r\n            this.description = description;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public int getValue() {\r\n            return value;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public String toString() {\r\n            return description;\r\n        }        \r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd then use it something like...\r\n\r\n    MenuOption option = (MenuOption) JOptionPane.showInputDialog(\r\n            null, \r\n            &quot;Make a selection&quot;, \r\n            &quot;Options&quot;, \r\n            JOptionPane.PLAIN_MESSAGE, \r\n            null, \r\n            new MenuOption[] {\r\n                    new MenuOption(1, &quot;Addition of 2 numbers in a GUI&quot;),\r\n                    new MenuOption(2, &quot;Human Constructor in a GUI&quot;),\r\n                    new MenuOption(3, &quot;Roll a dice in a GUI&quot;),\r\n                    new MenuOption(4, &quot;Play a song&quot;),\r\n                    new MenuOption(5, &quot;Window launcher&quot;),\r\n                    new MenuOption(6, &quot;Enter JOptionPane&quot;)\r\n                }, \r\n            null\r\n    );\r\n    System.out.println(option.getValue());\r\n\r\nThis would allow you to compare the option&#39;s `value` instead, which is an `int`.\r\n\r\nYou could also expand the concept back to the `MenuPane`, seeding the `MenuOption`s via the constructor and returning the selected `MenuOption` instead of an `int`.\r\n\r\nYou could then expand `MenuOption` concept to included a `execute` method which would actually perform the actions for the option and have a self contained unit of work, no need for `if-else if` statements at all - but&#39;s a whole other topic &#128521;\r\n\r\n# Runnable

You'd have to re-write the code 🤨.</p>\n<pre><code>public static class MenuPane extends JPanel {\n    private JComboBox comboBox;\n\n    public MenuPane() {\n        this.setLayout(new GridBagLayout());\n        comboBox = new JComboBox(\n                new String[] {\n                    &quot;Addition of 2 numbers in a GUI&quot;,\n                    &quot;Human Constructor in a GUI&quot;,\n                    &quot;Roll a dice in a GUI&quot;,\n                    &quot;Play a song&quot;,\n                    &quot;Window launcher&quot;,\n                    &quot;Enter JOptionPane&quot;\n                });\n\n        // This will default the combobox's selected value to be\n        // empty\n        comboBox.setSelectedIndex(-1);\n\n        add(comboBox);\n    }\n\n    public int getSelectedValue() {\n        return comboBox.getSelectedIndex();\n    }\n\n    public static int showMenuOptions() {\n        MenuDialog menuDialog = new MenuDialog();\n        return menuDialog.show();\n\n    }\n\n    protected static class MenuDialog {\n        private int selectedOption = -1;\n        private JDialog dialog;\n\n        public MenuDialog() {\n            dialog = new JDialog();\n            dialog.setModal(true);\n\n            MenuPane menuPane = new MenuPane();\n            dialog.add(menuPane);\n\n            JButton okButton = new JButton(&quot;Ok&quot;);\n            JButton cancelButton = new JButton(&quot;Cancel&quot;);\n\n            JPanel actionsPane = new JPanel(new GridBagLayout());\n            actionsPane.add(okButton);\n            actionsPane.add(cancelButton);\n\n            dialog.add(actionsPane, BorderLayout.SOUTH);\n\n            okButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {\n                @Override\n                public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n                    selectedOption = menuPane.getSelectedValue();\n                    dialog.dispose();\n                }\n            });\n            cancelButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {\n                @Override\n                public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n                    dialog.dispose();\n                }\n            });\n\n            dialog.pack();\n            dialog.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\n        }\n\n        public int getSelectedOption() {\n            return selectedOption;\n        }\n\n        public int show() {\n            dialog.setVisible(true);\n            return getSelectedOption();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This class has a nice <code>static</code> helper called <code>showMenuOptions</code> which will display a modal dialog to the user and return the user's selected options.</p>\n<p>You could use this something like...</p>\n<pre><code>int selectedOption = MenuPane.showMenuOptions();\nSystem.out.println(selectedOption);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would present the options to the user, allow them to select an option and when they click <code>Ok</code>, return the selection index to you - just remember, this would be zero index now 😉.</p>\n<p>Now, that's a lot of work for, arguably, little gain.  You could, instead, just do something like...</p>\n<pre><code>String option = (String) JOptionPane.showInputDialog(\n        null, \n        &quot;Make a selection&quot;, \n        &quot;Options&quot;, \n        JOptionPane.PLAIN_MESSAGE, \n        null, \n        new String[] {\n                &quot;Addition of 2 numbers in a GUI&quot;,\n                &quot;Human Constructor in a GUI&quot;,\n                &quot;Roll a dice in a GUI&quot;,\n                &quot;Play a song&quot;,\n                &quot;Window launcher&quot;,\n                &quot;Enter JOptionPane&quot;\n            }, \n        null\n);\nSystem.out.println(option);\n</code></pre>\n<p>This would return <code>String</code> of the selected value, which might not be that useful (or more difficult to manage).</p>\n<p>I might be tempted to, instead, create a &quot;menu option&quot; class which had a easy to compare id and a description...</p>\n<pre><code>public class MenuOption {\n    private int value;\n    private String description;\n\n    public MenuOption(int value, String description) {\n        this.value = value;\n        this.description = description;\n    }\n\n    public int getValue() {\n        return value;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return description;\n    }        \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then use it something like...</p>\n<pre><code>MenuOption option = (MenuOption) JOptionPane.showInputDialog(\n        null, \n        &quot;Make a selection&quot;, \n        &quot;Options&quot;, \n        JOptionPane.PLAIN_MESSAGE, \n        null, \n        new MenuOption[] {\n                new MenuOption(1, &quot;Addition of 2 numbers in a GUI&quot;),\n                new MenuOption(2, &quot;Human Constructor in a GUI&quot;),\n                new MenuOption(3, &quot;Roll a dice in a GUI&quot;),\n                new MenuOption(4, &quot;Play a song&quot;),\n                new MenuOption(5,

allow you to compare the option's <code>value</code> instead, which is an <code>int</code>.</p>\n<p>You could also expand the concept back to the <code>MenuPane</code>, seeding the <code>MenuOption</code>s via the constructor and returning the selected <code>MenuOption</code> instead of an <code>int</code>.</p>\n<p>You could then expand <code>MenuOption</code> concept to included a <code>execute</code> method which would actually perform the actions for the option and have a self contained unit of work, no need for <code>if-else if</code> statements at all - but's a whole other topic 😉</p>\n<h1>Runnable example...</h1>\n<pre><code>import java.awt.BorderLayout;\nimport java.awt.GridBagLayout;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionEvent;\nimport
