Is there a way to allow for this in JIB, from looking at the source code of the JIB plugin it seems it coded to expect the [output of the Jar task][2].

The binaries are glibc based, so while they are compatible with Debian, they are not Alpine Linux compatible.\r\n\r\n**Background:**\r\n\r\nUntil May 2019, OpenJDK had both Debian and Alpine images, using the packaged OpenJDK versions and installed through the distribution package managers, `apt` for Debian,  `apk` for Alpine. The Debian and Alpine packages are built and maintained by the community, and are such are not verified to the extent of commercial enterprise OpenJDK builds - for example, they are usually not [JCK][1] certified.\r\n\r\nThen, there has been an incident in which a Debian packaged OpenJDK 8 pre-release build has found its way into the official OpenJDK 8 docker image. The issue was initially reported in this thread:  \r\nhttps://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk8u-dev/2019-May/009330.html\r\n\r\nAfter that, it was decided that OpenJDK images will only use official, JCK tested builds, to have one &quot;source of truth&quot;. This decision affected both Debian and Alpine images.\r\n\r\n**Alpine OpenJDK support:**\r\n\r\nThe OpenJDK project does not have official support for Alpine Linux, yet. Alpine Linux builds upon [musl libc][4], which is a minimal and strict POSIX implementation, and is generally not compatible with the standard [glibc][5]. OpenJDK porting for musl libc is under development under OpenJDK&#39;s project [Portola][6].\r\n\r\nAlpine Linux [`openjdk8`][7] packages are provided by [IcedTea][8]. The IceaTea project provides builds for OpenJDK 6, 7 and 8, and was started back when OpenJDK was not fully open sourced yet. These builds are community made, and are not official OpenJDK builds. Moreover, the Alpine Linux OpenJDK 8 IcedTea builds are built from source by Alpine maintainers. Therefore, these builds cannot be considered as production ready, certified builds of OpenJDK.\r\n\r\nMoving away from Alpine images had a large impact on the Alpine Java ecosystem; many projects have moved their images away from Alpine since, which is unfortunate.

The binaries are glibc based, so while they are compatible with Debian, they are not Alpine Linux compatible.</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>\n<p>Until May 2019, OpenJDK had both Debian and Alpine images, using the packaged OpenJDK versions and installed through the distribution package managers, <code>apt</code> for Debian,  <code>apk</code> for Alpine. The Debian and Alpine packages are built and maintained by the community, and are such are not verified to the extent of commercial enterprise OpenJDK builds - for example, they are usually not <a href=\"https://openjdk.java.net/groups/conformance/JckAccess/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JCK</a> certified.</p>\n<p>Then, there has been an incident in which a Debian packaged OpenJDK 8 pre-release build has found its way into the official OpenJDK 8 docker image. The issue was initially reported in this thread:<br />\n<a href=\"https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk8u-dev/2019-May/009330.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk8u-dev/2019-May/009330.html</a></p>\n<p>After that, it was decided that OpenJDK images will only use official, JCK tested builds, to have one &quot;source of truth&quot;. This decision affected both Debian and Alpine images.</p>\n<p><strong>Alpine OpenJDK support:</strong></p>\n<p>The OpenJDK project does not have official support for Alpine Linux, yet. Alpine Linux builds upon <a href=\"https://www.musl-libc.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">musl libc</a>, which is a minimal and strict POSIX implementation, and is generally not compatible with the standard <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">glibc</a>.

Creating the SQL string by mixing a template or a bunch of string constants together with a bunch of user input is a security leak. For example, if you try to make `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = &#39;foo@bar.com&#39;` by e.g. `String sql = &quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = &#39;&quot; + email + &quot;&#39;&quot;;`, the problem is, what if the user puts in the web form, in the &#39;email&#39; field: `whatever@foo.com&#39;; DROP TABLE users CASCADE; EXEC &#39;FORMAT C: /y /force&#39;; --`? Then the SQL becomes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE email = &#39;whatever@foo.com&#39;; DROP TABLE users CASCADE; EXEC &#39;FORMAT C: /y /force&#39;; --&#39;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is legal SQL and you really, really, _really_ don&#39;t want your DB engine to execute it.\r\n\r\nEach DB engine has its own ideas on what&#39;s actually legal, and may do crazy things such as treating curly quotes as real quotes, etc. So, there is no feasible blacklist or whitelist technology you can think of that will properly cover all the bases: You need to ask your DB engine to do this for you, you can&#39;t fix this hole yourself.\r\n\r\nJava supports this, via `java.sql.PreparedStatement`. You instead _always_ pass a fully constant SQL string to the engine, and then fill in the blanks, so to speak:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement(&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?&quot;);\r\nps.setString(1, &quot;foo@whatever.com&quot;);\r\nps.query();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s how you do it (and add try-with-resources just like you should already be doing here; statements and resultsets are resources you must always close). Even if you call `.setString(1, &quot;foo@whatever.com&#39;; DROP TABLE users CASCADE; --&quot;)`, then it&#39;ll simply look for a row in the database that has that mouthful in the `email` field. It will not delete the entire users table. Security hole eliminated (and this is the only feasible way to eliminate it).\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, check out that code. Is it using preparedstatement? In that case, well, one way or another that code needs to be calling:\r\n\r\n```\r\nps.setInt(1, 999);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `ps` is the `PreparedStatement` object created with `connection.prepareStatement(...)` where `...` is either an SQL constant or at least your input string where the `&lt;&lt;empid&gt;&gt;` was replaced with a question mark and __never__ with any string input from an untrusted source. The `1` in `ps.setInt(1, 999)` is the position of the question mark (1 = the first question becomes 999), and the `999` is your actual number. It may look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (input instanceof String) {\r\n    ps.setString(idx++, (String) input);\r\n} else if (input instanceof Integer) {\r\n    ps.setInt(idx++, ((Integer) input).intValue());\r\n} ...\r\n```\r\n\r\netcetera. If you don&#39;t see that, find the `setInt` invoke and figure out how to get there. If you don&#39;t see any `setInt`, then what you want is not possible without making some updates to this code.\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t even see `PreparedStatement` anywhere in the code, __oh dear! Take that server offline right now__, research if a security leak has occurred, if this server stored european data you have 72 hours to notify all users if it has or you can&#39;t reasonably figure out e.g. by inspecting logs that it hasn&#39;t, or you&#39;re in breach of the GDPR.

While the version numbering was similar, this was largely a &quot;marketing thing&quot;.  Certainly the SE and EE release cycles were not the same.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Oracle has passed control of Java EE over to the Eclipse Foundation; see [Jakarta EE 8: The new era of Java EE explained](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/09/12/jakarta-ee-8-the-new-era-of-java-ee-explained/)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n&gt; I was reading that java ee&#39;s own functions would appear as deprecated. \r\n\r\nIf someone actually wrote that Java EE is dead or &quot;deprecated&quot;, they are incorrect.  (Or at least, they are out of date.) \r\n  \r\n  1.  Java EE has now become Jakarta EE, and Jakarta EE has a clear future (see link above)\r\n  2.  Even if it didn&#39;t have a clear future, that wouldn&#39;t amount to deprecation.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n&gt; Do you know how to solve this problem?\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t think there is a problem to solve.\r\n\r\nThe reality is that Oracle had lost interest in Java EE&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and progress  under Oracle&#39;s stewardship had ground to a virtual halt.  Jakarta EE is effectively a reboot.\r\n\r\nWhile predicting the future is difficult, there are reasons to believe that both Java/Jakata EE vendors and Java EE/Jakata users will be better of with the new model.  The first test will be the upcoming Jakarta EE 9 release which is scheduled for August / September 2020.  (Check the [Jakarta EE 9 home page][1] for the latest news on the schedule.)  \r\n\r\nThis Eclipse newsletter from last year gives a taster of what should be in the release:\r\n\r\n  - [Jakarta EE 9 - 2019 Outlook](https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2019/february/Jakarta_EE_9.php)\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1 - Java EE / Jakarta EE is essentially a set of specifications.  Writing and maintaining high quality specifications is expensive.  Since Oracle didn&#39;t have any significant (money making) Java EE products, Oracle management decided that it was not worth continuing to invest in that aspect of Java.  Passing control to an other organization was the responsible thing to do.

Certainly the SE and EE release cycles were not the same.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Oracle has passed control of Java EE over to the Eclipse Foundation; see <a href=\"https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/09/12/jakarta-ee-8-the-new-era-of-java-ee-explained/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jakarta EE 8: The new era of Java EE explained</a></p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>I was reading that java ee's own functions would appear as deprecated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If someone actually wrote that Java EE is dead or &quot;deprecated&quot;, they are incorrect.

The first test will be the upcoming Jakarta EE 9 release which is scheduled for August / September 2020.

Writing and maintaining high quality specifications is expensive.  Since Oracle didn't have any significant (money making) Java EE products, Oracle management decided that it was not worth continuing to invest in that aspect of Java.  Passing control to an other organization was the responsible thing to do.

At the moment we're using a byte array approach and writing the output to a ZipOutputStream. For large files, I've read that it is better to use a stream instead of a byte array.

is surprisingly complicated.\r\n\r\nThe cast operator (`(SomeType) someExpr)`) does 3 almost entirely unrelated things. You&#39;re confusing a few of them here, I think.\r\n\r\nIf the `SomeType` is a primitive numeric type (`int`, `char`, `double`, `float`, `long`, `byte`, or `short`), then __casts convert one thing to another__.\r\n\r\nBut that&#39;s where the conversion aspect of casts end. In all other cases you&#39;re merely telling the compiler: I _know_ that the expression is of the type I am telling you it is. Sometimes, a runtime check is added (which will throw a `ClassCastException` if the expression turns out to not be of that type). Sometimes, the compiler just takes your word for it.\r\n\r\nThe generics part (`&lt;WebElement&gt;`) - that part is where the compiler will just take your word for it, and __that generates that warning__.\r\n\r\nBut that warning is completely irrelevant in this scenario: The problem isn&#39;t that part at all. The non-generics part (the `List`), that gets a runtime check. Because it gets a runtime check, the compiler won&#39;t warn: It&#39;s fine - if your type assertion turns out to be wrong, at runtime you&#39;ll get an exception that&#39;ll inform you about this.\r\n\r\nSo, the warning is about the `&lt;WebElement&gt;` part, but the error you get at runtime is about the `List` part.\r\n\r\nYour WebElement __is not a list__. Perhaps you are attempting to create a list containing a single element. In that case, you&#39;d want `List.of(ele);`.

You're confusing a few of them here, I think.</p>\n<p>If the <code>SomeType</code> is a primitive numeric type (<code>int</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>byte</code>, or <code>short</code>), then <strong>casts convert one thing to another</strong>.</p>\n<p>But that's where the conversion aspect of casts end. In all other cases you're merely telling the compiler: I <em>know</em> that the expression is of the type I am telling you it is. Sometimes, a runtime check is added (which will throw a <code>ClassCastException</code> if the expression turns out to not be of that type). Sometimes, the compiler just takes your word for it.</p>\n<p>The generics part (<code>&lt;WebElement&gt;</code>) - that part is where the compiler will just take your word for it, and <strong>that generates that warning</strong>.</p>\n<p>But that warning is completely irrelevant in this scenario: The problem isn't that part at all. The non-generics part (the <code>List</code>), that gets a runtime check.
