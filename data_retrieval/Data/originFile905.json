Create Android project with native C/C++ code support, e.g. like here: https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code.

Generate a C code **only** for a Matlab **function** that you really need. Check documentation (https://www.mathworks.com/help/dsp/ug/generate-c-code-from-matlab-code-1.html):\r\n   &gt; You do not have to generate code for the entire MATLAB application. If you have specific portions that are computationally intensive, generate code from these portions in order to speed up your algorithm.\r\n   &gt; Make Code Suitable for Code Generation\r\n3. Generate JNI with methods designed by yourself: e.g. you will have `MatLabJniApi.java` (JNI Java API) and you will get `com_your_MatLabJniApi.c` (and `com_your_MatLabJniApi.h`) as a result of `javac -h .

Or 1. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s where it ends. And __everything__ is, in the end, bits. This means: __That `-` is not a thing__. Computers do not know what - is and cannot store it. We need to write code and agree on some sort of meaning to represent them.\r\n\r\n## 2&#39;s complement\r\n\r\nSo what&#39;s -5 in bits? It&#39;s 1111 1011. Which seems bizarre. But it&#39;s how it works. If you write: `byte b = -5;`, then `b` will contain `1111 1011`. It is because `javac` made that happen. Similarly, if you then call `System.out.println(b)`, then the `println` method gets the bit sequence `1111 1011`. Why does the println method decide to print a - symbol and then a 5 symbol? Because it&#39;s programmed that way: We all are in agreement that 1111 1011 is -5. So why is that?\r\n\r\nBecause of a really cool property - signed/unsigned irrelevancy.\r\n\r\nThe rule is 2&#39;s complement: To switch the sign (i.e. turn 5, which is 0000 0101 into -5 which is 1111 1011), you flip every bit, and then add 1 to the end result. Try it with 0000 0101 - and you&#39;ll see it&#39;s 1111 1011. This algorithm is reversible - apply the same algorithm (flip every bit, then add 1) and you can turn -5 into 5.\r\n\r\nThis 2&#39;s complement thing has 2 great advantages:\r\n\r\n* There is only one 0 value. If we just flipped all bits, we&#39;d have both 1111 1111 and 0000 0000 both representing some form of 0. In basic math, there&#39;s no such thing as &#39;negative 0&#39; - it&#39;s the same as positive 0. Similarly if we just decided the first bit is the sign and the remaining 7 bits are the number, then we&#39;d have both 1000 0000 and 0000 0000 both being 0, which is annoying and inefficient, why waste 2 different bit sequences on the same number?\r\n* plus and minus are __sign-mode independent__. The computer doesn&#39;t have to KNOW whether we are doing the 2&#39;s complement thing or not. Take the bit sequence 1111 1011. If we treat that as unsigned bits, then that is 251 (it&#39;s 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 2 + 1). If we treat that as a signed number, then the first bit is 1, so the thing is negative: We apply 2&#39;s complement and figure out that it is -5. So, is it -5 or 251? It&#39;s both, at once! Depends on the human/code that __interprets__ this bit sequence which one it is. So how could the computer possibly do `a + b` given this? The weird answer is: It doesn&#39;t matter - because the math works out the same way. 251 - 10 is 241. -5 - 10 is -15. `-15` and `241` are the exact same bit sequence.\r\n\r\n## Overflow\r\n\r\nA byte is 8 bits, and there are 256 different sequences of bits, and then you have listed each and every possible variant. (2^8 = 256. Hence, a 16-bit number can be used to convey 65536 different things, because 2^16 is 65536, and so on). So, given that bytes are 8 bits and we decreed they are signed, and 2&#39;s complement signed, that means that the smallest number you can send with it is -128, which in bits is `1000 0000` (use 2&#39;s complement to check my work), and `+127`, which in bits is `0111 1111`. So what happens if you add 1 to 127? That&#39;d seemingly be +128 except that&#39;s not storable in 8 bits if we decree that we interpret these bits as 2&#39;s complement signed (which java does). What happens? The bits &#39;roll over&#39;. We just add 1 as normal, which turns `0111 1111` into `1000 0000` which is -128:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbyte b = 127;\r\nb = (byte)(b + 1);\r\nSystem.out.println(b); // prints -128\r\n```\r\n\r\nImagine the number line - stretching out into infinity on both ends, from -infinite to +infinite. That&#39;s the usual way math works. Computers (or rather, `int`, `long`, etc) do not work like that. Instead of a line, __it is a circle__. Take your infinite number line and take some scissors, and snip that number line at -128 (because a 2&#39;s comp signed byte cannot represent -129 or anything else below -128), and at +127 (because our byte cannot represent 128 or anything above it).\r\n\r\nAnd now tape the 2 cut ends together.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s the number line.

Or 1. That's it. That's where it ends. And <strong>everything</strong> is, in the end, bits. This means: <strong>That <code>-</code> is not a thing</strong>. Computers do not know what - is and cannot store it. We need to write code and agree on some sort of meaning to represent them.</p>\n<h2>2's complement</h2>\n<p>So what's -5 in bits? It's 1111 1011. Which seems bizarre. But it's how it works. If you write: <code>byte b = -5;</code>, then <code>b</code> will contain <code>1111 1011</code>. It is because <code>javac</code> made that happen. Similarly, if you then call <code>System.out.println(b)</code>, then the <code>println</code> method gets the bit sequence <code>1111 1011</code>. Why does the println method decide to print a - symbol and then a 5 symbol? Because it's programmed that way: We all are in agreement that 1111 1011 is -5. So why is that?</p>\n<p>Because of a really cool property - signed/unsigned irrelevancy.</p>\n<p>The rule is 2's complement: To switch the sign (i.e. turn 5, which is 0000 0101 into -5 which is 1111 1011), you flip every bit, and then add 1 to the end result. Try it with 0000 0101 - and you'll see it's 1111 1011. This algorithm is reversible - apply the same algorithm (flip every bit, then add 1) and you can turn -5 into 5.</p>\n<p>This 2's complement thing has 2 great advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is only one 0 value. If we just flipped all bits, we'd have both 1111 1111 and 0000 0000 both representing some form of 0. In basic math, there's no such thing as 'negative 0' - it's the same as positive 0. Similarly if we just decided the first bit is the sign and the remaining 7 bits are the number, then we'd have both 1000 0000 and 0000 0000 both being 0, which is annoying and inefficient, why waste 2 different bit sequences on the same number?</li>\n<li>plus and minus are <strong>sign-mode independent</strong>.

A valid JVM implementation could optimize this as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>volatile int a=0\n\nthread1:\n      a+=2\n\nthread2:\n     r1=a\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is valid since the results are r1={0,2} which is a subset of the legal results.</p>\n<p>The happens-before order (including the synchronizes-with order) is only used to determine the possible legal results and therefore you don't need to optimize any of them out.</p>\n<p>The JVM implementation is by no means obligated to preserve the original synchronization operations and hence has a lot of liberty for performance optimizations.</p>\n<p>For a better explanation, check out this great <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koU38cczBy8&amp;t=1241s\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">presentation</a> from Aleksey Shipilev</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":26845532,"reputation":21,"user_id":20431343,"display_name":"cata"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":123,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":74337343,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1667773199,"creation_date":1667731115,"question_id":74335069,"body_markdown":"[JLS states this](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4.5):\r\n&gt; A set of synchronization edges, _S_, is _sufficient_ if it is the minimal set such that the transitive closure of S with the program order determines all of the happens-before edges in the execution.

This is because <code>90000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</code> and <code>-90000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</code> (as well as how they are handled) have very significant fundamental differences when compared to <code>1000</code> and <code>-1000</code></p>\n<p>With that said, Java and Javascript still deal with numbers the same as PHP, C, etc when they are within the range of what the system can handle naively. I don't see why they muddied the water by throwing in an &quot;unsigned shift&quot;. No matter how you break it down, your just dealing with a virtual instruction as well as other higher level concepts of how a value is being represented.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":3535373,"reputation":2394,"user_id":2953830,"display_name":"frzsombor"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1651,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":7,"accepted_answer_id":43359819,"answer_count":3,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1667767143,"creation_date":1481685790,"question_id":41134337,"body_markdown":"Before flagging this as a duplicate, please read below, and check &lt;s&gt; [my code][1] &lt;/s&gt; * [my updated code][2]!\r\n\r\nSo my problem is that, I have to implement Java/JavaScript &#39;&gt;&gt;&gt;&#39; (Unsigned Right Shift / Zero-fill Right Shift), but I can&#39;t get it work exactly the same way.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve selected the 11 most promising implementations I&#39;ve found on SO and on the web (links are added as comments in the code) and added a few test cases.

In your case 10! is 10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 3628800. The proof why it is exactly right is right solution for generation also.\r\nWell so how. On first position i.e. from left you can have 10 numbers, on the second position you can have only 9 numbers, because one number is on the position on the left and we cannot repeat the same number etc. (the proof is done by mathematical induction).\r\nSo how to generate first ten results? According my knowledges, he simplest way is to use cyclic shift.
