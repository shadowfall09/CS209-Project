Instead, this method is merely a shortcut for using `CSVPrinter` to generate the text of what would be written to your CSV file if your CSV file were the actual target of output. With this `format` method, the text generated is merely returned to the calling code.\r\n\r\nYou need to understand that Commons CSV does not do *binding*. The library merely parses pieces of CSV as plain text, not objects. So specifying a date-time formatting pattern with *Commons CSV* makes no sense; that&#39;s not a feature.\r\n\r\nYou must write your own Java code to produce the strings you want to send out to a CSV file through *Commons CSV*.\r\n\r\nSo you need to do the parsing from text to date-time object yourself. If you have a string such as `2022-11-23 00:00:00.0000`, you should be parsing as a [`LocalDateTime`][4] object. To do so, you could define your own formatting pattern with `DateTimeFormatter` class. But instead I would do a bit of string manipulation to alter the input by [replacing][5] the SPACE in the middle with a `T`: \r\n\r\n    LocalDateTime myLocalDateTime = LocalDateTime.parse( &quot;2022-11-23 00:00:00.0000&quot;.replace( &quot; &quot; , &quot;T&quot; ) ) ;\r\n\r\nTo learn more about using *Apache Commons CSV*, search Stack Overflow.

The certificates are `certs.pem` and `key.pem` and these 2 certs when I am using with Python code it is giving me response. Below is Python code snippet that I am using - \r\n\r\n    url = &quot;https://example.com&quot;\r\n    cert = (certs.pem, key.pem)\r\n    response = requests.get(url, cert=cert, verify=False)\r\n   \r\nNow same GET call I want to use in java. And since Java mostly accept `.jks` file. So, I am trying to convert both `.pem` files to single `.jks` file.\r\n\r\nTo convert to jks file I am first combining both `.pem` file using command- `cat certs.pem key.pem &gt; combined.pem`. \r\n\r\nAfter generating combined pem I am converting it to `.p12` file using command-  `openssl pkcs12 -export -in combined.pem -out cert.p12`. I am not using any password while creating p12 file.\r\n\r\nAfter generating `.p12` file I am converting it to `.crt` file using command- `openssl pkcs12 -in cert.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out out_cert.crt`\r\n\r\nAnd finally I am converting to .jks file using below code snippet - \r\n\r\n       private static Certificate readCert(String path) throws IOException, CertificateException {\r\n            try (FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream(path)) {\r\n                return CertificateFactory.getInstance(&quot;X.509&quot;).generateCertificate(fin);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        // To convert into jks\r\n        public static void generateCert() {\r\n            try {\r\n                // Reading the cert\r\n                Certificate cert = readCert(&quot;out_cert.crt&quot;);\r\n            \r\n                // Creating an empty JKS keystore\r\n                KeyStore keystore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());\r\n                keystore.load(null, null);\r\n            \r\n                // Adding the cert to the keystore\r\n                keystore.setCertificateEntry(&quot;somecert&quot;, cert);\r\n            \r\n                // Saving the keystore with a zero length password\r\n                FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(&quot;final_cert.jks&quot;);\r\n                keystore.store(fout, new char[0]);\r\n            } catch (GeneralSecurityException | IOException e) {\r\n                // TODO Auto-generated catch block\r\n                e.printStackTrace();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nSince I want to generate `.jks` file without password so I am using above code snippet. We can not generate `.jks` file without password with `keytool`.\r\n\r\nNow finally after generating the `.jks` file, I am using below code snippet to make GET call - \r\n\r\n        private static final String GET_API = &quot;https://example.com&quot;;\r\n    \r\n        private static Client getClient() throws Exception {\r\n    \r\n            KeyStore keystore =

is going wrong in my complete process?\r\n\r\nThanks in Advance :-)\r\n","title":"InvalidAlgorithmParameterException: the trustAnchors parameter must be non-empty","body":"<p>I have 2 certificates that I am using to make a GET request. The certificates are <code>certs.pem</code> and <code>key.pem</code> and these 2 certs when I am using with Python code it is giving me response. Below is Python code snippet that I am using -</p>\n<pre><code>url = &quot;https://example.com&quot;\ncert = (certs.pem, key.pem)\nresponse = requests.get(url, cert=cert, verify=False)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now same GET call I want to use in java. And since Java mostly accept <code>.jks</code> file. So, I am trying to convert both <code>.pem</code> files to single <code>.jks</code> file.</p>\n<p>To convert to jks file I am first combining both <code>.pem</code> file using command- <code>cat certs.pem key.pem &gt; combined.pem</code>.</p>\n<p>After generating combined pem I am converting it to <code>.p12</code> file using command-  <code>openssl pkcs12 -export -in combined.pem -out cert.p12</code>. I am not using any password while creating p12 file.</p>\n<p>After generating <code>.p12</code> file I am converting it to <code>.crt</code> file using command- <code>openssl pkcs12 -in cert.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out out_cert.crt</code></p>\n<p>And finally I am converting to .jks file using below code snippet -</p>\n<pre><code>   private static Certificate readCert(String path) throws IOException, CertificateException {\n        try (FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream(path)) {\n            return CertificateFactory.getInstance(&quot;X.509&quot;).generateCertificate(fin);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // To convert into jks\n    public static void generateCert() {\n        try {\n            // Reading the cert\n            Certificate cert = readCert(&quot;out_cert.crt&quot;);\n        \n            // Creating an empty JKS keystore\n            KeyStore keystore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());\n            keystore.load(null, null);\n        \n            // Adding the cert to the keystore\n            keystore.setCertificateEntry(&quot;somecert&quot;, cert);\n        \n            // Saving the keystore with a zero length password\n            FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(&quot;final_cert.jks&quot;);\n            keystore.store(fout, new char[0]);\n        } catch (GeneralSecurityException | IOException e) {\n            // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since I want to generate <code>.jks</code> file without password so I am using above code snippet. We can not generate <code>.jks</code> file without password with <code>keytool</code>.</p>\n<p>Now finally after generating the <code>.jks</code> file, I am using below code snippet to make GET call -</p>\n<pre><code>    private static final String GET_API = &quot;https://example.com&quot;;\n\n    private static Client getClient() throws Exception {\n\n        KeyStore keystore =

keystore.load(tsStream, null);\n        TrustManagerFactory tmg = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());\n        tmg.init(keystore);\n        TrustManager[] trustManager = tmg.getTrustManagers();\n\n        SSLContext sslContext = null;\n        sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance(&quot;TLS&quot;);\n        sslContext.init(null, trustManager, null);\n\n\n

Since Hibernate 5 does not support all previous naming schemes, I had to use solution from <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/53293897/519035\">this answer</a> - maybe it will also help someone as well.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":5096768,"reputation":1551,"user_id":4087817,"display_name":"ngg"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1653391882,"creation_date":1653391882,"answer_id":72362117,"question_id":30337582,"body_markdown":"&gt; ***declaring a data source in Spring Boot application.properties***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    spring.datasource.company.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/company_db?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true&amp;autoReconnect=true&amp;useSSL=false&amp;allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true\r\n    spring.datasource.company.username=root\r\n    spring.datasource.company.password=root\r\n    spring.datasource.company.platform=mysql\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    spring.datasource.employee.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/employee_db?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true&amp;autoReconnect=true&amp;useSSL=false&amp;allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true\r\n    spring.datasource.employee.username=root\r\n    spring.datasource.employee.password=root\r\n    spring.datasource.employee.platform=mysql\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n&gt; use multiple data sources, we need to declare multiple beans with\r\n&gt; different mappings within Spring&#39;s application context.\r\n&gt; using a configuration class\r\n\r\n***\r\n    @Configuration\r\n    @EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = &quot;com.example.multiple.datasources.entity.company&quot;,\r\n            entityManagerFactoryRef = &quot;companyEntityManagerFactory&quot;,\r\n            transactionManagerRef = &quot;companyTransactionManager&quot;)\r\n    public class CompanyDataSourceConfiguration {\r\n    \r\n        @Bean\r\n        @ConfigurationProperties(&quot;spring.datasource.company&quot;)\r\n        public DataSourceProperties companyDataSourceProperties() {\r\n            return new DataSourceProperties();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Bean\r\n        @ConfigurationProperties(&quot;spring.datasource.company.configuration&quot;)\r\n        public DataSource companyDataSource() {\r\n            return companyDataSourceProperties().initializeDataSourceBuilder()\r\n                    .type(HikariDataSource.class).build();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Bean(name = &quot;companyEntityManagerFactory&quot;)\r\n        public LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean companyEntityManagerFactory(EntityManagerFactoryBuilder builder) {\r\n            return builder.dataSource(companyDataSource()).packages(Company.class).build();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Bean\r\n        public PlatformTransactionManager companyTransactionManager(\r\n                final @Qualifier(&quot;companyEntityManagerFactory&quot;) LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean companyEntityManagerFactory\r\n        ) {\r\n            return new JpaTransactionManager(companyEntityManagerFactory.getObject());\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n&gt; we need to declare one of the datasources as @Primary.

After fixing a some compilation issues, I stumbled upon an issue similar to the following question: [ClassCast Error: Java 7 vs Java 8][1].\r\n\r\nTo summarise, here is a sample code that shows the issue:\r\n\r\n    public class Test {\r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            System.out.println(String.valueOf(getVal(&quot;xxx&quot;))); // 7: prints the result, 8: Exception \r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @SuppressWarnings(&quot;unchecked&quot;)\r\n        public static &lt;T&gt; T getVal(String param) {\r\n            // do some computation based on param...\r\n            return (T) result; // actual return type only depends on param so the caller knows what to expect\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe idea was that we would trust that the caller knows the expected type, and this would avoid him an explicit cast (_I’m not saying this was a good idea…_). In a lot of cases, the caller just expects an `Object` so there was no implicit cast at all.\r\n\r\nAs stated in the question above, the `String.valueOf` example worked fine in Java 7 because there was no type inference, hence `Object` was assumed. Now in Java 8, the compiler chooses the most specific type (here `char[]`), which causes a `ClastCastException` at runtime.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we have around 350 calls of this `getVal` method. **Is there a way to detect overloaded method calls that would differ between Java 7 and Java 8?** I.E. detect when the Java 8 compiler would select a different method from the Java 7 compiler.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23155907/classcast-error-java-7-vs-java-8","title":"How to detect ambiguous method calls that would cause a ClassCastException in Java 8?","body":"<p>We are currently in the process of migrating an application from Java 7 to Java 8.

Basically, it&#39;s when you have a variable number of arguments of a type-parameter type:\r\n\r\n    &lt;T&gt; void foo(T... args);\r\n\r\nIn Java, varargs are a syntactic sugar that undergoes a simple &quot;re-writing&quot; at compile-time: a varargs parameter of type `X...` is converted into a parameter of type `X[]`; and every time a call is made to this varargs method, the compiler collects all of the &quot;variable arguments&quot; that goes in the varargs parameter, and creates an array just like `new X[] { ...(arguments go here)... }`.\r\n\r\nThis works well when the varargs type is concrete like `String...`. When it&#39;s a type variable like `T...`, it also works when `T` is known to be a concrete type for that call. e.g. if the method above were part of a class `Foo&lt;T&gt;`, and you have a `Foo&lt;String&gt;` reference, then calling `foo` on it would be okay because we know `T` is `String` at that point in the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, it does not work when the &quot;value&quot; of `T` is another type parameter. In Java, it is impossible to create an array of a type-parameter component type (`new T[] { ... }`). So Java instead uses `new Object[] { ... }` (here `Object` is the upper bound of `T`; if there upper bound were something different, it would be that instead of `Object`), and then gives you a compiler warning.\r\n\r\nSo what is wrong with creating `new Object[]` instead of `new T[]` or whatever? Well, arrays in Java know their component type at runtime. Thus, the passed array object will have the wrong component type at runtime.\r\n\r\nFor probably the most common use of varargs, simply to iterate over the elements, this is no problem (you don&#39;t care about the runtime type of the array), so this is safe:\r\n\r\n    @SafeVarargs\r\n    final &lt;T&gt; void foo(T... args) {\r\n        for (T x : args) {\r\n            // do stuff with x\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHowever, for anything that depends on the runtime component type of the passed array, it will not be safe.
