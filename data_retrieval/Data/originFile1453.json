I.e. there are **`52`** possibilities to chose from. \r\n\r\nAfter the *first card* has been picked, you need to choose the next one, and there&#39;s a **`51`** way to make this choice. \r\n\r\nThat means that the total number of ways of how **2 cards** can be picked is **`52*51`**.\r\n\r\nThen, for the *third card*, we have only **`50`** cards remaining in the deck.\r\n\r\nThat means that there are **`52*51*50`** ways to choose **3 cards** from the deck. \r\n\r\nFor **four cards**, that number will be **`52*51*50*49`**, for **five** - **`52*51*50*49*48`**, and so on. \r\n\r\nThat is a so-called **proof by induction** that there are **`52*51*50*49*48*...*3*2*1`** (*and that is a factorial - **`52!`***) ways to pick **`52`** cards from the deck. \r\n\r\nNow, you might think of each *character* in a *string* as if it&#39;s a *card* and the *string* itself is a *deck* of size `n`. Similarly, there will be **`n!`** way to pick all `n` *characters* from this *string*.\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Algorithm - costs of operations&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nSince the number of **permutations** is `n!` that means that we need to generate `n!` *strings* of length `n`.\r\n\r\nEach *string* has to be constructed letter by letter:\r\n```\r\nprefix + str.charAt(i) // append a charactor at position `i` to the `prefix` string\r\n```\r\nIn order to create a *string* of length `n`, we need to pick a *character* `n` times in a loop. Each step of iteration will spawn a recursive method call. Therefore, **`n*n!`** method calls will be required to construct all `n!` *permutations*.\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s an additional cost that contributes to the total time complexity.\r\n\r\nCreation of the remaining string (*characters that are not picked yet*) requires to invoke \r\n```\r\nstr.substring(0, i) + str.substring(i + 1)\r\n```\r\nat each method call. And that will cost **O(n)** time because in order to create a substring we have iterated over the source string and copy up to `n - 1` characters from its underlying array into the new string.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the overall time complexity will be **O(n^2*n!)**.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/SDdLO.jpg","title":"How to estimate the Time Complexity of generating string Permutations using Recursion tree","body":"<h3>Recursion Call Tree</h3>\n<p>The formula <strong><code>branches ^ depth</code></strong> is applicable for time-complexity analysis when each recursive call spawn the <em><strong>same number of branches</strong></em>.

I.e. there are <strong><code>52</code></strong> possibilities to chose from.</p>\n<p>After the <em>first card</em> has been picked, you need to choose the next one, and there's a <strong><code>51</code></strong> way to make this choice.</p>\n<p>That means that the total number of ways of how <strong>2 cards</strong> can be picked is <strong><code>52*51</code></strong>.</p>\n<p>Then, for the <em>third card</em>, we have only <strong><code>50</code></strong> cards remaining in the deck.</p>\n<p>That means that there are <strong><code>52*51*50</code></strong> ways to choose <strong>3 cards</strong> from the deck.</p>\n<p>For <strong>four cards</strong>, that number will be <strong><code>52*51*50*49</code></strong>, for <strong>five</strong> - <strong><code>52*51*50*49*48</code></strong>, and so on.</p>\n<p>That is a so-called <strong>proof by induction</strong> that there are <strong><code>52*51*50*49*48*...*3*2*1</code></strong> (<em>and that is a factorial - <strong><code>52!</code></strong></em>) ways to pick <strong><code>52</code></strong> cards from the deck.</p>\n<p>Now, you might think of each <em>character</em> in a <em>string</em> as if it's a <em>card</em> and the <em>string</em> itself is a <em>deck</em> of size <code>n</code>. Similarly, there will be <strong><code>n!</code></strong> way to pick all <code>n</code> <em>characters</em> from this <em>string</em>.</p>\n<h3>Algorithm - costs of operations</h3>\n<p>Since the number of <strong>permutations</strong> is <code>n!</code> that means that we need to generate <code>n!</code> <em>strings</em> of length <code>n</code>.</p>\n<p>Each <em>string</em> has to be constructed letter by letter:</p>\n<pre><code>prefix + str.charAt(i) // append a charactor at position `i` to the `prefix` string\n</code></pre>\n<p>In order to create a <em>string</em> of length <code>n</code>, we need to pick a <em>character</em> <code>n</code> times in a loop. Each step of iteration will spawn a recursive method call. Therefore, <strong><code>n*n!</code></strong> method calls will be required to construct all <code>n!</code> <em>permutations</em>.</p>\n<p>There's an additional cost that contributes to the total time complexity.</p>\n<p>Creation of the remaining string (<em>characters that are not picked yet</em>) requires to invoke</p>\n<pre><code>str.substring(0, i) + str.substring(i + 1)\n</code></pre>\n<p>at each method call. And that will cost <strong>O(n)</strong> time because in order to create a substring we have iterated over the source string and copy up to <code>n - 1</code> characters from its underlying array into the new string.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the overall time complexity will be <strong>O(n^2*n!)</strong>.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":9594919,"reputation":478,"user_id":7124380,"accept_rate":83,"display_name":"Warren Crasta"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1649270869,"creation_date":1649270869,"answer_id":71772160,"question_id":71767980,"body_markdown":"As [@rici](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1566221/rici) suggested in the comments, branches&lt;sup&gt;depth&lt;/sup&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to be a good estimation  when the number of branches for a node varies based on the recursion depth, as seen in this problem.\r\n\r\nFor this problem, it seems that a better way to estimate the number of nodes is to use the formula described by [@Shubham](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1754982/shubham) [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13467674/determining-complexity-for-recursive-functions-big-o-notation/43991156#43991156):\r\n&gt; Complexity = length of tree from root node to leaf node * number of leaf nodes\r\n\r\nWhen I draw the recursion tree of this function for a string of length n, I see that there are n! leaf nodes.

I chose the &quot;gradlew&quot; file to copy into the main class in my current Procfile as a guess. Here are the collected arguments at the bottom of the gradlew file.\r\n[gradlew][2] \r\n\r\nI have tried putting the main class in the Procfile by reference (com.deepdraft.deep_draft.DeepDraftApplication) and by the path (java/com/deepdraft/deep_draft/DeepDraftApplication.java). Both Procfiles resulted in a log that said &quot;Error: Could not find or load main class.&quot; Here is a photo of the full log.\r\n[logs][3]\r\n\r\nBut honestly I&#39;m not sure why the Procfile needs me to write a script that copies files from one directory to the other. I am just trying this out because the Heroku documentation used this Procfile as an example for SpringBoot projects.\r\n\r\nSorry if this information is all over the place, but I am a new developer who is very excited to deploy my first app. How do I build a Procfile?\r\n\r\n(Edit) Ok actually I have found a jar file! I was using &quot;.jar&quot; in my terminal instead of &quot;jar&quot; and have found a gradlewrapper.jar file. I&#39;m going to try using this file to follow the first Procfile example above, using the -jar command. [gradlewrapper.jar][4]\r\n\r\n(Edit 2) Wow I feel like I am so close.

I'm a new developer and could use some help with how the Linux process model works.</p>\n<p>The Heroku documentation provides two Procfile examples for Java Spring Boot projects:</p>\n<p><code>web: java -Dserver.port=$PORT $JAVA_OPTS -jar build/libs/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</code></p>\n<p><code>web: java $JAVA_OPTS -cp target/classes:target/dependency/* com.example.HelloWorld</code></p>\n<p>I decided to try following the -cp example because I do not have any .jar files.</p>\n<p>This is my current Procfile:</p>\n<p><code>web: java $JAVA_OPTS -cp gradlew java/com/deepdraft/deep_draft/DeepDraftApplication.java</code>\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7dbVQ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">procfile</a></p>\n<p>During a developer interview recently I asked briefly about the Procfile and he suggested I refer to my &quot;gradlew&quot; file when writing the Procfile, but I didn't get a chance to ask if I was copying a command from this file or directing the Procfile to the command within the file. I chose the &quot;gradlew&quot; file to copy into the main class in my current Procfile as a guess. Here are the collected arguments at the bottom of the gradlew file.\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/t7Tfx.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">gradlew</a></p>\n<p>I have tried putting the main class in the Procfile by reference (com.deepdraft.deep_draft.DeepDraftApplication) and by the path (java/com/deepdraft/deep_draft/DeepDraftApplication.java). Both Procfiles resulted in a log that said &quot;Error: Could not find or load main class.&quot; Here is a photo of the full log.\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/n7SEW.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">logs</a></p>\n<p>But honestly I'm not sure why the Procfile needs me to write a script that copies files from one directory to the other. I am just trying this out because the Heroku documentation used this Procfile as an example for SpringBoot projects.</p>\n<p>Sorry if this information is all over the place, but I am a new developer who is very excited to deploy my first app. How do I build a Procfile?</p>\n<p>(Edit) Ok actually I have found a jar file! I was using &quot;.jar&quot; in my terminal instead of &quot;jar&quot; and have found a gradlewrapper.jar file. I'm going to try using this file to follow the first Procfile example above, using the -jar command. <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wQWFn.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">gradlewrapper.jar</a></p>\n<p>(Edit 2) Wow I feel like I am so close.

 // 1.0\r\n\r\nBigDecimal randBigDecimal = min.add(\r\n  norm.multiply(\r\n    new BigDecimal(\r\n      Math.random()\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n); // equivalent to e + (1.0 * Math.random())\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `Math.random()` returns 0, randBigDecimal equals: e;\r\nIf `Math.random()` returns Double.MIN_VALUE, randBigDecimal equals: `Double.MIN_VALUE + e`.\r\n\r\nWe can innumerate all possible values of randBigDecimal like so:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ndouble d = 0.0;\r\n\r\n// Don&#39;t actually run this loop!  :)\r\nwhile (d &lt; 1.0) {\r\n  System.out.println(e + d);\r\n  d = Math.nextUp(d);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe more that the scale of e exceeds the scale of Java&#39;s double precision floating point numeric type, i.e. the primary motivation for using BigDecimal, the larger the gaps this algorithm leaves between `e + d` and `e + Math.nextUp(d)`. \r\n\r\nIn any case, this algorithm always leaves out min + 2e, min + 3e, ..., min + (N-1)e, min + Ne. For all integers [2, N] such that `(new BigDecimal(N).times(new BigDecimal(Double.MIN_VALUE))).scale() &gt; e.scale()`.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, many infinities of numbers exist between e and 2e, but we might like our random BigDecimal algorithm to cover at least all values with the same scale as `Math.max(min.scale(), MAX.scale())`.","title":"Generating random BigDecimal value from given range","body":"<p>Previous answers don't address the loss of precision that results from scaling values with arbitrarily large numbers of digits by double precision floating point values with a relatively small number of digits.

Both methods the checkin and checkout methods are showing the desired number of elements in the value set for the particular key. But the value returned in the `main` is always an empty set.

The current code applies an autofilter correctly when using LibreOffice, but the cells are locked when using Excel 365, and the filter is therefore not clickable. \r\n\r\nFreezing the header row, and setting custom column width works in both LibreOffice and Excel 365.\r\n\r\n**What I have tried**\r\n\r\n - I have tried protecting the sheet using `sheet.protectSheet(&quot;x&quot;);` and `sheet.enableLocking();` both not solving the issue.\r\n - Using `XSSSF` instead of the faster version `SXSSF`, with no difference.\r\n - Removing the protection from the sheet fixes the autofilter issue, but naturally does not lock cells.\r\n - Using the online version of Excel 365, as well as the desktop application. Produces the same result.\r\n - Unlocking the header row cell, where the filter is applied. The cell becomes editable, but I am still not able to click the filter button. \r\n - Unlocking the header row cell, and manually trying to apply autofilter using Excel 365.

Otherwise, continue with step\n  4.</li>\n  <li><strong>Execute the instance initializers and instance variable initializers for\n  this class</strong>, assigning the values of\n  instance variable initializers to the\n  corresponding instance variables, in\n  the left-to-right order in which they\n  appear textually in the source code\n  for the class. If execution of any of\n  these initializers results in an\n  exception, then no further\n  initializers are processed and this\n  procedure completes abruptly with that\n  same exception. Otherwise, continue\n  with step 5. (In some early\n  implementations, the compiler\n  incorrectly omitted the code to\n  initialize a field if the field\n  initializer expression was a constant\n  expression whose value was equal to\n  the default initialization value for\n  its type.)</li>\n  <li>Execute the rest of the body of this constructor.
