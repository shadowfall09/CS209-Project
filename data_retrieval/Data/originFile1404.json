Here is additional points and some example code.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, there is no need to declare &amp; cast [`ThreadPoolExecutor`][2] directly. Just use the more general [`ExecutorService`][3].\r\n\r\nAnd using a thread pool sized to your batch size seems unwise. In current Java, you generally want an active thread pool to be less than the count of CPU cores. (This calculus will change radically if [Project Loom][4] and its [virtual threads][5] succeeds, but that is not the reality today, though you can try the [early-access build][6].)\r\n\r\n    int threadPoolSize = 3 ;  // Generally less than number of cores. \r\n    ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool( threadPoolSize );\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s simplify your example scenario. We define `Widget` as a simple [record][7]. \r\n\r\n    record Widget ( UUID id , Instant whenCreated ) {}\r\n\r\nDefine a task that produces a `Widget`. We want to get back a `Widget` object, so we use `Callable` rather than `Runnable`. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nCallable &lt; Widget &gt; makeWidgetTask = ( ) -&gt; {\r\n    Thread.sleep( Duration.ofMillis( 50 ).toMillis() ); // Pretend that we have a long-running task.\r\n    Widget widget = new Widget( UUID.randomUUID() , Instant.now() );\r\n    return widget;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake a big collection, to be used in running that task many times.\r\n\r\n    List &lt; Callable &lt; Widget &gt; &gt; tasks = Collections.nCopies( 1_000 , makeWidgetTask );\r\n\r\nActually, we need to wrap in a try-catch.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList &lt; Future &lt; Widget &gt; &gt; futures = null;\r\ntry\r\n{\r\n    futures = executorService.invokeAll( tasks );\r\n}\r\ncatch ( InterruptedException e )\r\n{\r\n    throw new RuntimeException( e );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSubmit all those tasks to the executor service. Notice how we get back a list of [`Future`][8] objects. A `Future` is our handle to the success or failure of each task’s completion.\r\n\r\nAs for how to wait for completion, and how to use `ExecutorService#shutdown`, `shutdownNow`, and `awaitTermination`, merely read the Javadoc. &#128073; A full example of boilerplate code is provided for you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo quote the Javadoc:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npool.shutdown(); // Disable new tasks from being submitted\r\ntry {\r\n    // Wait a while for existing tasks to terminate\r\n    if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {\r\n        pool.shutdownNow(); // Cancel currently executing tasks\r\n        // Wait a while for tasks to respond to being cancelled\r\n        if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS))\r\n            System.err.println(&quot;Pool did not terminate&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n} catch (InterruptedException ex) {\r\n    // (Re-)Cancel if current thread also interrupted\r\n    pool.shutdownNow();\r\n    // Preserve interrupt status\r\n    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe key concept is that `shutdown` does not stop any work-in-progress. All tasks currently under execution will continue. All submitted tasks will eventually be scheduled for execution on a core as a thread becomes available. The `shutdown` method does only one thing: Stop any further tasks from being submitted to this executor service. To quote the Javadoc:\r\n\r\n&gt;`shutdown()` … previously submitted tasks are executed, but no new tasks will be accepted.\r\n\r\nTo quote further:\r\n\r\n&gt;This method does not wait for previously submitted tasks to complete execution. Use `awaitTermination` to do that.\r\n\r\nSo you need to call `awaitTermination` after calling `shutdown`. You pass arguments for a reasonable time in which you expect all submitted tasks to be completed or cancelled or interrupted. If that time limit elapses, then you can presume something has gone wrong.\r\n\r\nNotice that the call to `shutdown` does *not* block, but the call to `awaitTermination` *does* block.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s adapt the boilerplate code to our own example.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nexecutorService.shutdown(); // Disable new tasks from being submitted.\r\ntry\r\n{\r\n    if ( ! executorService.awaitTermination( 60 , TimeUnit.SECONDS ) )\r\n    {\r\n        executorService.shutdownNow(); // Cancel currently executing tasks.\r\n        // Wait a while for tasks to respond to being cancelled.\r\n        if ( ! executorService.awaitTermination( 60 , TimeUnit.SECONDS ) )\r\n        { System.err.println( &quot;Executor service did not terminate.&quot; ); }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\ncatch ( InterruptedException ex )\r\n{\r\n    executorService.shutdownNow();  // (Re-)Cancel if current thread also interrupted\r\n    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();  // Preserve interrupt status\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, review our results by examining the collection of `Future` objects.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nSystem.out.println( &quot;Count futures: &quot; + futures.size() );\r\nfor ( Future &lt; Widget &gt; future : futures )\r\n{\r\n    if ( ! future.isDone() ) { System.out.println( &quot;Oops!

Here is additional points and some example code.</p>\n<p>For one thing, there is no need to declare &amp; cast <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutor.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code></a> directly. Just use the more general <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>ExecutorService</code></a>.</p>\n<p>And using a thread pool sized to your batch size seems unwise. In current Java, you generally want an active thread pool to be less than the count of CPU cores. (This calculus will change radically if <a href=\"https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/loom/Main\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Project Loom</a> and its <a href=\"https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/425\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">virtual threads</a> succeeds, but that is not the reality today, though you can try the <a href=\"https://jdk.java.net/loom/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">early-access build</a>.)</p>\n<pre><code>int threadPoolSize = 3 ;  // Generally less than number of cores. \nExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool( threadPoolSize );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's simplify your example scenario. We define <code>Widget</code> as a simple <a href=\"http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/395\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">record</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>record Widget ( UUID id , Instant whenCreated ) {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Define a task that produces a <code>Widget</code>. We want to get back a <code>Widget</code> object, so we use <code>Callable</code> rather than <code>Runnable</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>Callable &lt; Widget &gt; makeWidgetTask = ( ) -&gt; {\n    Thread.sleep( Duration.ofMillis( 50 ).toMillis() ); // Pretend that we have a long-running task.\n    Widget widget = new Widget( UUID.randomUUID() , Instant.now() );\n    return widget;\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Make a big collection, to be used in running that task many times.</p>\n<pre><code>List &lt; Callable &lt; Widget &gt; &gt; tasks = Collections.nCopies( 1_000 , makeWidgetTask );\n</code></pre>\n<p>Actually, we need to wrap in a try-catch.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>List &lt; Future &lt; Widget &gt; &gt; futures = null;\ntry\n{\n    futures = executorService.invokeAll( tasks );\n}\ncatch ( InterruptedException e )\n{\n    throw new RuntimeException( e );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Submit all those tasks to the executor service. Notice how we get back a list of <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Future.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Future</code></a> objects. A <code>Future</code> is our handle to the success or failure of each task’s completion.</p>\n<p>As for how to wait for completion, and how to use <code>ExecutorService#shutdown</code>, <code>shutdownNow</code>, and <code>awaitTermination</code>, merely read the Javadoc. 👉 A full example of boilerplate code is provided for you.</p>\n<p>To quote the Javadoc:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>pool.shutdown(); // Disable new tasks from being submitted\ntry {\n    // Wait a while for existing tasks to terminate\n    if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {\n        pool.shutdownNow(); // Cancel currently executing tasks\n        // Wait a while for tasks to respond to being cancelled\n        if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS))\n            System.err.println(&quot;Pool did not terminate&quot;);\n    }\n} catch (InterruptedException ex) {\n    // (Re-)Cancel if current thread also interrupted\n    pool.shutdownNow();\n    // Preserve interrupt status\n    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The key concept is that <code>shutdown</code> does not stop any work-in-progress. All tasks currently under execution will continue. All submitted tasks will eventually be scheduled for execution on a core as a thread becomes available. The <code>shutdown</code> method does only one thing: Stop any further tasks from being submitted to this executor service. To quote the Javadoc:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>shutdown()</code> … previously submitted tasks are executed, but no new tasks will be accepted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To quote further:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This method does not wait for previously submitted tasks to complete execution. Use <code>awaitTermination</code> to do that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So you need to call <code>awaitTermination</code> after calling <code>shutdown</code>. You pass arguments for a reasonable time in which you expect all submitted tasks to be completed or cancelled or interrupted.

(in the other example that i have working i have RestClient on consumer side,  RegisterRestClient on interface like above and it is working)"},{"owner":{"account_id":15400934,"reputation":1598,"user_id":11110455,"display_name":"Felipe Windmoller"},"score":0,"creation_date":1650720035,"post_id":71972756,"comment_id":127189716,"body_markdown":"I&#39;ve never tested the injection of the Rest Client Interface in your consumer without the @Inject, in the Quarkus guide it says to declare as `@Inject\n    @RestClient\n    FeatureServiceClient serviceClient;` I don&#39;t know if it makes any difference.","body":"I&#39;ve never tested the injection of the Rest Client Interface in your consumer without the @Inject, in the Quarkus guide it says to declare as <code>@Inject     @RestClient     FeatureServiceClient serviceClient;</code> I don&#39;t know if it makes any difference."}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2090586,"reputation":4006,"user_id":1860517,"accept_rate":85,"display_name":"mangusbrother"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1650869117,"creation_date":1650869117,"answer_id":71995436,"question_id":71972756,"body_markdown":"So, found the solution.\r\n\r\nI added the following build plugins to the module contianing my Client interface\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n  &lt;build&gt;\r\n    &lt;plugins&gt;\r\n      &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n        &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-compiler-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;version&gt;3.8.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n      &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n      &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-compiler-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;version&gt;${compiler-plugin.version}&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n          &lt;parameters&gt;${maven.compiler.parameters}&lt;/parameters&gt;\r\n          &lt;annotationProcessorPaths&gt;\r\n            &lt;path&gt;\r\n              &lt;groupId&gt;org.projectlombok&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n              &lt;artifactId&gt;lombok&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n              &lt;version&gt;${org.projectlombok.version}&lt;/version&gt;\r\n            &lt;/path&gt;\r\n          &lt;/annotationProcessorPaths&gt;\r\n          &lt;!-- the parameters=true option is critical so that RESTEasy works fine --&gt;\r\n          &lt;parameters&gt;true&lt;/parameters&gt;\r\n        &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n      &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n      &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n        &lt;groupId&gt;org.jboss.jandex&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;jandex-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;version&gt;1.1.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;executions&gt;\r\n          &lt;execution&gt;\r\n            &lt;id&gt;make-index&lt;/id&gt;\r\n            &lt;goals&gt;\r\n              &lt;goal&gt;jandex&lt;/goal&gt;\r\n            &lt;/goals&gt;\r\n          &lt;/execution&gt;\r\n        &lt;/executions&gt;\r\n      &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n    &lt;/plugins&gt;\r\n  &lt;/build&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nnot entirely sure which of those caused the error to get solved really and i wouldn&#39;t expect such an error for any of those being missing.\r\n","title":"Not a REST client interface: interface MyClient.

A third option, not shown, would be to close the ROOM database and then access the database using an SQLiteDatabase instance to reset the sequence.\r\n\r\n#Option A\r\n\r\nYou can do this by **DROP**ing the table and then recreating it using a SupportSQLiteDatabase instance. \r\n\r\nThe following is a demo of option A (but also includes unnecessary closing of the Room database and also use of the database outside of room object-wise, however this has been added as proof of the technique by extracting data from sqlite_sequence).\r\n\r\n#NOTE\r\n\r\nThe above code is just a demonstration of the technique and there are issues with the above code swapping between room and non-room, which isn&#39;t required for the solution. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe core testing code :-\r\n\r\n        //Stage 1 load some data\r\n        getRoomDB();\r\n        mRowIdTestDao = mRTDB.rowIdTestDao();\r\n        mRowIdTestDao.insertManyRowIdTests(\r\n                new RowIdTest(&quot;A&quot;),\r\n                new RowIdTest(&quot;B&quot;),\r\n                new RowIdTest(&quot;C&quot;)\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        // Stage 2 close to room and dump sqlite_sequence\r\n        //mRTDB.close();\r\n        getNonRoomDB();\r\n        DatabaseUtils.dumpCursor(mNotRoomdb.query(&quot;sqlite_sequence&quot;,null,null,null,null,null,null));\r\n        mNotRoomdb.close();\r\n\r\n        //Stage 3 clear sqlite_sequence by dropping the table using SupportSQLiteDatabase\r\n        getRoomDB();\r\n        mSuppDB.execSQL(&quot;DROP TABLE RowIdTest&quot;); //&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; DROP THE TABLE\r\n        mSuppDB.execSQL(&quot;CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS RowIdTest (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, name TEXT)&quot;); //&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; CREATE THE TABLE\r\n\r\n        // Stage 4 close to room and dump sqlite_sequence\r\n        mRTDB.close();\r\n        getNonRoomDB();\r\n        DatabaseUtils.dumpCursor(mNotRoomdb.query(&quot;sqlite_sequence&quot;,null,null,null,null,null,null));\r\n        mNotRoomdb.close();\r\n\r\n        // Stage 5 check that all is OK again (add some rows)\r\n        getRoomDB();\r\n        mRowIdTestDao.insertManyRowIdTests(\r\n                new RowIdTest(&quot;A&quot;),\r\n                new RowIdTest(&quot;B&quot;),\r\n                new RowIdTest(&quot;C&quot;)\r\n        );\r\n        \r\n        DatabaseUtils.dumpCursor(mSuppDB.query(&quot;SELECT * FROM RowIdTest&quot;));\r\n\r\nThe called methods :-\r\n\r\n    RoomDatabase.Callback getSuppDb = new RoomDatabase.Callback() {\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onOpen(@NonNull SupportSQLiteDatabase db) {\r\n            super.onOpen(db);\r\n            mSuppDB = db;\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    private void getRoomDB() {\r\n        mRTDB = Room.databaseBuilder(this,RoomTestingDatabase.class,&quot;rtdb.db&quot;)\r\n                .allowMainThreadQueries()\r\n                .addCallback(getSuppDb)\r\n                .build();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void getNonRoomDB() {\r\n        mNotRoomdb = SQLiteDatabase.openDatabase(\r\n                this.getDatabasePath(&quot;rtdb.db&quot;).getPath(),\r\n                null,\r\n                SQLiteDatabase.OPEN_READWRITE\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n#Result from Log\r\n\r\n    2019-10-03 17:13:25.506 W/SQLiteConnection: Could not change the database journal mode of &#39;/data/user/0/art.roomtesting/databases/rtdb.db&#39; from &#39;wal&#39; to &#39;TRUNCATE&#39; because the database is locked.

I cant seem to find the documentation for this library (The library is org.json on maven).</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","spring-boot","arraylist"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":21130793,"reputation":34,"user_id":15535185,"display_name":"Matan Baruch"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1643923380,"creation_date":1643923380,"answer_id":70978488,"question_id":70978408,"body_markdown":"Try using a zip on the value lists to create a list of tuples containing the nth element of each.","title":"How to convert a JSON request into a list of specific format n spring?","body":"<p>Try using a zip on the value lists to create a list of tuples containing the nth element of each.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":10250466,"reputation":575,"user_id":7576519,"display_name":"Pablo Aragon&#233;s"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1644219824,"creation_date":1643977850,"answer_id":70986436,"question_id":70978408,"body_markdown":"As far as I can see, the result you want is a list of your DTO Class.\r\n\r\nFor this you would have to have a DTO Class like this one:\r\n```\r\npublic class TestRequest {\r\n    private String name;\r\n    private Integer count;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn example of the original DTO class could be:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class TestRequestDTO {\r\n    private Integer id;\r\n    private List&lt;String&gt; values;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result would be a list of your DTO Class like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        List&lt;TestRequestDTO&gt; dtoClassList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n        List&lt;TestRequest&gt; toReturn = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n        \r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; dtoClassList.size(); i++) {\r\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; dtoClassList.get(i).getValues().size(); j++) {\r\n                if (i+1 != dtoClassList.size()) {\r\n                    toReturn.add(TestRequest.builder()\r\n                            .name(dtoClassList.get(i).getValues().get(j))\r\n                            .count(dtoClassList.get(i + 1).getValues().get(j))\r\n                            .build());\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting request would be as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;a&quot;,\r\n        &quot;count&quot;: 1\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;b&quot;,\r\n        &quot;count&quot;: 2\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```","title":"How to convert a JSON request into a list of specific format n spring?","body":"<p>As far as I can see, the result you want is a list of your DTO Class.</p>\n<p>For this you would have to have a DTO Class like this one:</p>\n<pre><code>public class TestRequest {\n    private String name;\n    private Integer count;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>An example of the original DTO class could be:</p>\n<pre><code>public class TestRequestDTO {\n    private Integer id;\n    private List&lt;String&gt; values;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The result would be a list of your DTO Class like this:</p>\n<pre><code>        List&lt;TestRequestDTO&gt; dtoClassList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n        List&lt;TestRequest&gt; toReturn = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n        \n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; dtoClassList.size(); i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; dtoClassList.get(i).getValues().size(); j++) {\n                if (i+1 != dtoClassList.size()) {\n                    toReturn.add(TestRequest.builder()\n                            .name(dtoClassList.get(i).getValues().get(j))\n                            .count(dtoClassList.get(i + 1).getValues().get(j))\n                            .build());\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>The resulting request would be as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>[\n    {\n        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;a&quot;,\n        &quot;count&quot;: 1\n    },\n    {\n        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;b&quot;,\n        &quot;count&quot;: 2\n    }\n]\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"display_name":"user18843334"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1650858585,"creation_date":1650858585,"answer_id":71994354,"question_id":70978408,"body_markdown":"Your problem is to generate a set using members of two different sets in the original JSON file according to positions.

So I did an experiment, a casual benchmark test.\r\n\r\nFirst we create a 20 MB file of 40,000 `Person` records. Each `Person` holds a first &amp; last name in French, a [UUID][1], and some arbitrary text as a description. The data is written as four columns in a [CSV][2] file in [UTF-8][3]. I used the [*Apache Commons CSV*][4] library to write and read.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this written file is read. Each row of data is read into memory, then used to instantiate and collect a `Person` object. \r\n\r\nReading this file, and instantiating `Person` object for each row took **less than one second in total elapsed time**. Each row takes about 20K [nanoseconds][5]. Actually, this includes reading the file *twice*, as we do a scan to count the number of rows of data to set initial capacity of the collected instances. Also, we are parsing a hex string input into the 128-bit value of a [UUID][1], so we have some time spent on data-processing (not just reading).\r\n\r\nFor Java 16+, define `Person` class as a [record][6]. We override [`toString`][7] to avoid printing out the long `description` content.\r\n\r\n    record Person ( String givenName , String surname , UUID id , String description ) \r\n    {\r\n        static public  String LOREM_IPSUM = &quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

So I did an experiment, a casual benchmark test.</p>\n<p>First we create a 20 MB file of 40,000 <code>Person</code> records. Each <code>Person</code> holds a first &amp; last name in French, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">UUID</a>, and some arbitrary text as a description. The data is written as four columns in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CSV</a> file in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">UTF-8</a>. I used the <a href=\"https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Apache Commons CSV</em></a> library to write and read.</p>\n<p>Secondly, this written file is read. Each row of data is read into memory, then used to instantiate and collect a <code>Person</code> object.</p>\n<p>Reading this file, and instantiating <code>Person</code> object for each row took <strong>less than one second in total elapsed time</strong>. Each row takes about 20K <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosecond\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">nanoseconds</a>. Actually, this includes reading the file <em>twice</em>, as we do a scan to count the number of rows of data to set initial capacity of the collected instances. Also, we are parsing a hex string input into the 128-bit value of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">UUID</a>, so we have some time spent on data-processing (not just reading).</p>\n<p>For Java 16+, define <code>Person</code> class as a <a href=\"https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/395\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">record</a>. We override <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html#toString()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>toString</code></a> to avoid printing out the long <code>description</code> content.</p>\n<pre><code>record Person ( String givenName , String surname , UUID id , String description ) \n{\n    static public  String LOREM_IPSUM = &quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Third is <a href=\"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/tree/master/csv\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>Jackson</code></a> which I personally prefer. Using <code>@Basil Bourque</code> great example I changed it a little bit and used <code>Jackson</code> classes. Method read returns <code>MappingIterator</code> which you can use to initialise your heap object (see how I added elements to <code>List</code>).
