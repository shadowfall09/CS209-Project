In general I like the terseness of using ofNullable over if/else statements, but I can't use them in critical code paths due to heavy GC.</p>\n<p>Edit:  Here's the benchmarking code I used:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@BenchmarkOptions(benchmarkRounds = 100, warmupRounds = 20)\npublic class BenchmarkTest {\n    @Rule\n    public TestRule benchmarkRun = new BenchmarkRule();\n\n    public static Integer[] ARRAY;\n\n    /** Prepare random numbers for tests. */\n    @BeforeClass\n    public static void beforeClass() {\n        ARRAY = new Integer[10000000];\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10000000; i++)\n            ARRAY[i] = i % 2 == 0 ? null : i;\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void test1() throws Exception {\n        TestClass x = new TestClass();\n        for (int a = 0; a &lt; ARRAY.length; a++) {\n            x.test1(ARRAY[a]);\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void test2() throws Exception {\n        TestClass x = new TestClass();\n        for (int a = 0; a &lt; ARRAY.length; a++) {\n            x.test2(ARRAY[a]);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","list","recursion"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":11624106,"reputation":2811,"user_id":11808788,"display_name":"Charles"},"score":0,"creation_date":1645459528,"post_id":71209354,"comment_id":125871363,"body_markdown":"I don&#39;t think you even need recursion for this.

The `count()` method is incorrectly counting adjacent -1s surrounding any position I put in `main()`\r\n 2. `setCounts()` goes out of bounds after printing a random number of rows\r\n\r\nI am certain that it has to do with this block of code:\r\n```\r\nif(newR &lt; 0 || newR &gt;= array.length &amp;&amp; newC &lt; 0 || newC &gt;= array[0].length)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinue;\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\tif(array[newR][newC] == -1)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tvalue++;\r\n```\r\nWhen I printed `newR` and `newC` in the loop after `continue`, the loop is randomly adding more numbers to a row/column combo with no direct pattern for the entire output when `count()` was called in `setCounts()`:\r\n```\r\n00\r\n11\r\n11\r\n00\r\n11\r\n 0 01\r\n12\r\n12\r\n01\r\n12\r\n 0 02\r\n13\r\n13\r\n02\r\n13\r\n 0 03\r\n14\r\n14\r\n03\r\n14\r\n 3 04\r\n15\r\n15\r\n04\r\n15\r\n 0 -1 -1 -1 -1 09\r\n09\r\n 0 \r\n-1 00\r\n...\r\n```\r\nSo taking the print statements out, I get this as an output:\r\n```0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 -1 0 0 \r\n0 -1 -1 0 -1 -1 -1 0 0 0 \r\n0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 \r\n0 -1 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \r\n0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 \r\n-1 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 \r\n0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 -1 0 0 \r\n0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 -1 0 \r\n0 0 0 0 -1 -1 0 0 0 0 \r\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \r\nthere are 0 -1s\r\n-----------\r\n 3  3  0 -1  3  3  0 -1  0  0 \r\n\r\n/* Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index -1 out of bounds for length 10\r\n\tat Grid3.count(Grid3.java:44)\r\n\tat Grid3.setCounts(Grid3.java:58)\r\n\tat Grid3.main(Grid3.java:86) */\r\n```\r\nThe first array is the array I make with `Grid`&#39;s constructor. The second array that the program is trying to print is being done when `setCounts()` is called.\r\n\r\nI was thinking that changing it to:\r\n```\r\nif(newR &lt; 0 || newR &gt;= array.length)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcontinue;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tif(newC &lt; 0 || newC &gt;= array[0].length)\r\n\t\t\t\t    continue;\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\t\tif(array[newR][newC] == -1)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tvalue++;\r\n```\r\nwould work: and it does, but not logically. It gets rid of the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` error, but logically does not work since it doesn&#39;t count adjacent -1&#39;s right. It also seems to be adding more numbers randomly to any row/column combo. I put the position as `(5, 5)` in `main()` and one time I ran the code, it counted `6` -1s but there are only `3` -1s in the position I put:\r\n```\r\n-1 0 0 0 0 -1 0 -1 0 0 \r\n0 0 0 0 -1 -1 0 0 0 0 \r\n0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \r\n0 -1 0 -1 -1 0 0 -1 -1 0 \r\n0 0 0 -1 -1 -1 0 0 0 0 \r\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \r\n-1 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 \r\n0 -1 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 \r\n0 -1 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 \r\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \r\nthere are 6 -1s\r\n```\r\nAnd for `setCounts()`, it printed a full 10x10 2d array but does not count -1s properly either. For the position `(0, 0)` (in this case, the `3` at the top left corner of the output shown below), that position should actually have a value of 2 since there are only 2 adjacent -1s, but it actually counts 3.\r\n```\r\n 3  0  0  0  0  0 -1  0  0  0 \r\n-1 -1  0  3  0  0  0 -1  0  0 \r\n-1  3  6  3 -1  0  3  0  3  0 \r\n 0  3  0 -1 -1 -1  0 -1  0  0 \r\n 3  0  0  0 -1  3  6  3  3  0 \r\n 3 -1  0  0  0  3  0 -1 -1  0 \r\n-1 -1  3  0  0  0  0  3  3  3 \r\n 0  6  6  0  3  0  0  0 -1  0 \r\n 0  0 -1 -1  0 -1  0  0  0  3 \r\n 0  0  0  3  3  0  3  0  0  0 \r\n```\r\nHere is a full output:\r\n```\r\n0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 \r\n0 -1 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 \r\n0 -1 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 \r\n0 0 -1 -1 -1 0 0 -1 0 0 \r\n0 0 0 0 0 -1 -1 0 -1 0 \r\n-1 0 0 -1 0 -1 0 0 0 0 \r\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 \r\n0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 \r\n0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 -1 0 \r\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \r\nthere are 2 -1&#39;s\r\n-----------\r\n 3  0  0  3  0  0 -1  0  0  0 \r\n 3 -1  0  0 -1  0  0  3  0  0 \r\n 0 -1  6  3  0 -1  3  0  0  0 \r\n 0  0 -1 -1 -1  3  3 -1  0  0 \r\n 0  0  3  3  6 -1 -1  0 -1  0 \r\n-1  0  0 -1  0 -1  3  6  0  3 \r\n 3  3  0  0  3  0  3  3 -1  0 \r\n 0 -1  0  0  0  3  0  3 -1  3 \r\n 0  0  3  0  0  0 -1  0 -1  3 \r\n 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  3  0  3 \r\n```\r\nI cannot figure out what I&#39;m doing wrong. I need `count()` to properly count adjacent -1s given a position. If it doesn&#39;t count adjacent -1s properly, then `setCounts()` will not logically work. What should I change in either or both methods so that it properly and logically works?

The StackPanels are the Nodes of the HBox, and were added based on an Array, not through a xfml file. The HBox is inside a VBox, which contains 3 other elements that are irrelevant here.</p>\n<p>My objective is to switch two of those nodes using an animation, which I created with a PathTransition that has a Path of an Arc. I have two such animations running at the same time, one for the Node going to the destination, and one for the other one coming to the current location.</p>\n<p>After the animation is completed, I use the switchNode() function to switch the two nodes, as I want their order to change, as I want to continue performing animations, and the animation itself does not change their order, only location.

simple wordle game just to get the hang of GUI in Java. The idea is the program picks a random 5 letter word from a text file and the user gets 6 guesses to guess the word. If he guesses the correct letter in the right place the background panel will turn green, and if he guesses the correct letter but in the wrong spot it will turn yellow. But I'm having trouble with the <code>JTextField</code>, both in that it pops up under the panels and in the wrong place (included image). I tried adding the text field in a <code>JPanel</code> and the panel to the frame but that did not help.</p>\n<p>I have no idea why this is happening or how to fix it. Does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing?</p>\n<p>Here is the code:</p>\n<pre><code>import java.awt.Color;\n\npublic class WordleFrame extends JFrame implements ActionListener {\n
