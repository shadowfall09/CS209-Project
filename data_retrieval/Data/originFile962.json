The command line call looks as following:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>Liquibase --changeLogFile=C:\\myProject\\src\\main\\resources\\database\\master.xml  --logLevel=DEBUG rollbackCount 5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My liquibase.properties file looks as following: </p>\n\n<pre><code>driver: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver \nclasspath:ojdbc6.jar \nurl: jdbc:oracle:thin:@192.168.56.101:1521:orcl\nusername: myUser\npassword: mypassword\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The question does some know why does this happens? Are there any incompatibilties between SDK and cmd tool? </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","spring-boot","exception"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":11252448,"reputation":3639,"user_id":8253209,"display_name":"Matt Ke"},"score":0,"creation_date":1665741257,"post_id":74064498,"comment_id":130774024,"body_markdown":"Does this answer your question?

If I then press &lt;kbd&gt;free&lt;/kbd&gt; button, `rectanglebtn` is still `12` \r\n\r\nInstead of using two different (and somewhat unrelated) variables, you should be using a single &quot;state&quot; variable.  Now, if you have more than two states, I would use a `enum`, for example...\r\n\r\n    enum State {\r\n        FREE, RECTANGLE, CIRCLE\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd then update the action handler to something like...\r\n\r\n        private State state = null;\r\n\r\n        // action listener-------------------------------\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\r\n\r\n            // TODO Auto-generated method stub\r\n            if (&quot;free&quot;.equals(e.getActionCommand())) {\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;free button&quot;);\r\n\r\n                state = State.FREE;\r\n            } else if (&quot;rectangle&quot;.equals(e.getActionCommand())) {\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;rectangle button&quot;);\r\n                state = State.RECTANGLE;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\nNow, whenever either button is actioned, the `state` is changed to a single state.\r\n\r\nThen your mouse listener begins to look something more like...\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {\r\n            // TODO Auto-generated method stub\r\n            \r\n            System.out.println(state);\r\n            if (state == State.RECTANGLE) {\r\n\r\n                g.setColor(Color.BLUE);\r\n                g.drawRect(e.getX(), e.getY(), 100, 50);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // mouse motion listener---------------------------\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) {\r\n            // TODO Auto-generated method stub\r\n            System.out.println(state);\r\n            if (state == State.FREE) {\r\n\r\n                g.setColor(Color.BLUE);\r\n                g.fillOval(e.getX(), e.getY(), 20, 20);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\nand there is no way that they could become cross wired.\r\n\r\nNow, onto the &quot;other&quot; issues... `g = bottom.getGraphics();` is NOT how custom painting works.  At best, this will return a &quot;snapshot&quot; of what was last painted and at worst, it will return `null`.\r\n\r\nYou need to look at [Painting in AWT and Swing](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/painting.html) and [Performing Custom Painting](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/painting/index.html) to get a better understanding of how painting in Swing works and how you should work with it.","title":"Why is the mousedrag and mousepress being used together in the same time ?

Now, if you have more than two states, I would use a <code>enum</code>, for example...</p>\n<pre><code>enum State {\n    FREE, RECTANGLE, CIRCLE\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then update the action handler to something like...</p>\n<pre><code>    private State state = null;\n\n    // action listener-------------------------------\n    @Override\n    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        if (&quot;free&quot;.equals(e.getActionCommand())) {\n            System.out.println(&quot;free button&quot;);\n\n            state = State.FREE;\n        } else if (&quot;rectangle&quot;.equals(e.getActionCommand())) {\n            System.out.println(&quot;rectangle button&quot;);\n            state = State.RECTANGLE;\n        }\n\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, whenever either button is actioned, the <code>state</code> is changed to a single state.</p>\n<p>Then your mouse listener begins to look something more like...</p>\n<pre><code>    @Override\n    public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        \n        System.out.println(state);\n        if (state == State.RECTANGLE) {\n\n            g.setColor(Color.BLUE);\n            g.drawRect(e.getX(), e.getY(), 100, 50);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // mouse motion listener---------------------------\n    @Override\n    public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) {\n        // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n        System.out.println(state);\n        if (state == State.FREE) {\n\n            g.setColor(Color.BLUE);\n            g.fillOval(e.getX(), e.getY(), 20, 20);\n        }\n\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>and there is no way that they could become cross wired.</p>\n<p>Now, onto the &quot;other&quot; issues... <code>g = bottom.getGraphics();</code> is NOT how custom painting works.  At best, this will return a &quot;snapshot&quot; of what was last painted and at worst, it will return <code>null</code>.</p>\n<p>You need to look at <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/painting.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Painting in AWT and Swing</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/painting/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Performing Custom Painting</a> to get a better understanding of how painting in Swing works and how you should work with it.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":21697406,"reputation":13,"user_id":16011079,"display_name":"Ali Haydar"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":74063048,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1665733240,"creation_date":1665703437,"question_id":74062810,"body_markdown":"When I press the free button I can draw in the bottom pane but when I press the rectangle button I can draw a rectangle in the panel but I can also draw anything in the same time.

I think this is some implementation detail in JAXB.</p>\n\n<p>The other solution is to create a base type for a <code>BioSampleSet</code> and use that at both locations like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;xs:element name=\"ProjectTypeSubmission\"&gt;\n\n...\n\n  &lt;xs:element name=\"Target\"&gt;\n\n    ...\n\n    &lt;xs:element name=\"BioSampleSet\" type=\"typeBioSampleSet\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"1\"/&gt;\n\n    ...\n\n  &lt;/xs:element&gt;\n\n  ...\n\n  &lt;xs:element name=\"TargetBioSampleSet\" type=\"typeBioSampleSet\"/&gt;\n\n  ...\n\n&lt;xs:element/&gt;\n\n...\n\n&lt;xs:complexType name=\"typeBioSampleSet\"&gt;\n  &lt;xs:sequence&gt;\n    &lt;xs:element name=\"ID\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\" type=\"xs:token\"&gt;&lt;/xs:element&gt;\n  &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;\n&lt;/xs:complexType&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The best solution would be to drop every anonymous type declarations from your schema. If you can do that, do it, because this schema looks like a mess (to me at least).</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":13431810,"reputation":189,"user_id":9691439,"display_name":"vks"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":9,"is_accepted":false,"score":9,"last_activity_date":1575541762,"creation_date":1575538354,"answer_id":59192017,"question_id":13422253,"body_markdown":"remove

E.g. having an input list size of 200 with an &#39;r&#39; value of 5 will return a value of 2.5 billion - which is already above the max list size. \r\n\r\nOne way I&#39;ve thought of to get around this is to split the input list into manageable chunks before I pass it to the combinatorial function: \r\n\r\n\r\n    // inputPoints is a List&lt;Point&gt; type\r\n    List&lt;List&lt;Point&gt;&gt; inputSplits = Helper.splitInputList(inputPoints) ; // splits input points list so that each subList is a maximum of say 100 in size.\r\n    \r\n    List&lt;List&lt;List&lt;Point&gt;&gt;&gt; outputSplit;\r\n    \r\n    for(var inputListSplit : inputListSplits){\r\n      outputSplit.Add(getCombinations(inputListSplit); // each result will be a List with size smaller than integer.MaxValue. \r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis can work but is inelegant.

","title":"Factorial Combinations - Getting around list size limitation in Java","body":"<p>I have a rather interesting problem - I'm given an input list of points in 3d space and I'm required to output a collection of combinations of these points using the factorial combination equation below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YCITB.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YCITB.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>where n is the size of the input list of points, and r is the combination length.</p>\n<p>For the output, I'm required to produce a list of lists with the sub-list containing the chosen points (size of each sublist being r, and the size of the parent list is the output of 'n choose r')</p>\n<p>The problem is that given large enough values of n and r, I start running into the INTEGER.MAXVALUE size limitation for lists in java. E.g. having an input list size of 200 with an 'r' value of 5 will return a value of 2.5 billion - which is already above the max list size.</p>\n<p>One way I've thought of to get around this is to split the input list into manageable chunks before I pass it to the combinatorial function:</p>\n<pre><code>// inputPoints is a List&lt;Point&gt; type\nList&lt;List&lt;Point&gt;&gt; inputSplits = Helper.splitInputList(inputPoints) ; // splits input points list so that each subList is a maximum of say 100 in size.\n\nList&lt;List&lt;List&lt;Point&gt;&gt;&gt; outputSplit;\n\nfor(var inputListSplit : inputListSplits){\n  outputSplit.Add(getCombinations(inputListSplit); // each result will be a List with size smaller than integer.MaxValue. \n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This can work but is inelegant. I've also thought of using linked lists (which apparently don't have a size limit) but haven't looked into the pros and cons of that just yet.</p>\n<p>Are there any other ways this could be tackled ?
