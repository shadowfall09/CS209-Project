See [JEP 220: Modular Run-Time Images][4] for more information about `jrt` URLs.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;The following example grants permission to read the `foo` property to the module `com.greetings`:\r\n&gt;```none\r\n&gt;grant codeBase &quot;jrt:/com.greetings&quot; {\r\n&gt;    permission java.util.PropertyPermission &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;read&quot;;\r\n&gt;};\r\n&gt;```\r\n&gt;\r\n\r\nFrom [JEP 200: The Modular JDK][5]:\r\n\r\n&gt;_**Design principles**_\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;The modular structure of the JDK implements the following principles:\r\n&gt; * Standard modules, whose specifications are governed by the JCP, have names starting with the string `&quot;java.&quot;`.\r\n&gt; * All other modules are merely part of the JDK, and have names starting with the string `&quot;jdk.&quot;`.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;_[...]_\r\n\r\nFrom [JEP 220: Modular Run-Time Images][4]:\r\n\r\n&gt;### Summary\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Restructure the JDK and JRE run-time images to accommodate modules and to improve performance, security, and maintainability. Define a new URI scheme for naming the modules, classes, and resources stored in a run-time image without revealing the internal structure or format of the image. Revise existing specifications as required to accommodate these changes.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;_[...]_\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;**_Removed: rt.jar and tools.jar_**\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;The class and resource files previously stored in `lib/rt.jar`, `lib/tools.jar`, `lib/dt.jar`, and various other internal JAR files are now stored in a more efficient format in implementation-specific files in the `lib` directory. The format of these files is not specified and is subject to change without notice.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;The removal of `rt.jar` and similar files leads to three distinct problems:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;1. _[...]_\r\n&gt;2. The `java.security.CodeSource` API and security-policy files use URLs to name the locations of code bases that are to be granted specified permissions. Components of the run-time system that require specific permissions are currently identified in the `lib/security/java.policy` file via file URLs. The elliptic-curve cryptography provider, e.g., is identified as\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;    &gt; ```none\r\n&gt;    &gt; file:${java.home}/lib/ext/sunec.jar\r\n&gt;    &gt; ```\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;    which, obviously, has no meaning in a modular image.\r\n&gt;3. _[...]_\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;**_New URI scheme for naming stored modules, classes, and resources_**\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;To address the above three problems a new URL scheme, `jrt`, can be used to name the modules, classes, and resources stored in a run-time image without revealing the internal structure or format of the image.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;A `jrt` URL is a hierarchical URI, per RFC 3986, with the syntax\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;```none\r\n&gt;jrt:/[$MODULE[/$PATH]]\r\n&gt;```\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;where `$MODULE` is an optional module name and `$PATH`, if present, is the path to a specific class or resource file within that module. The meaning of a `jrt` URL depends upon its structure:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; * _[...]_\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; * `jrt:/$MODULE` refers to all of the class and resource files in the module `$MODULE`.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; * _[...]_\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;These three forms of `jrt` URLs address the above problems as follows:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; 1. _[...]_\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; 2. Security-policy files and other uses of the `CodeSource` API can use `jrt` URLs to name specific modules for the purpose of granting permissions. The elliptic-curve cryptography provider, e.g., can now be identified by the `jrt` URL\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;    ```none\r\n&gt;    jrt:/jdk.crypto.ec\r\n&gt;    ```\r\n&gt;    Other modules that are currently granted all permissions but do not actually require them can trivially be de-privileged, i.e., given precisely the permissions they require.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; 3. _[...]_\r\n\r\nBoth _JEP 200_ and _JEP 220_ were part of [Project Jigsaw][3].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/users/4014509/sebastian-s\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/users/14731/gili\r\n  [3]: https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/\r\n  [4]: https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/220\r\n  [5]: https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/200\r\n  [6]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/jdk.jstatd/module-summary.html\r\n  [7]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/index.html\r\n  [8]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/security/permissions-jdk1.html#GUID-7450CEFD-8EDC-495E-A7A3-6C2561FA4999\r\n  [9]: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/19-relnote-issues.html#JDK-8272317\r\n","title":"Starting jstatd in Java 9+","body":"<p><strong>Java 19 Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/19-relnote-issues.html#JDK-8272317\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Release Notes - <code>jstatd</code> No Longer Requires a SecurityManager (JDK-8272317)</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>jstatd</code> no longer requires a Security Manager and policy file.

The model should be observable in some way so that the view/controller can react to changes in the model by updating the view. With the model being shared and observed, updating it from one window will be seen by the other window.\r\n\r\n## Models\r\n\r\nNote a model should not know about the view. In your code, you do:\r\n\r\n&gt; ```lang-java\r\n&gt; game_logic game_logic = new game_logic(chess_board);\r\n&gt; ```\r\n\r\nFrom the name of the class, this indicates you&#39;re passing a `GridPane` (the view) to your model. It would be better if your model only _modelled_ a chess game. The controller/view is responsible for translating that state into a visual representation.\r\n\r\n## Rotating the Second View\r\n\r\nThe simplest approach to this would be to add state/a method to your controller, and then only on the second instance of the controller configure it to rotate the view. It is at least somewhat justifiable to put this logic in the controller/view because it is only a view thing (it does not affect the game state).\r\n\r\nThough instead of rotating the board, you might want to consider &quot;inverting&quot; the location of the pieces (vertically). In other words, for the second view, have it so that a white piece in the bottom-left corner of the board is actually _displayed_ in the top-left corner (and the opposite for black pieces). That way the chess piece images are not rotated along with the rest of the board.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Example\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a proof-of-concept for mirroring a draggable rectangle (much simpler than a chess game). Note it only demonstrates the mirroring, it does not show how to e.g., rotate the view in one window but not the other.\r\n\r\n`RectangleModel.java`:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\npackage sample;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\nimport java.util.Objects;\r\nimport java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList;\r\nimport java.util.function.Consumer;\r\n\r\npublic class RectangleModel {\r\n\r\n    private final List&lt;Consumer&lt;? super Dimensions&gt;&gt;

(Mirroring)","body":"<h1>Share the Model</h1>\n<p>Since you want to mirror between two windows in the same process, the general idea is to create two instances of your view but share only one instance of the model. The model should be observable in some way so that the view/controller can react to changes in the model by updating the view. With the model being shared and observed, updating it from one window will be seen by the other window.</p>\n<h2>Models</h2>\n<p>Note a model should not know about the view. In your code, you do:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>game_logic game_logic = new game_logic(chess_board);\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From the name of the class, this indicates you're passing a <code>GridPane</code> (the view) to your model. It would be better if your model only <em>modelled</em> a chess game. The controller/view is responsible for translating that state into a visual representation.</p>\n<h2>Rotating the Second View</h2>\n<p>The simplest approach to this would be to add state/a method to your controller, and then only on the second instance of the controller configure it to rotate the view. It is at least somewhat justifiable to put this logic in the controller/view because it is only a view thing (it does not affect the game state).</p>\n<p>Though instead of rotating the board, you might want to consider &quot;inverting&quot; the location of the pieces (vertically). In other words, for the second view, have it so that a white piece in the bottom-left corner of the board is actually <em>displayed</em> in the top-left corner (and the opposite for black pieces). That way the chess piece images are not rotated along with the rest of the board.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Example</h1>\n<p>Here's a proof-of-concept for mirroring a draggable rectangle (much simpler than a chess game). Note it only demonstrates the mirroring, it does not show how to e.g., rotate the view in one window but not the other.</p>\n<p><code>RectangleModel.java</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>package sample;\n\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Objects;\nimport java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList;\nimport java.util.function.Consumer;\n\npublic class RectangleModel {\n\n    private final List&lt;Consumer&lt;? super Dimensions&gt;&gt;

Whereas executing add() method inside a loop doesn't have that much JMH code in between?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xijYx.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xijYx.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android-studio","fusedlocationproviderapi"],"owner":{"account_id":25999845,"reputation":1,"user_id":19710561,"display_name":"Vani Garg"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1672820342,"creation_date":1672820342,"question_id":75002656,"body_markdown":"```\r\n @Override\r\n    public void onConnected(@Nullable Bundle bundle) {\r\n\r\n\r\n        if (ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED &amp;&amp; ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {\r\n            // TODO: Consider calling\r\n            //    ActivityCompat#requestPermissions\r\n            // here to request the missing permissions, and then overriding\r\n            //   public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, String[] permissions,\r\n            //                                          int[] grantResults)\r\n            // to handle the case where the user grants the permission.
