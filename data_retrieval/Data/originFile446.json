The new classes are inspired by the highly successful [Joda-Time](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) framework, intended as its successor, similar in concept but re-architected. Defined by [JSR 310](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310). Extended by the [ThreeTen-Extra](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/) project. See the [Tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/TOC.html).\r\n\r\n## Moment\r\n\r\nThe [`Instant`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html) class represents a moment on the timeline in [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) with a resolution of [nanoseconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosecond) (up to nine (9) digits of a decimal fraction). \r\n\r\n    Instant instant = Instant.now() ;  // Capture current moment in UTC.\r\n\r\nBest to avoid the legacy classes such as `Date`/`Calendar`. But if you must inter-operate with old code not yet updated to *java.time*, convert back and forth. Call new conversion methods added to the old classes. For moving from a [`java.util.Date`][3] to an [`Instant`][4], call [`Date::toInstant`][5]. \r\n\r\n    Instant instant = myJavaUtilDate.toInstant() ;  // Convert from legacy `java.util.Date` class to modern `java.time.Instant` class.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Span of time\r\n\r\nThe java.time classes have split this idea of representing a span of time as a number of years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds into two halves:\r\n\r\n - [`Period`][6] for years, months, days\r\n - [`Duration`][7] for days, hours, minutes, seconds\r\n\r\nHere is an example.\r\n\r\n    ZoneId zoneId = ZoneId.of ( &quot;America/Montreal&quot; );\r\n    ZonedDateTime now = ZonedDateTime.now ( zoneId );\r\n    ZonedDateTime future = now.plusMinutes ( 63 );\r\n    Duration duration = Duration.between ( now , future );\r\n\r\nDump to console.\r\n\r\nBoth `Period` and `Duration` use the [ISO 8601][2] standard for generating a String representation of their value.\r\n\r\n    System.out.println ( &quot;now: &quot; + now + &quot; to future: &quot; + now + &quot; = &quot; + duration );\r\n\r\n&gt;now: 2015-11-26T00:46:48.016-05:00[America/Montreal] to future: 2015-11-26T00:46:48.016-05:00[America/Montreal] = PT1H3M\r\n\r\nJava 9 adds methods to `Duration` to get the days part, hours part, minutes part, and seconds part.\r\n\r\nYou can get the total number of days or hours or minutes or seconds or milliseconds or nanoseconds in the entire Duration.\r\n\r\n    long totalHours = duration.toHours();\r\n\r\nIn Java 9 the [`Duration` class gets new methods][8] for returning the various parts of days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds/nanoseconds. Call the `to…Part` methods: `toDaysPart()`, `toHoursPart()`, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n# `ChronoUnit`\r\n\r\nIf you only care about a simpler larger granularity of time, such as “number of days elapsed”, use the [`ChronoUnit`][9] enum.\r\n\r\n    long daysElapsed = ChronoUnit.DAYS.between( earlier , later );\r\n\r\nAnother example.\r\n\r\n    Instant now = Instant.now();\r\n    Instant later = now.plus( Duration.ofHours( 2 ) );\r\n    …\r\n    long minutesElapsed = ChronoUnit.MINUTES.between( now , later );\r\n\r\n&gt;120\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n# About java.time\r\n\r\nThe [java.time](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html) framework is built into Java 8 and later. These classes supplant the troublesome old [legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system) date-time classes such as [`java.util.Date`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Date.html), [`Calendar`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html), &amp; [`SimpleDateFormat`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html).\r\n\r\nThe [Joda-Time](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) project, now in [maintenance mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_mode), advises migration to java.time.\r\n\r\nTo learn more, see the [Oracle Tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/TOC.html). And search Stack Overflow for many examples and explanations.

This project is a proving ground for possible future additions to java.time. You may find some useful classes here such as [`Interval`](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/Interval.html), [`YearWeek`](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/YearWeek.html), [`YearQuarter`](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/YearQuarter.html), and [more](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/index.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n# Joda-Time\r\n\r\nUPDATE: The [Joda-Time](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) project is now in [maintenance mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_mode), with the team advising migration to the [java.time](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html) classes.

It is less &quot;destructive&quot; than `Math.round` because it doesn&#39;t alter values under several conditions (see below).\r\n\r\n&gt;The behavior of this method follows IEEE Standard 754, section 4. This kind of rounding is sometimes called rounding to nearest, or banker&#39;s rounding. It minimizes rounding errors that result from consistently rounding a midpoint value in a single direction.\r\n\r\n(From [Jon Skeet&#39;s answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/977807) in C#. The behavior of Math.Round in C# is more similar to Java&#39;s `Math.rint`, as confusing as that may be.)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the [docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html):\r\n\r\n&gt;     static double rint(double a)\r\n&gt;Returns the double value that is closest in value to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Returns the double value that is closest in value to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer. If two double values that are mathematical integers are equally close, the result is the integer value that is even. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Special cases:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;- If the argument value is already equal to a mathematical integer, then the result is the same as the argument.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;- If the argument is NaN or an infinity or positive zero or negative zero, then the result is the same as the argument.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n&gt;     static long round(double a)\r\n&gt;...\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;     static int round(float a)\r\n&gt;Returns the closest int to the argument, with ties rounding up.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Special cases:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;- If the argument is NaN, the result is 0.\r\n&gt;- If the argument is negative infinity or any value less than or equal to the value of Integer.MIN_VALUE, the result is equal to the value of Integer.MIN_VALUE.\r\n&gt;- If the argument is positive infinity or any value greater than or equal to the value of Integer.MAX_VALUE, the result is equal to the value of Integer.MAX_VALUE.\r\n\r\nYou can also change the behavior of `Math.round` via [RoundingMode][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt;     public enum RoundingMode\r\n&gt;     extends Enum&lt;RoundingMode&gt;\r\n&gt;Specifies a *rounding behavior* for numerical operations capable of discarding precision. Each rounding mode indicates how the least significant returned digit of a rounded result is to be calculated. If fewer digits are returned than the digits needed to represent the exact numerical result, the discarded digits will be referred to as the discarded fraction regardless the digits&#39; contribution to the value of the number.
