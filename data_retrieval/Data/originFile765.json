I made it work in some way, but it&#39;s not the soulution that I&#39;d say I want.\r\n\r\nBack reference is needed because each `Price` gets some data from `Article` while being indexed by Hibernate Search.\r\n\r\nJoin column gives me an option to have only two tables, avoiding 3rd linking table.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Entity @Indexed\r\nclass Article {\r\n    \r\n    String name;\r\n\r\n    @JsonManagedReference\t\r\n\t@OneToMany \r\n    @LazyCollection(org.hibernate.annotations.LazyCollectionOption.EXTRA)\r\n\t@JoinColumn(name = &quot;article_id&quot;)\r\n\t@Field(...bridge = @FieldBridge(impl = PriceBridge.class))\r\n    Set&lt;Price&gt; prices;\r\n\r\n    private User created;\r\n    private User updated;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Entity @Indexed\r\nclass Price {\r\n\r\n    @Reference @JsonBackReference\r\n\t@ManyToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY)\r\n\t@Field(...bridge = @FieldBridge(impl = PriceArticleBridge.class))\r\n\tprivate Article article;\r\n\r\n    @ManyToOne private Provider provider;\r\n\r\n    @ManyToOne private CustomCurrency currency;\r\n\r\n    private BigDecimal amount;\r\n\r\n    private User created;\r\n    private User updated;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis setup gives me 2 tables where `Price` table has `article_id` and there is no 3rd table for linking purposes. But while loading `Article` and issuing `prices.size()`, the whole collection is fetched. This is not good because many other entities are loaded too: `Provider` from `Price` and `User` many times because `Provider` also has its own 2 properties of `User` to track creator and updater.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen there is no `@JoinColumn`, 3rd linking table is created and then it starts to use `COUNT()` instead of loading the whole collection.\r\n\r\n**My only question is:**\r\nHow can I keep only 2 tables and use `.size()` without loading the whole collection?\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\n**SQL example when not having `@JoinColumn`:**\r\n```\r\nselect count(prices_id) from article_prices

I made it work in some way, but it's not the soulution that I'd say I want.</p>\n<p>Back reference is needed because each <code>Price</code> gets some data from <code>Article</code> while being indexed by Hibernate Search.</p>\n<p>Join column gives me an option to have only two tables, avoiding 3rd linking table.</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity @Indexed\nclass Article {\n    \n    String name;\n\n    @JsonManagedReference   \n    @OneToMany \n    @LazyCollection(org.hibernate.annotations.LazyCollectionOption.EXTRA)\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;article_id&quot;)\n    @Field(...bridge = @FieldBridge(impl = PriceBridge.class))\n    Set&lt;Price&gt; prices;\n\n    private User created;\n    private User updated;\n}\n\n@Entity @Indexed\nclass Price {\n\n    @Reference @JsonBackReference\n    @ManyToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY)\n    @Field(...bridge = @FieldBridge(impl = PriceArticleBridge.class))\n    private Article article;\n\n    @ManyToOne private Provider provider;\n\n    @ManyToOne private CustomCurrency currency;\n\n    private BigDecimal amount;\n\n    private User created;\n    private User updated;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This setup gives me 2 tables where <code>Price</code> table has <code>article_id</code> and there is no 3rd table for linking purposes. But while loading <code>Article</code> and issuing <code>prices.size()</code>, the whole collection is fetched. This is not good because many other entities are loaded too: <code>Provider</code> from <code>Price</code> and <code>User</code> many times because <code>Provider</code> also has its own 2 properties of <code>User</code> to track creator and updater.</p>\n<p>When there is no <code>@JoinColumn</code>, 3rd linking table is created and then it starts to use <code>COUNT()</code> instead of loading the whole collection.</p>\n<p><strong>My only question is:</strong>\nHow can I keep only 2 tables and use <code>.size()</code> without loading the whole collection?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>SQL example

In answer to:\r\n\r\n    &gt; Is this new way of building images everyone is talking about good only for very basic Dockerfile?\r\n\r\n    No. Dockerfiles are a generic way to build images, which work for many, many different situations. Buildpacks do not attempt to replace Dockerfiles for every use case. The target area for buildpacks is packaging your applications into container images. If you deploy with Docker or Kubernetes or some other container orchestrator then Buildpacks should work very well for you.\r\n\r\n4. In answer to:\r\n\r\n    &gt; How may I change the base image\r\n\r\n    With buildpacks you have a base build image and a base run image. The base build image is the base container image that is used when buildpacks run and your application compiles. The base run image is what is used by your application when it executes. The build is often larger than the base as you have more dev tools and libraries there.\r\n\r\n    You can change both. To change the build image, you must change the builder. That is the `&lt;builder&gt;` tag in your Spring Boot build tools configuration or the `-B` flag for `pack build`. The builder contains the base build image plus all of the buildpacks. It also has metadata to indicate the run image that pairs with the build image. If you make a custom builder image, you can control all of those things in as much detail as you want, you just need to ensure that the buildpacks you&#39;re using are compatible with the build and run image you create. [Instructions for creating a builder can be found here](https://buildpacks.io/docs/operator-guide/create-a-builder/).\r\n\r\n    If you only need to change the run image, that can be done a little easier. You can [set the `&lt;runImage&gt;` config setting](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/3.0.1/maven-plugin/reference/htmlsingle/#build-image.customization) in your Spring Boot build tools and it&#39;ll override the run image suggested by the builder.\r\n\r\n    You need to be careful when doing this because you need to ensure that the application built with the build image will run on the run image you specify. The two are usually paired so that any libraries necessary to run the application are present at runtime. For Java apps, this is generally easy since there are not a lot of system dependencies. However, you could not set the run image to `scratch` because the JVM does have a couple of system dependencies.\r\n\r\n    You might be thinking, &quot;how would I create these images?&quot; and the answer is a Dockerfile. As mentioned before, Buildpacks are not attempting to completely replace Dockerfiles, just make certain use cases easier. This is a use case, making base images, where Dockerfiles work fine, so you can `docker build` your own base builder and run images. See [here for more detailed instructions](https://buildpacks.io/docs/operator-guide/create-a-stack/).\r\n\r\n    The process to create your own build/run images is not technically difficult or time consuming, but it does require automation because you *must* keep those images up-to-date so you are getting relevant security fixes.\r\n\r\n    Having said all that, **you may not need to create custom images**. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re specific needs are here, so I would encourage you to take a look at [this SO post, which has some possible ways to customize the container images generated by Spring Boot](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69447497/is-it-possible-to-customize-docker-image-generated-with-spring-native-with-buil/69466535#69466535).\r\n\r\n    I would also suggest that you try to take a step back and rethink the problem you have to solve. It is often the case that converting a Dockerfile to Buildpacks can be more complicated and produce awkward results because you&#39;re trying to reimplement your Dockerfile solution to the problem. If you instead think about how you could solve the actual problem using Buildpacks, you might come out with a more elegant solution.\r\n\r\n    ","title":"Buildpacks + SpringBoot: Port and configuration issues for Docker image","body":"<p>Trying to pick out and answer your questions, if I missed anything let me know.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>You shouldn't generally need to set an entry point.

But, I don't know if this is possible.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen examples with suggestions to define an explicit \"type\" field in each specific schema, with more of an association than inheritance semantics.</p>\n\n<p>I use my base class heavily in my factory classes and other parts of the code with generics like <code>&lt;T extends BaseObject&gt;</code>. Currently, I had it code generated from the JSON Schema, which supports inheritance.</p>\n\n<p>Another side question: can you use IDL to define just records without the protocol definition? I think the answer is no because the compiler complains about the missing protocol keyword.</p>\n\n<p>Help appreciated!

Now, you don't need to use the magic  function <code>mockConstruction</code> anymore.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":5847688,"reputation":11485,"user_id":4607349,"accept_rate":74,"display_name":"Michal Foksa"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":10,"is_accepted":false,"score":10,"last_activity_date":1672602798,"creation_date":1672602798,"answer_id":74977032,"question_id":71963893,"body_markdown":"    // Map of created Bar(s) and its constructor arguments\r\n    // If single object is expected to be created then simple list of objects is enough\r\n    final Map&lt;Bar, List&lt;Object&gt;&gt; constructorArgs = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n    try (MockedConstruction&lt;Bar&gt; mockedBarClass = Mockito.mockConstruction(Bar.class,\r\n            (mock, context) -&gt; constructorArgs.put(mock, new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(context.arguments())))) {\r\n\r\n        // WHEN\r\n        new Foo(1);\r\n\r\n        // THEN\r\n        assertThat(mockedBarClass.constructed()).hasSize(1);\r\n        // Get created object\r\n        Bar createdBar = mockedBarClass.constructed().get(0);\r\n        // Assert constructor arguments\r\n        assertThat(constructorArgs.get(createdBar)).hasSize(1);\r\n        assertThat(constructorArgs.get(createdBar).get(0)).isInstanceOf(Listener.class);\r\n    }","title":"Mockito Capture argument of a Constructor in mockConstruction","body":"<pre><code>// Map of created Bar(s) and its constructor arguments\n// If single object is expected to be created then simple list of objects is enough\nfinal Map&lt;Bar, List&lt;Object&gt;&gt; constructorArgs = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\ntry (MockedConstruction&lt;Bar&gt; mockedBarClass = Mockito.mockConstruction(Bar.class,\n        (mock, context) -&gt; constructorArgs.put(mock, new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(context.arguments())))) {\n\n    // WHEN\n    new Foo(1);\n\n    // THEN\n    assertThat(mockedBarClass.constructed()).hasSize(1);\n    // Get created object\n    Bar createdBar = mockedBarClass.constructed().get(0);\n    // Assert constructor arguments\n    assertThat(constructorArgs.get(createdBar)).hasSize(1);\n    assertThat(constructorArgs.get(createdBar).get(0)).isInstanceOf(Listener.class);\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1600176,"reputation":870,"user_id":1481358,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"ChaoSXDemon"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":2488,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"accepted_answer_id":71964813,"answer_count":2,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1672602798,"creation_date":1650605968,"question_id":71963893,"body_markdown":"I have the following classes:\r\n```\r\npublic class Bar {\r\n  \r\n  private final Listener mListener;\r\n  \r\n  public Bar(Listener listener) {\r\n    mListener = listener;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Foo {\r\n  \r\n  private final int mIntField;\r\n  private final Bar mBarObject;\r\n\r\n  public Foo(int intField) {\r\n    mIntField = intField;\r\n    mBarObject = new Bar(new Listener() { ... });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, I am writing test for `Foo` class and since `Bar` is not injected, I am using `mockConstruction` to force all instance of `Bar` being created after `mockConstruction` call to be mocked.

A custom callback is rarely necessary as a solution - Firestore *already* uses a callback. Instead, you just need to understand how a callback works and use it appropriately.\r\n\r\nFor example, you could solve your problem by splitting up your work into a few functions:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nbtnSignUp.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onClick(View view) {\r\n        String email = userEmail.getText().toString();\r\n        String password = userPassword.getText().toString();\r\n        createAccount(email, password);\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere the first function you call makes the first async request\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate void createAccount(String email, String password) {\r\n    Map&lt;String, Object&gt; data = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n    data.put(&quot;email&quot;, email);\r\n    data.put(&quot;password&quot;, password);\r\n\r\n    FirebaseFirestore db = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance();\r\n    db.collection(COLLECTION_USER).document(email)\r\n            .get()\r\n            .addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener&lt;DocumentSnapshot&gt;() {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public void onComplete(@NonNull Task&lt;DocumentSnapshot&gt; task) {\r\n                    // The &quot;createAccount&quot; function will exit before this is run,\r\n                    // so this MUST be called inside onComplete\r\n                    finishSignUp(task.getResult().exists());\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then calls the next function *inside* `onComplete` once the first call is done. You **cannot** call this until the data is retrieved, and that doesn&#39;t happen until your listener is called.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate void finishSignUp(boolean accountAvailable) {\r\n    //As no email document found,\r\n    //new data will insert to firebase firestore database\r\n    Log.d(TAG, &quot;Account available: &quot; + accountAvailable);\r\n\r\n    FirebaseFirestore db = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance();\r\n    if(!accountAvailable) {\r\n        db.collection(COLLECTION_USER).document(email).set(data).addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener&lt;Void&gt;() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void onComplete(@NonNull Task&lt;Void&gt; task) {\r\n                if(task.isSuccessful()) {\r\n                    Log.d(TAG, &quot;Data inserted as no account found&quot;);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    } else {\r\n        Log.d(TAG, &quot;Account available.

Instead, you just need to understand how a callback works and use it appropriately.</p>\n<p>For example, you could solve your problem by splitting up your work into a few functions:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>btnSignUp.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\n    @Override\n    public void onClick(View view) {\n        String email = userEmail.getText().toString();\n        String password = userPassword.getText().toString();\n        createAccount(email, password);\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where the first function you call makes the first async request</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>private void createAccount(String email, String password) {\n    Map&lt;String, Object&gt; data = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n    data.put(&quot;email&quot;, email);\n    data.put(&quot;password&quot;, password);\n\n    FirebaseFirestore db = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance();\n    db.collection(COLLECTION_USER).document(email)\n            .get()\n            .addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener&lt;DocumentSnapshot&gt;() {\n                @Override\n                public void onComplete(@NonNull Task&lt;DocumentSnapshot&gt; task) {\n                    // The &quot;createAccount&quot; function will exit before this is run,\n                    // so this MUST be called inside onComplete\n                    finishSignUp(task.getResult().exists());\n                }\n            });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>and then calls the next function <em>inside</em> <code>onComplete</code> once the first call is done. You <strong>cannot</strong> call this until the data is retrieved, and that doesn't happen until your listener is called.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>private void finishSignUp(boolean accountAvailable) {\n    //As no email document found,\n    //new data will insert to firebase firestore database\n    Log.d(TAG, &quot;Account available: &quot; + accountAvailable);\n\n    FirebaseFirestore db = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance();\n    if(!accountAvailable) {\n        db.collection(COLLECTION_USER).document(email).set(data).addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener&lt;Void&gt;() {\n            @Override\n            public void onComplete(@NonNull Task&lt;Void&gt; task) {\n                if(task.isSuccessful()) {\n                    Log.d(TAG, &quot;Data inserted as no account found&quot;);\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    } else {\n        Log.d(TAG, &quot;Account available. Can not sign up!&quot;);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":20231866,"reputation":61,"user_id":15541176,"display_name":"Arafat_19AK"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":81,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1672601596,"creation_date":1672588937,"question_id":74975679,"body_markdown":"I have a form that takes email and password.

I want the references in the execution time. All\r\n&gt; the refereces of a created object\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is no such feature available in Java. But, there is a way of being notified that there is no more reference to an object at runtime.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to create a weak reference to the monitored object and associate it with a [reference queue][1]. When there will be no more hard reference to that object, the GC will sooner or later recollect it and enqueue the weak reference. You can check this with [isEnqueued()][2].\r\n\r\nIf you provide more information about your issue, may be we can give more tips &amp; tricks.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nTo control all references to an oject, you may use the Proxy Pattern. Instead of setting references to your connection object, you create a proxy object containing a private instance of the connection object. Then, have your code call the proxy who will call the connection object itself, instead of having direct references to the connection.\r\n\r\nWhen you are done with the connection object, close it inside the proxy object. If other parts of the code still try to access that connection objects via the proxy, you will be able to detect it in the proxy when it is called.\r\n\r\nIt is a trick you can use to find which part of the code is still &#39;referencing&#39; your object, so to speak.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n \r\n  [1]: http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/ref/WeakReference.html#WeakReference%28T,%20java.lang.ref.ReferenceQueue%29\r\n  [2]: http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/ref/Reference.html#isEnqueued%28%29","title":"Is it possible see all the references to an object in execution time?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Sorry, was not clear. I want the references in the execution time. All\n  the refereces of a created object</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no such feature available in Java. But, there is a way of being notified that there is no more reference to an object at runtime.</p>\n\n<p>The solution is to create a weak reference to the monitored object and associate it with a <a href=\"http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/ref/WeakReference.html#WeakReference%28T,%20java.lang.ref.ReferenceQueue%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">reference queue</a>. When there will be no more hard reference to that object, the GC will sooner or later recollect it and enqueue the weak reference.

It needs two files as command line parameters and reads them. This program has worked great before and as it was a school project it went through many tests to make sure everything was working correctly. I downloaded the project from my submission to make sure I had the same version. Only thing this version lacked was the files to read because we were asked not to include them and rather use a path so they don&#39;t accidentally get tracked by version control. I added the files to the same directory as the main java file. When I run the program I get:\r\n\r\n    Welcome to &quot;Name of school project&quot;\r\n    Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException\r\n    \tat practice.collection.Collection.download(Collection.java:100)\r\n    \tat practice.UI.UI.mainLoop(UI.java:63)\r\n    \tat mainFile.main(mainFile.java:60)\r\n\r\nThis is what download method in Collection looks like:\r\n\r\n        public void download(String fileName) {\r\n            Scanner fileReader = null;\r\n            try {\r\n                File file = new File(fileName);\r\n                fileReader = new Scanner(file);\r\n                while (fileReader.hasNextLine()) {\r\n                   ***reads lines and does some sorting***\r\n                }\r\n                fileReader.close();\r\n            }\r\n            catch (FileNotFoundException | NumberFormatException e) {\r\n                fileReader.close(); ***this is line 100***\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Missing file!&quot;);\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Program terminated.&quot;);\r\n                System.exit(0);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nI have also made sure the files to be downloaded are the same as before, they are not empty and are being called with correct spelling, in correct order. Like this: java mainFile first_file.txt second_file.txt. Why is the program not finding the files like before? \r\n\r\nI did check out https://stackoverflow.com/questions/218384/what-is-a-nullpointerexception-and-how-do-i-fix-it but does not answer my question.

I think I should be able to fix this problem without touching the code. The program behaves the same way regardless of if the files have been included.","title":"NullPointerException when trying to read file, same exact code worked before","body":"<p>I wanted to run a Java program I wrote two years ago. It needs two files as command line parameters and reads them. This program has worked great before and as it was a school project it went through many tests to make sure everything was working correctly. I downloaded the project from my submission to make sure I had the same version. Only thing this version lacked was the files to read because we were asked not to include them and rather use a path so they don't accidentally get tracked by version control. I added the files to the same directory as the main java file. When I run the program I get:</p>\n<pre><code>Welcome to &quot;Name of school project&quot;\nException in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException\n    at practice.collection.Collection.download(Collection.java:100)\n    at practice.UI.UI.mainLoop(UI.java:63)\n    at mainFile.main(mainFile.java:60)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is what download method in Collection looks like:</p>\n<pre><code>    public void download(String fileName) {\n        Scanner fileReader = null;\n        try {\n            File file = new File(fileName);\n            fileReader = new Scanner(file);\n            while (fileReader.hasNextLine()) {\n               ***reads lines and does some sorting***\n            }\n            fileReader.close();\n        }\n        catch (FileNotFoundException | NumberFormatException e) {\n            fileReader.close(); ***this is line 100***\n            System.out.println(&quot;Missing file!&quot;);\n            System.out.println(&quot;Program terminated.&quot;);\n            System.exit(0);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>I have also made sure the files to be downloaded are the same as before, they are not empty and are being called with correct spelling, in correct order. Like this: java mainFile first_file.txt second_file.txt. Why is the program not finding the files like before?</p>\n<p>I did check out <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/218384/what-is-a-nullpointerexception-and-how-do-i-fix-it\">What is a NullPointerException, and how do I fix it?</a> but does not answer my question.

How can I make this multi-Threaded?</p>\n<p>Happy Holidays and Thank you.</p>\n<p>Peter Jerkewitz</p>\n<p>Sample Code:</p>\n<pre><code>ArrayList&lt;Path&gt; seeds = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();   // This is where we are going to start looking \n\n\nprivate void launchTreeWalkers() {\n  \n ArrayList&lt;Path&gt; effectivelyFinalPath = this.seeds;   // Physical drives on the computer ie  C:\\ D:\\ E:\\ ...   \n  int[] index = new int[1];       //  Effectively Final\n  this.twThreads = new Thread[ effectivelyFinalPath.size() ];  // TreeWalkerThreads \n  \n  for ( int i=0; i &lt; effectivelyFinalPath.size(); i++ ) {\n    index[i] = i; \n    \n    this.twThreads[i] = new Thread( new Runnable() { \n                             @Override\n                             public void run() {\n                               try {\n                                tTreeWalker2( effectivelyFinalPath.get( index[0]) );\n                              } catch ( Exception ex ) {\n                                ex.printStackTrace();\n                              }\n                             }\n                           }\n                         );\n    \n    this.twThreads[i].setDaemon( true );  // So the thread will die when the parent dies.\n    this.twThreads[i].setName(&quot;Tree Walker&quot;);\n    this.twThreads[i].start();\n  }  \n  \n  Display.fmt(&quot;%1$,d Tree Walker thread%2$s %3$s been started.&quot;, box( this.twThreads.length ), Aide.plural(this.twThreads.length), Aide.hasHave( this.twThreads.length ) ); \n}\n\n/** A walkFileTree thread   */\nvoid tTreeWalker( Path startingPath ) throws Exception {\n    \n  @SuppressWarnings(&quot;resource&quot;)  // java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException when closing FileSystem  \n  FileSystem fileSystem = FileSystems.getDefault();   \n\n  Files.walkFileTree( fileSystem.getPath( startingPath.toString() ), new FileVisitorImpl()); \n}\n\n\n/** */\npublic class FileVisitorImpl implements FileVisitor&lt;Path&gt; {\n  \n  @Override   // Called before a directory visit.\n  public FileVisitResult preVisitDirectory( Path directory, BasicFileAttributes attrs ) throws IOException {\n    Locate.this.folderCountLA.increment();  // Long Adder\n\n    if ( isMatch( excludeFolders, directory ))\n      return FileVisitResult.SKIP_SUBTREE;\n\n    Locate.this.foldersSelectedLA.increment(); \n    return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE;\n  }\n\n  @Override   // Called after a directory visit is complete.\n  public FileVisitResult postVisitDirectory( Path dir, IOException exc ) throws IOException {\n    return FileVisitResult.CONTINUE;\n  }\n\n  @Override    // This method is called for each file visited.

If your string is not in this format, you can build a custom <code>DateTimeFormatter</code>.</p>\n<p>An alternative to parsing to <code>MonthDay</code> is building a <code>DateTimeFormatter</code> with default year which will allow your string to be parsed directly into a <code>LocalDate</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Demo</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code>class Main {\n    public static void main(String args[]) {\n        // If your string is in --MM-dd format\n        MonthDay monthDay = MonthDay.parse(&quot;--03-10&quot;);\n        // If you want the current year, replace 1 with Year.now().getValue()\n        LocalDate date = monthDay.atYear(1);\n        System.out.println(date);\n\n        // If your string is in MM-dd format\n        DateTimeFormatter monthDayFormatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(&quot;MM-dd&quot;, Locale.ENGLISH);\n        monthDay = MonthDay.parse(&quot;03-10&quot;, monthDayFormatter);\n        // If you want the current year, replace 1 with Year.now().getValue()\n        date = monthDay.atYear(1);\n        System.out.println(date);\n\n        // An alternative solution\n        DateTimeFormatter dtf = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder()\n                .appendPattern(&quot;MM-dd&quot;)\n                // If you want the current year, replace 1 with Year.now().getValue()\n                .parseDefaulting(ChronoField.YEAR, 1)\n                .toFormatter(Locale.ENGLISH);\n        date = LocalDate.parse(&quot;03-10&quot;, dtf);\n        System.out.println(date);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Output</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code>0001-03-10\n0001-03-10\n0001-03-10\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://ideone.com/uypqUk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><kbd>ONLINE DEMO</kbd></a></p>\n<p>Learn more about the modern Date-Time API from <strong><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Trail: Date Time</a></strong>.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":3360223,"reputation":2475,"user_id":2822178,"accept_rate":54,"display_name":"User3"},"comment_count":14,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1044,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1672581656,"creation_date":1406883036,"question_id":25076329,"body_markdown":"I am using the following lines of code to parse a `String` as a `Date`: \r\n\r\n    String displayBirthday;\r\n    ...\r\n    java.util.Date  ss1=new Date(displayBirthday);\r\n\tSimpleDateFormat formatter5=new SimpleDateFormat(&quot;yyyy-MM-dd&quot;);\r\n\tdisplayBirthday = formatter5.format(ss1);\r\n\tli.add(displayBirthday);\r\n\r\nIt works fine for many dates, but when I want to parse a date like: 0001-03-10\r\n\r\nIt gives me the following error: \r\n\r\n    java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Parse error: 0001-03-10\r\n\r\nI am using a prefix of 0001 for dates which dont have a year as an internal representation.
