We always will, also when several time zones are mixed.</p>\n<p><strong>Documentation link:</strong> <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#max(java.util.Collection)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Collections.max()</code></a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":11027701,"reputation":29,"user_id":8100039,"display_name":"Ali Alvi"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":106,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1672568354,"creation_date":1613163312,"question_id":66178889,"body_markdown":"I have a list of `DateTime` objects and my task is to compare them and find the latest timestamp.

I know this is a assignment and got some of the code references from this site also, but i study them as i took some references, not just copy and paste.</p>\n<p>This is where i get stuck</p>\n<pre><code>if (choice == 'c') {\n            input.nextLine();\n            String seatchoice = input.nextLine();\n            char[][] seats = new char [13][6]; \n            for(i = 0; i &lt; 13; i++) {\n                seats[i][0] = '*';\n                seats[i][1] = '*';\n                seats[i][2] = '*';\n                seats[i][3] = '*';\n                seats[i][4] = '*';\n                seats[i][5] = '*'; \n            }\n            while (seatchoice.length() &gt; 0 ) {\n                int row = seatchoice.charAt(0) - '1';\n                int col = seatchoice.charAt(1) - 'A';\n                if (seats[row][col] != 'x') {\n                    seats[row][col] = 'x';\n                    System.out.println(&quot; &quot;);\n                    printSeats(seats);\n                }\n        }\n       }\n</code></pre>\n<p>the method printSeats</p>\n<pre><code>private static void printSeats(char[][] seats) {\n         System.out.println(&quot;\\t A B C D E F&quot;);\n         for (int i = 0; i &lt; seats.length; i++) {\n             System.out.println(&quot;Row &quot; + (1 + i) + &quot;\\t &quot; + seats[i][0] + &quot; &quot; + seats[i][1] + &quot; &quot; + seats[i][2] + &quot; &quot; \n         + seats[i][3] + &quot; &quot; + seats[i][4] + &quot; &quot; + seats[i][5]);\n         }\n          \n     }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, when i try inputting &quot;10A&quot; it will give me, Index -17 out of bounds for length 6.

Reason I ask is that because once you have the dependency above, you don&#39;t need to have explicitly include `@EnableResourceServer`.\r\n\r\n* All then you have to do is add the property, something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.jwk-set-uri=http://openam.localtest.me:8080/openam/oauth2/realms/subrealm/connect/jwk_uri\r\n```\r\n\r\n***NOTE: I also noticed you are missing the `spring.` prefix in the properties file ?***\r\n\r\nThose are the only two things that you have to do. No need to manually override the default provided by the Spring Boot&#39;s `startup` modules.\r\n\r\nWhat will happen then is that, once your Web / REST endpoint receives an HTTP `Authorization` header with a `Bearer` token ... ***AND*** ... the bearer token is a signed JWT, the resource server will then :\r\n - Query the URL specified by `spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.jwk-set-uri` property.\r\n - From the set of keys in that URL, the resource server will then find a public key with the same `kid` as the `kid` in the signed JWT bearer token.\r\n - Theoretically then, this URL could be anywhere, it does not have to be served up by an authorisation server.\r\n - Once found, the resource server then verifies the signature of the signed JWT bearer token, either returning an HTTP 401 back to the client if the signed JWT could not be verified, or an HTTP 200 if it is successful ( assuming you don&#39;t have other enforcements in place ).\r\n\r\n____________________________________\r\nI am sort of in the same journey, where I have to make the public key visible somehow listed into that URL defined in the resource server&#39;s `application.properties` file, pointing to ForgeRock AM&#39;s `connect/jwk_uri` ... but the public key I added into **JWK Set** of ForgeRock AM&#39;s trusted JWT issuer does not appear in the `connect/jwk_uri` URL when queried from a browser / curl.\r\n\r\nIt seems like that Spring Security&#39;s Resource Server support for JWT bearer token authorisation, as highlighted in the Spring Security documentation URL at:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/5.7/servlet/oauth2/resource-server/jwt.html\r\n\r\n... is not compatible with what ForgeRock AM expects.\r\n\r\ne.g.:\r\n\r\nSpringBoot OAuth2 Resource Server JWT token support\r\n====================\r\n \r\nSpringBoot OAuth2 Resource Server expects the following when receiving signed JWT as bearer in the `Authorization` HTTP header :\r\n\r\n - Client creates and signs a JWT, and send the signed JWT as bearer token in the `Authorization` HTTP header request to the Resource Server with a grant type of `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`.\r\n - Spring&#39;s OAuth2 Resource Server sees that the bearer token is a signed JWT, so looks up a matching public key from the `spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.jwk-set-uri` property. ( You can also try first loading them locally from `spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.public-key-location` - this one expected to be in PEM format. )\r\n - Spring&#39;s OAuth2 Resource Server verifies the signed JWT bearer token using a matching public key found from the previous step.\r\n - Spring&#39;s OAuth2 Resource Server then allows the HTTP request through. Otherwise, returns an HTTP 401.\r\n\r\nForgeRock AM&#39;s expected flow with JWT profile for OAuth 2.0 authorization grant\r\n===================\r\n\r\nWhereas ForgeRock AM&#39;s model expects a different flow ( documented here : https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/am/7.2/oauth2-guide/oauth2-jwt-bearer-grant.html )\r\n\r\n - It is expected that the resource server will be setup for opaque bearer token, not JWT bearer token, as defined here :\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/5.7/servlet/oauth2/resource-server/opaque-token.html\r\n\r\nSo you change the following in your resource server&#39;s `application.properties`, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.opaque-token.introspection-uri=http://openam.localtest.me:8080/openam/oauth2/realms/subrealm/introspect\r\nspring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.opaque-token.client-id=someclient\r\nspring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.opaque-token.client-secret=somesecret\r\n```\r\n... and then remove / comment out the other properties related to jwk / jwt. ( e.g. Comment out `spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.jwk-set-uri` )\r\n\r\n - Client creates and signs a JWT, and send the signed JWT as bearer token in the `Authorization` HTTP header request to the ForgeRock Authorization Server with a grant type of `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`. It is therefore expected that ForgeRock AM&#39;s trusted JWT issuer agent has been configured with the public key JWKS of the signer in the previous step.\r\n - AM server then validates the signed JWT and generates and returns an access token ( an opaque token in Spring&#39;s vocabulary ) back to the client.\r\n - Client then sends and uses this opaque access token as bearer token in the `Authorization` HTTP header request to the Resource Server ( e.g. Spring&#39;s OAuth2 resource server ).\r\n - Because it is an opaque token, Spring&#39;2 OAuth2 resource server then calls the introspection URI ( `spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.opaque-token.introspection-uri` ), which is an endpoint exposed by the AM server to validate the access token. \r\n - Based on the result of the call, resource server than either rejects ( with an HTTP 401 ) or accepts the HTTP call from the client.\r\n\r\nBecause of this ( not being able to include the public key that I added into the HTTP output of ForgeRock AM&#39;s `connect/jwk_uri`, I am now looking to follow that grant flow documented by ForgeRock AM.\r\n\r\n____________________________________\r\nAlso, the documentation at :\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/5.7/servlet/oauth2/resource-server/jwt.html\r\n\r\n.. says that you need to explicitly include both `spring-security-oauth2-resource-server` and `spring-security-oauth2-jose` to support signed JWT.

i &lt; pixels.length; i++) {\r\n    pixels[i] = 0xFF000000 | pixels[i];\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIs there a more efficient to do this (as the pixels array is updated many times every second)?\r\n\r\nI was hoping there&#39;s a IntRgbInstance but unfortunately there isn&#39;t (only ByteRgbInstance)\r\n\r\nOther approaches i&#39;ve tested:\r\n\r\nApproach 1: Creating a IntBuffer that is filled up like this: \r\n\r\n```java\r\nIntBuffer buffer = IntBuffer.allocate(pixels.length * 4);\r\nfor (int pixel : pixels) {\r\n    buffer.put(0xFF000000 | pixel);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd then generating a PixelBuffer that uses this buffer, the pixel buffer is then used as an input to this WritableImage constructor: https://openjfx.io/javadoc/17/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/image/WritableImage.html#%3Cinit%3E(javafx.scene.image.PixelBuffer)\r\nand then i display that WritableImage using a ImageView\r\n\r\nThis however still didn&#39;t speed up anything(rather made it a bit slower) and im guessing that because i have to construct a new WritableImage instance each time the pixels int array is updated.\r\n\r\nApproach 2 (that didn&#39;t work for some reason, i.e. it displayed nothing in the screen): Creating a buffer the same way as above and using that in one of the setPixels() methods that takes in a buffer:\r\n```java\r\nIntBuffer buffer = IntBuffer.allocate(pixels.length * 4);\r\nfor (int pixel : pixels) {\r\n    buffer.put(0xFF000000 | pixel);\r\n}\r\npw.setPixels(0, 0, width, height, PixelFormat.getIntArgbInstance(), buffer, width);\r\n```\r\nAfter a bit of more research i found out that i don&#39;t need to create a new WritableImage instance each time the pixels array is updated but i can just use the updateBuffer method here: https://openjfx.io/javadoc/17/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/image/PixelBuffer.html#updateBuffer(javafx.util.Callback)\r\n\r\nSo the code currently looks like this:\r\n```java\r\npb.updateBuffer(callback -&gt;

i &lt; pixels.length; i++) {\n    pixels[i] = 0xFF000000 | pixels[i];\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is there a more efficient to do this (as the pixels array is updated many times every second)?</p>\n<p>I was hoping there's a IntRgbInstance but unfortunately there isn't (only ByteRgbInstance)</p>\n<p>Other approaches i've tested:</p>\n<p>Approach 1: Creating a IntBuffer that is filled up like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>IntBuffer buffer = IntBuffer.allocate(pixels.length * 4);\nfor (int pixel : pixels) {\n    buffer.put(0xFF000000 | pixel);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then generating a PixelBuffer that uses this buffer, the pixel buffer is then used as an input to this WritableImage constructor: <a href=\"https://openjfx.io/javadoc/17/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/image/WritableImage.html#%3Cinit%3E(javafx.scene.image.PixelBuffer)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://openjfx.io/javadoc/17/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/image/WritableImage.html#%3Cinit%3E(javafx.scene.image.PixelBuffer)</a>\nand then i display that WritableImage using a ImageView</p>\n<p>This however still didn't speed up anything(rather made it a bit slower) and im guessing that because i have to construct a new WritableImage instance each time the pixels int array is updated.</p>\n<p>Approach 2 (that didn't work for some reason, i.e. it displayed nothing in the screen): Creating a buffer the same way as above and using that in one of the setPixels() methods that takes in a buffer:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>IntBuffer buffer = IntBuffer.allocate(pixels.length * 4);\nfor (int pixel : pixels) {\n    buffer.put(0xFF000000 | pixel);\n}\npw.setPixels(0, 0, width, height, PixelFormat.getIntArgbInstance(), buffer, width);\n</code></pre>\n<p>After a bit of more research i found out that i don't need to create a new WritableImage instance each time the pixels array is updated but i can just use the updateBuffer method here: <a href=\"https://openjfx.io/javadoc/17/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/image/PixelBuffer.html#updateBuffer(javafx.util.Callback)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://openjfx.io/javadoc/17/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/image/PixelBuffer.html#updateBuffer(javafx.util.Callback)</a></p>\n<p>So the code currently looks like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>pb.updateBuffer(callback -&gt; {\n    buffer.clear();\n    for (int pixel : pixels) {\n        buffer.put(0xFF000000 | pixel);\n    }\n    return null;\n});\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where pb, buffer is only created once like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>IntBuffer buffer = IntBuffer.allocate(pixels.length * 4);\nPixelBuffer&lt;IntBuffer&gt; pb = new PixelBuffer&lt;&gt;(width, height, buffer, PixelFormat.getIntArgbPreInstance());\nview.setImage(new WritableImage(pb));\n</code></pre>\n<p>and this did indeed result in a nice speedup (close to 2x compared to my initial approach)</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","data-structures"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":19055,"reputation":77531,"user_id":44309,"display_name":"High Performance Mark"},"score":1,"creation_date":1384953438,"post_id":20097009,"comment_id":29942683,"body_markdown":"Perhaps an image pyramid ?","body":"Perhaps an image pyramid ?"},{"owner":{"account_id":2653161,"reputation":1138,"user_id":2294365,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"aDoubleSo"},"score":0,"creation_date":1384953487,"post_id":20097009,"comment_id":29942707,"body_markdown":"Where do you get the data from.

All new model objects are created (Spring will automajically fill out your Form Backing object's attributes) and then that new object is passed into your <code>@PostMapping</code> method.</p>\n<h3>Side Notes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Generally speaking I normally recommend that folk's Domain Model Objects (things like your Comment class) and not used as your View Model Objects.</li>\n<li>Most likely, the User adding the comment should already be logged in and they shouldn't need to add their username to the form.</li>\n<li>Services tend to be used to change state of an application, not as a persistence layer to get objects from the database.  I would consider using a Data Access Object or a Repository.  (Use the Repository pattern...)</li>\n<li>When calling your Service you would call it with an object that represents all the state/attributes needed for creating a Comment and then the Service would create a new Transaction, create the Comment, set all appropriate state/values on the new Comment, call your persistence layer with the new Comment, and then close the Transaction.</li>\n</ul>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":23197145,"reputation":89,"user_id":17292614,"display_name":"Davido"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":202,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1672520890,"creation_date":1672495338,"question_id":74970024,"body_markdown":"I am trying to create a form, the object to be submitted will be a comment to a picture.
