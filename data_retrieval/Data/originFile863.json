What if `null` was passed to your method? Your code will fall with exception. It seems to me it makes sense to return `null` in this case.\r\n2. What if the argument string is empty, another words, its length is zero? This case must be considered separately.\r\n3. The `String` class in Java are immutable. Therefore, each concatenation of the strings creates a new instance of the `String` object. To build the result in this such case, it is better to use a `StringBuilder`.\r\n4. In your approach, you look forward when running along the string. You compare the current symbol with the following. To do this, you need carefully watch for index not exceeds the length of the string.  I propose to simplify this and not look forward at all.\r\n5. This is not pretty and you probably have a way to do it better. But after the end of the cycle, we need to add a last symbol in the string. This is a repeating piece of code, so I put it into a separate function.\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate static String getCompressedString(String str) {\r\n    if (Objects.isNull(str)) return null;\r\n    if (str.isEmpty()) return &quot;&quot;;\r\n\r\n    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();\r\n    char calculated = str.charAt(0);\r\n    int repeats = 0;\r\n\r\n    for (char observed : str.toCharArray()) {\r\n        if (observed == calculated) {\r\n            repeats++;\r\n        } else {\r\n            append(result, calculated, repeats);\r\n            calculated = observed;\r\n            repeats = 1;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    append(result, calculated, repeats);\r\n\r\n    return result.toString();\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate static void append(StringBuilder result, char calculated, int repeats) {\r\n    result.append(calculated);\r\n    if (repeats &gt; 1) {\r\n        result.append(repeats);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am completely sure that there is a way to make this code better and shorter.

The problem is that my class I want to serialize in is very complex and constructed from other classes.

Is there any way I can do this? Example to understand what I&#39;m talking about, so let&#39;s say I have this structure:\r\n```\r\npublic TestClass{\r\npublic Class1 first;\r\npublic Class2 second;\r\n...\r\npublic Class10 ten;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd all of the classes contain the data, something like this:\r\n```\r\npublic Class1{\r\npublic String name;\r\npublic int id;\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nObviously I don&#39;t want to manually map all of that, but all of the examples in the internet show exactly that, is there any way to read the values into classes directly without needing doing manual mapping?

There is an unused sorting algorithm present as its own method named selectionSort. This is actually from a textbook.</p>\n<p>I need to use that method to sort the array and create an additional output like the second example shown below where the test scores are displayed in ascending order. The only hint I have is that I need to make another array of the indices of the first array.</p>\n<p>I'm not supposed to put any additional code in the main method, so I assume I will need a separate method? Or can I put all of the additional code in the selectionSort method so I only have to call one method?
