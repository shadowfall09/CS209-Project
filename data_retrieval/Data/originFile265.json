There are two solutions:\r\n\r\n* Implicitly: in your mapping, you can specify not only an [analyzer](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-analyzer) (using `@FullTextField(analyzer = &quot;myAnalyzer&quot;)`), but also a [&quot;search&quot; analyzer](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-search-analyzer) using `@FullTextField(analyzer = &quot;myAnalyzer&quot;, searchAnalyzer = &quot;mySearchAnalyzer&quot;)`. The &quot;default&quot; analyzer will be used when indexing, while the &quot;search&quot; analyzer will be used when searching (querying).\r\n* Explicitly: at query time, you can override the analyzer on a given predicate by calling `.analyzer(&quot;mySearchAnalyzer&quot;)` while building the predicate. There is one example [in this section of the documentation](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-analyzer).\r\n\r\nNote however that dynamic fields are not supported yet in Hibernate Search 6: [HSEARCH-3273](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3273).","title":"Hibernate search: Indexed data with Ngram filter and while searching it gives incorrect result due to tokenizing while querying","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>Above Lucene query is prepared using BooleanJunction::must conditions by Lucene I guess which means it should match all the conditions.

There are two solutions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implicitly: in your mapping, you can specify not only an <a href=\"https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-analyzer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">analyzer</a> (using <code>@FullTextField(analyzer = &quot;myAnalyzer&quot;)</code>), but also a <a href=\"https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-search-analyzer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">&quot;search&quot; analyzer</a> using <code>@FullTextField(analyzer = &quot;myAnalyzer&quot;, searchAnalyzer = &quot;mySearchAnalyzer&quot;)</code>. The &quot;default&quot; analyzer will be used when indexing, while the &quot;search&quot; analyzer will be used when searching (querying).</li>\n<li>Explicitly: at query time, you can override the analyzer on a given predicate by calling <code>.analyzer(&quot;mySearchAnalyzer&quot;)</code> while building the predicate. There is one example <a href=\"https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#mapper-orm-directfieldmapping-analyzer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in this section of the documentation</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note however that dynamic fields are not supported yet in Hibernate Search 6: <a href=\"https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HSEARCH-3273\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HSEARCH-3273</a>.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":7347238,"reputation":41,"user_id":5594540,"display_name":"Satheesh Kannan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":619,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1691390042,"creation_date":1581692223,"question_id":60228692,"body_markdown":"I have an analyzer with this configuration,\r\n```\r\nsearchMapping//\r\n        .analyzerDef(BaseEntity.CUSTOM_SEARCH_INDEX_ANALYZER, WhitespaceTokenizerFactory.class)//\r\n        .filter(LowerCaseFilterFactory.class)//\r\n        .filter(ASCIIFoldingFilterFactory.class)//\r\n        .filter(NGramFilterFactory.class).param(&quot;minGramSize&quot;, &quot;1&quot;).param(&quot;maxGramSize&quot;, &quot;200&quot;);\r\n```\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\nThis is how my entity field is configured\r\n```\r\n@Field(analyzer = @Analyzer(definition = CUSTOM_SEARCH_INDEX_ANALYZER))\r\nprivate String bookName;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is how I create a search query\r\n```\r\nqueryBuilder.keyword().onField(prefixedPath).matching(matchingString).createQuery()\r\n```\r\nI have an entity with value bookName=&quot;Gulliver&quot; and another entity with bookName=&quot;xGulliver&quot;;\r\n\r\nIf I tried to search with data `bookName = xG` then am getting both entities where I would expect entity only with `bookName=&quot;xGulliver&quot;`;\r\nAlso looked on the query that is produced by hibernate-search.\r\n&gt; Executing Lucene query &#39;+(+(+(+(\r\n\t\tbookName:x \r\n\t\tbookName:xg \r\n\t\tbookName:g))))\r\n\t\t\r\nAbove Lucene query is prepared using `BooleanJunction::must` conditions by Lucene I guess which means it should match all the conditions.\r\nStill why its giving me both entity data.

Log4J? etc)\r\n\r\nSecond, &quot;Coloring&quot; is not something meaningful in most case.

The Java Virtual Machine is a\r\n&gt; program, for a particular hardware and software platform, that runs\r\n&gt; Java technology applications. An API is a collection of software\r\n&gt; components that you can use to create other software components or\r\n&gt; applications. Each Java platform provides a virtual machine and an\r\n&gt; API, and this allows applications written for that platform to run on\r\n&gt; any compatible system with all the advantages of the Java programming\r\n&gt; language: platform-independence, power, stability,\r\n&gt; ease-of-development, and security. \r\n&gt; \r\n\r\nJava SE\r\n-------\r\n\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; When most people think of the Java programming language, they think of\r\n&gt; the Java SE API. Java SE&#39;s API provides the core functionality of the\r\n&gt; Java programming language. It defines everything from the basic types\r\n&gt; and objects of the Java programming language to high-level classes\r\n&gt; that are used for networking, security, database access, graphical\r\n&gt; user interface (GUI) development, and XML parsing.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; In addition to the core API, the Java SE platform consists of a\r\n&gt; virtual machine, development tools, deployment technologies, and other\r\n&gt; class libraries and toolkits commonly used in Java technology\r\n&gt; applications. \r\n&gt; \r\n\r\nJava EE\r\n-------\r\n\r\n&gt;  \r\n&gt; The Java EE platform is built on top of the Java SE platform. The Java\r\n&gt; EE platform provides an API and runtime environment for developing and\r\n&gt; running large-scale, multi-tiered, scalable, reliable, and secure\r\n&gt; network applications. \r\n&gt; \r\n\r\nJava ME\r\n-------\r\n\r\n&gt;  \r\n&gt; The Java ME platform provides an API and a small-footprint virtual\r\n&gt; machine for running Java programming language applications on small\r\n&gt; devices, like mobile phones. The API is a subset of the Java SE API,\r\n&gt; along with special class libraries useful for small device application\r\n&gt; development. Java ME applications are often clients of Java EE\r\n&gt; platform services. \r\n&gt; \r\n\r\nJavaFX\r\n------\r\n\r\n&gt;  \r\n&gt; JavaFX is a platform for creating rich internet applications using a\r\n&gt; lightweight user-interface API. JavaFX applications use\r\n&gt; hardware-accelerated graphics and media engines to take advantage of\r\n&gt; higher-performance clients and a modern look-and-feel as well as\r\n&gt; high-level APIs for connecting to networked data sources.

It defines everything from the basic types\n  and objects of the Java programming language to high-level classes\n  that are used for networking, security, database access, graphical\n  user interface (GUI) development, and XML parsing.</p>\n  \n  <p>In addition to the core API, the Java SE platform consists of a\n  virtual machine, development tools, deployment technologies, and other\n  class libraries and toolkits commonly used in Java technology\n  applications. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Java EE</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Java EE platform is built on top of the Java SE platform. The Java\n  EE platform provides an API and runtime environment for developing and\n  running large-scale, multi-tiered, scalable, reliable, and secure\n  network applications. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Java ME</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Java ME platform provides an API and a small-footprint virtual\n  machine for running Java programming language applications on small\n  devices, like mobile phones. The API is a subset of the Java SE API,\n  along with special class libraries useful for small device application\n  development. Java ME applications are often clients of Java EE\n  platform services. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>JavaFX</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>JavaFX is a platform for creating rich internet applications using a\n  lightweight user-interface API. JavaFX applications use\n  hardware-accelerated graphics and media engines to take advantage of\n  higher-performance clients and a modern look-and-feel as well as\n  high-level APIs for connecting to networked data sources. JavaFX\n  applications may be clients of Java EE platform services.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2492059,"reputation":21,"user_id":2169322,"display_name":"romil"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1445081393,"creation_date":1445080469,"answer_id":33185974,"question_id":2857376,"body_markdown":"EE:- Enterprise Edition:- This Java edition is specifically designed for enterprise applications/business where we have to deal with number of different servers with importance on security, transaction management etc. \r\n\r\nSE:- Standard Edition:- This edition is for standard applications. \r\n\r\nME:- Micro Edition:- This java edition is specifically designed for mobile phone platforms.

All the `Writer` approaches below rely on this class, either explicitly or [under the hood][3].\r\n\r\n```java\r\ntry (FileOutputStream stream = new FileOutputStream(&quot;file.txt&quot;);) {\r\n    byte data[] = &quot;foo&quot;.getBytes();\r\n    stream.write(data);\r\n} catch (IOException e) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the [try-with-resources statement][4] takes care of `stream.close()` and that closing the stream flushes it, like `stream.flush()`.\r\n## [OutputStreamWriter][5]\r\n\r\nThis class is a bridge from character streams to byte streams. It can wrap a `FileOutputStream`, and write strings:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nCharset utf8 = StandardCharsets.UTF_8;\r\ntry (OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(&quot;file.txt&quot;)), utf8)) {\r\n    writer.write(&quot;foo&quot;);\r\n} catch (IOException e) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [BufferedWriter][6]\r\n\r\nThis class writes text to a character-output stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient writing of single characters, arrays, and strings.\r\n\r\nIt can wrap an `OutputStreamWriter`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ntry (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(&quot;file.txt&quot;))))) {\r\n    writer.write(&quot;foo&quot;);\r\n    writer.newLine();  // method provided by BufferedWriter\r\n} catch (IOException e) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPre Java 5 this was the best approach for large files (with a regular try/catch block).\r\n\r\n### [FileWriter][7]\r\n\r\nThis is a subclass of the `OutputStreamWriter`, and is a convenience class for writing character files:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nboolean append = false;\r\ntry(FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(&quot;file.txt&quot;, append) ){\r\n    writer.write(&quot;foo&quot;);\r\n    writer.append(&quot;bar&quot;);\r\n} catch (IOException e) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe key benefit is that it has an optional `append` constructor argument, which determines whether it appends to or overwrites the existing file.  Note that the append/overwrite behaviour is not controlled by the `write()` and `append()` methods, which behave in [nearly the same way][8].\r\n\r\nNote that:\r\n - There is no buffering, but to handle large files it can be wrapped in a `BufferedWriter`.\r\n - `FileWriter` uses the default encoding. It&#39;s often preferable to specify encoding explicitly\r\n\r\n### [PrintWriter][9]\r\n\r\nThis class prints formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream. Under the hood it is the same as the `BufferedWriter` approach above (`new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(...)))`). `PrintWriter` was introduced in Java 5 as a convenient way to call this idiom, and adds additional methods such as `printf()` and `println()`.\r\n\r\nMethods in this class don&#39;t throw I/O exceptions. You can check errors by calling `checkError()`. The destination of a PrintWriter instance can be a File, OutputStream or Writer.  Here is an example of writing to a file:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ntry (PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;UTF-8&quot;)) {\r\n    writer.print(&quot;foo&quot;);\r\n    writer.printf(&quot;bar %d $&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, 1);\r\n    writer.println(&quot;baz&quot;);\r\n} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\r\n} catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen writing to an `OutputStream` or `Writer` there is an optional `autoFlush` constructor parameter, which is false by default.  Unlike the `FileWriter`, it will overwrite any existing file.\r\n\r\n### Files.write()\r\n\r\nJava 7 introduced [`java.nio.file.Files`][10]. `Files.write()` lets you create and write to a file in a single call.\r\n\r\n[@icza&#39;s answer][10] shows how to use this method.

All the <code>Writer</code> approaches below rely on this class, either explicitly or <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/5759958/1450420\">under the hood</a>.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>try (FileOutputStream stream = new FileOutputStream(&quot;file.txt&quot;);) {\n    byte data[] = &quot;foo&quot;.getBytes();\n    stream.write(data);\n} catch (IOException e) {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">try-with-resources statement</a> takes care of <code>stream.close()</code> and that closing the stream flushes it, like <code>stream.flush()</code>.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/OutputStreamWriter.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OutputStreamWriter</a></h2>\n<p>This class is a bridge from character streams to byte streams. It can wrap a <code>FileOutputStream</code>, and write strings:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>Charset utf8 = StandardCharsets.UTF_8;\ntry (OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(&quot;file.txt&quot;)), utf8)) {\n    writer.write(&quot;foo&quot;);\n} catch (IOException e) {}\n</code></pre>\n<h3><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/BufferedWriter.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BufferedWriter</a></h3>\n<p>This class writes text to a character-output stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient writing of single characters, arrays, and strings.</p>\n<p>It can wrap an <code>OutputStreamWriter</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(new File(&quot;file.txt&quot;))))) {\n    writer.write(&quot;foo&quot;);\n    writer.newLine();  // method provided by BufferedWriter\n} catch (IOException e) {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Pre Java 5 this was the best approach for large files (with a regular try/catch block).</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/FileWriter.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">FileWriter</a></h3>\n<p>This is a subclass of the <code>OutputStreamWriter</code>, and is a convenience class for writing character files:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>boolean append = false;\ntry(FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(&quot;file.txt&quot;, append) ){\n    writer.write(&quot;foo&quot;);\n    writer.append(&quot;bar&quot;);\n} catch (IOException e) {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The key benefit is that it has an optional <code>append</code> constructor argument, which determines whether it appends to or overwrites the existing file.  Note that the append/overwrite behaviour is not controlled by the <code>write()</code> and <code>append()</code> methods, which behave in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/5949975/1450420\">nearly the same way</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no buffering, but to handle large files it can be wrapped in a <code>BufferedWriter</code>.</li>\n<li><code>FileWriter</code> uses the default encoding. It's often preferable to specify encoding explicitly</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PrintWriter</a></h3>\n<p>This class prints formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream. Under the hood it is the same as the <code>BufferedWriter</code> approach above (<code>new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(...)))</code>). <code>PrintWriter</code> was introduced in Java 5 as a convenient way to call this idiom, and adds additional methods such as <code>printf()</code> and <code>println()</code>.</p>\n<p>Methods in this class don't throw I/O exceptions. You can check errors by calling <code>checkError()</code>. The destination of a PrintWriter instance can be a File, OutputStream or Writer.  Here is an example of writing to a file:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>try (PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;UTF-8&quot;)) {\n    writer.print(&quot;foo&quot;);\n    writer.printf(&quot;bar %d $&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, 1);\n    writer.println(&quot;baz&quot;);\n} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n} catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When writing to an <code>OutputStream</code> or <code>Writer</code> there is an optional <code>autoFlush</code> constructor parameter, which is false by default.  Unlike the <code>FileWriter</code>, it will overwrite any existing file.</p>\n<h3>Files.write()</h3>\n<p>Java 7 introduced <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/23221771/1450420\"><code>java.nio.file.Files</code></a>. <code>Files.write()</code> lets you create and write to a file in a single call.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/23221771/1450420\">@icza's answer</a> shows how to use this method.

See the free-of-cost [tutorial by Oracle][2].\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s write a Java record to represent your pair of dates.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage work.basil.example.storage;\r\n\r\nimport java.time.LocalDate;\r\nimport java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit;\r\n\r\npublic record DatePair( LocalDate start ,\r\n                        LocalDate end ,\r\n                        long days )\r\n{\r\n    public DatePair\r\n    {\r\n        if ( days != ChronoUnit.DAYS.between ( start , end ) )\r\n        {\r\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException ( &quot;The days argument must be an accurate count of days elapsed between the two dates. Count must be Half-Open, where the beginning is *inclusive* while the ending is *exclusive*.&quot; );\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static DatePair of ( LocalDate start , LocalDate end )\r\n    {\r\n        return new DatePair ( start , end , ChronoUnit.DAYS.between ( start , end ) );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRecords were added to Java 16. For earlier Java, use a conventional class as seen at bottom of this Answer.\r\n\r\nWe can use `Files.write` and `Files.read` to easily write and read your pairs of data in a textual data file. The [`.write` method by default][3] will (a) create the file if it does not yet exist, and (b) remove all data from an existing file. \r\n\r\nHere is a demo app that starts with two pairs of dates, writes those, reads them back, adds a third pair, then does another write and read.\r\n\r\nThis code replaces all the data in the file every time it writes. You could append instead of replacing, but with so little data it hardly matters. \r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage work.basil.example.storage;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.IOException;\r\nimport java.nio.file.Files;\r\nimport java.nio.file.Path;\r\nimport java.nio.file.Paths;\r\nimport java.time.LocalDate;\r\nimport java.time.Month;\r\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\n\r\npublic class App\r\n{\r\n    public static void main ( String[] args )\r\n    {\r\n        App app = new App ( );\r\n        app.demo ( );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @SuppressWarnings ( &quot;branch identical&quot; )\r\n    private void demo ( )\r\n    {\r\n        // Input data.\r\n        List &lt; DatePair &gt; pairsOfDates_1 =\r\n                List.of (\r\n                        DatePair.of ( LocalDate.now ( ) , LocalDate.now ( ).plusDays ( 2 ) ) ,\r\n                        DatePair.of ( LocalDate.of ( 2024 , Month.JANUARY , 23 ) , LocalDate.of ( 2024 , Month.JANUARY , 27 ) )\r\n                );\r\n        System.out.println ( &quot;pairsOfDates_1 = &quot; + pairsOfDates_1 );\r\n\r\n        // Write.\r\n        Path path = Paths.get ( &quot;/Users/some_user/PairsOfDatesExample.txt&quot; );\r\n        this.writePairsOfDates ( pairsOfDates_1 , path );\r\n\r\n        // Read.\r\n        List &lt; DatePair &gt; pairsOfDates_2 = this.readPairsOfDates ( path );\r\n        System.out.println ( &quot;pairsOfDates_2 = &quot; + pairsOfDates_2 );\r\n\r\n        // Add data.\r\n        List &lt; DatePair &gt; pairsOfDates_3 = new ArrayList &lt;&gt; ( pairsOfDates_2 );\r\n        pairsOfDates_3.add (\r\n                DatePair.of (\r\n                        LocalDate.of ( 2030 , Month.FEBRUARY , 2 ) ,\r\n                        LocalDate.of ( 2030 , Month.MARCH , 1 )\r\n                )\r\n        );\r\n        System.out.println ( &quot;pairsOfDates_3 = &quot; + pairsOfDates_3 );\r\n\r\n        // Write data again, replacing existing data file.\r\n        this.writePairsOfDates ( pairsOfDates_3 , path );\r\n\r\n        // Read new file.\r\n        List &lt; DatePair &gt; pairsOfDates_4 = this.readPairsOfDates ( path );\r\n        System.out.println ( &quot;pairsOfDates_4 = &quot; + pairsOfDates_4 );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void writePairsOfDates ( List &lt; DatePair &gt; dates , Path path )\r\n    {\r\n        List &lt; String &gt; lines =\r\n                dates\r\n                        .stream ( )\r\n                        .map ( datePair -&gt; String.join ( &quot;/&quot; , datePair.start ( ).toString ( ) , datePair.end ( ).toString ( ) ) )\r\n                        .toList ( );\r\n        System.out.println ( &quot;lines = &quot; + lines );\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            Files.write ( path , lines );\r\n        }\r\n        catch ( IOException e )\r\n        {\r\n            throw new RuntimeException ( e );\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private List &lt; DatePair &gt; readPairsOfDates ( final Path path )\r\n    {\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            List &lt; String &gt; lines = Files.readAllLines ( path );\r\n            List &lt; DatePair &gt; datePairs =\r\n                    lines\r\n                            .stream ( )\r\n                            .map ( ( String line ) -&gt;\r\n                            {\r\n                                String[] parts = line.split ( &quot;/&quot; );\r\n                                return DatePair.of ( LocalDate.parse ( parts[ 0 ] ) , LocalDate.parse ( parts[ 1 ] ) );\r\n                            } )\r\n                            .toList ( );\r\n            return datePairs;\r\n        }\r\n        catch ( IOException e )\r\n        {\r\n            throw new RuntimeException ( e );\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `LocalDateRange`\r\n\r\nWe need not write our own class for the pair of dates.

Otherwise I see two options:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Using <code>wait</code> + <code>notify</code> like @niculare suggested</li>\n<li>Somehow make the first consumer that notices the queue empty to notify the producer in a lock-free way; this will be slower but degrade \"more\" gracefully</li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":471835,"reputation":81,"user_id":879877,"display_name":"Henry Wong"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":8,"is_accepted":false,"score":8,"last_activity_date":1373564632,"creation_date":1373564632,"answer_id":17600022,"question_id":15184943,"body_markdown":"I understand you could already have bunch of threads actively polling or taking the queue but I still feel not quite right about your flow/design.\r\n\r\nThe queue becomes empty doesn&#39;t mean the previously added tasks are finished, somes of the items could take ages to process, so it is not too useful to check for empty.\r\n\r\nSo what you should do is forget about the `BlockingQueue`, you can use it as any other collections.

It does not describe the _how_, and &#39;can it be efficient&#39; is fundamentally a _how_ kind of question.\r\n\r\nHowever, one might ask for a hypothetical case where this can be fundamentally faster than all possible ways to remove a thing from a data storage concept in any other way.\r\n\r\nAnd that certainly exists. We need to look no farther than `java.util.LinkedList` and `java.util.ArrayList`.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s imagine we have a list that contains every &#39;counting word&#39;:\r\n\r\n```\r\nList&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); // or LinkedList\r\nlist.add(&quot;zero&quot;);\r\nlist.add(&quot;one&quot;);\r\nlist.add(&quot;two&quot;);\r\n...\r\nlist.add(&quot;ninety nine&quot;);\r\n...\r\nlist.add(&quot;one thousand and one&quot;);\r\nlist.add(&quot;one thousand and two&quot;);\r\n...\r\nlist.add(&quot;nine hundred and ninety nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nand we want to do some removal on it.\r\n\r\n## Let&#39;s remove a single item: 1001\r\n\r\nWe hate 1001 for some reason and want to get rid of it. We call `list.remove(1001)`.\r\n\r\n### `linkedList.remove(1001)`\r\n\r\nA linkedlist consists if a list of simple nodes. Each node keeps track of 3 things:\r\n\r\n* A pointer to the previous node. The first node in the list doesn&#39;t have one (`null`).\r\n* A pointer to the next node. The last node in the list doesn&#39;t have one (`null`).\r\n* A pointer to the object that is stored at this position.\r\n\r\nA LinkedList is then simply a list that has a pointer to the first node, and the last node, and that&#39;s all you need.\r\n\r\nTo remove the 1001st element. linked list does this:\r\n\r\n* Use its pointer to the first node. Ask it for its next node.\r\n* Ask _that_ node for _its_ next node.\r\n* repeat that process for 1001 steps.\r\n* Now we have the right node.\r\n\r\nThat was a pricey operation! But now that we have the right node, it&#39;s trivial:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNode oneThousandAndTwo = this.next;\r\nNode oneThousand = this.prev;\r\noneThousandAndTwo.prev = oneThousand;\r\noneThousand.next = oneThousandAndTwo;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that various books and tutorials like to state that &#39;removal in a linked list is `O(1)`. __This is highly misleading, bordering on a lie!__ - because, sure, deleting itself is fast, but you need to get to the right node first. Only if that can be shortcut somehow, it&#39;s fast. LinkedLists in java can delete _the first_ element very quickly (you don&#39;t need to spend 1001 steps to find the first node!), but not some node in the middle.\r\n\r\n### `arrayList.remove(1001)`\r\n\r\nArrayLists have, as the name suggests, a single array as underlying storage mechanism. Hence, to &#39;find&#39; the right element to delete, the arraylist just has to do `backingArray[1001]`. That was easy.\r\n\r\nBut it is that easy because all elements are in the right order in that backing array. So, to remove something, you need to shift __everything__ &#39;above&#39; the thing you want to delete down by one:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (int i = indexToDelete + 1; i &lt; size; i++) {\r\n  backingArray[i - 1] = backingArray[i];\r\n}\r\nsize--;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s what arraylist has to do. A _very_ pricey operation indeed! That&#39;s 998999 steps or so.\r\n\r\n## Remove the string &quot;one thousand and one&quot;\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s try something a little different. Instead of removing the 1001st element, we want to remove whatever element has the text &quot;one thousand and one&quot;. Yeah, you and I know it&#39;s index 1001, but the computer doesn&#39;t have a natural language processing system baked into it and it has no idea. There&#39;s nothing for it but to __find__ the item in question and then delete it. Let&#39;s try it!\r\n\r\n## `linkedList.remove(&quot;one thousand and one&quot;)`\r\n\r\nWe could simply call `.remove(&quot;one thousand and one&quot;)` but the story is very similar to `.remove(1001)`, so let&#39;s do it slightly differently and say that our search is actually user-supplied and pluggable. We store a predicate in a variable to represent it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPredicate&lt;String&gt; verboten = w -&gt; w.equals(&quot;one thousand and one&quot;);\r\n\r\n/* first find the index to remove */ {\r\nvar it = list.iterator();\r\nint index = 0;\r\nwhile (it.hasNext()) {\r\n  if (verboten.test(it.next()) break;\r\n  index++;\r\n}\r\n\r\nlist.remove(index);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code is worse than it looks! It will take 1001 steps to find the string &quot;one thousand and one&quot;, and we already established that `.remove(index)` _also_ takes 1001 steps. We now need 2002 steps to do the job and that feels kinda daft. We could do it in &#39;just&#39; 1001 though, because when we find the string &quot;one thousand and one&quot; we&#39;re already at the right node, so we should just use it instead of iterating from the start to get to the 1001 node a second time. You can&#39;t get at the nodes yourself but that iterator does have it (as a `private` field).\r\n\r\n__Here is your answer #1: The iterator has a `remove()` method so that it can reuse its node__.\r\n\r\nThis is therefore only 1001 steps:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPredicate&lt;String&gt; verboten = w -&gt; w.equals(&quot;one thousand and one&quot;);\r\n\r\nvar it = list.iterator();\r\nwhile (it.hasNext()) {\r\n  if (verboten.test(it.next()) {\r\n    it.remove();\r\n    break;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nArrayList is kinda screwed - it&#39;s going to take 1 million steps no matter what (1001 to get to the right place, then whatever&#39;s left to shift everything &#39;above it&#39; down by one).\r\n\r\nSounds like a big win for LinkedList but it really isn&#39;t - both of them needed a number of steps in the same order of magnitude as its total size.\r\n\r\nTo highlight how efficiency can really get tricky, let&#39;s go for the most interesting case yet:\r\n\r\n## Delete everything that matches a predicate\r\n\r\nActually, it&#39;s not so much &quot;one thousand and one&quot; we despise. It&#39;s everything whose first 3 letters are equal to its last three. We hate &quot;two hundred and two&quot; just as much. We even hate &quot;one&quot; because it trivially starts with the same 3 letters as it ends with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPredicate&lt;String&gt; verboten = w -&gt; w.substring(0, 3).equals(w.substring(w.length() - 3));\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we want to delete every verboten count from our list. Let&#39;s try it without removeIf, and write them as efficiently as we possibly can!\r\n\r\n### Remove verboten strings from `linkedList`\r\n\r\nOur first intent might simply be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (String word : linkedList) {\r\n  if (verboten.test(word)) linkedList.remove(word);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut [A] this doesn&#39;t work (modifying the list while you are iterating it causes a `ConcurrentModificationException`), but more imporantly, [B] if it _did_ work it would take __in the ballpark of a trillion steps__. A million times a million. We need to loop one million times, and `.remove(someWord)` can take up to 1 million steps to remove a thing, as we saw before.\r\n\r\nHence, bad code. Let&#39;s do it right:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar it = linkedList.iterator();\r\nwhile (it.hasNext()) {\r\n  if (verboten.test(it.next()) it.remove();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimple and quite effective - this takes only on the order of a million steps. We go through the list of linked nodes only once. For some nodes (any node whose value matches our &#39;verboten&#39; test) we shuffle some pointers around to &#39;cut our node out&#39; from between its neighbours, thus deleting it. Fantastic!\r\n\r\n### Remove verboten strings from `arrayList`\r\n\r\nHey, let&#39;s use the same code, right:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar it = arrayList.iterator();\r\nwhile (it.hasNext()) {\r\n  if (verboten.test(it.next()) it.remove();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOh dear. This __also takes on the order of a trillion steps__. The problem is, where `it.remove()` on LinkedList is fast, on arraylists it is not - it has to shift all elements above it down. So, this loops 1 million entries and for a percentage of them, takes up to 1 million steps to downshift all things above it. We&#39;re back to `O(n^2)` behaviour. This really really will take on the order of __hours__ (maybe days!) for a computer to do, whereas looping a million times is milliseconds, maybe even nanoseconds. Faster than human brains can even comprehend.\r\n\r\nBut, there _is_ a way to do it very quickly. It&#39;s just a little more complicated. We have to realize that we just need to shift all elements down by &#39;X&#39;, where X is increment everytime we see a verboten value. Then at the end we truncate the list and voila, we&#39;re done:\r\n\r\n```\r\nint deleted = 0;\r\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; list.size(); i++) {\r\n  String v = list.get(i);\r\n  if (verboten.test(v)) deleted++;\r\n  else list.set(i - deleted, v);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// remove the last element &#39;deleted&#39; times.\r\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; deleted; i++) {\r\n  list.remove(list.size() - 1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code takes only 1 million steps (`arrayList.remove(lastIndex)` is an extremely fast operation, even if the list is very large. Specifically removing the last item from an arraylist is easy).\r\n\r\nSo, if this is our answer, this is the fastest way and we should use this code for our linkedlist too!\r\n\r\n## OH DEAR!\r\n\r\nBut that code is painfully slow on linkedlists - removing the last index is in fact horrible (takes &#39;list size&#39; steps), so that&#39;s _over_ a trillion operations. Ouch.\r\n\r\n## `removeIf` to the rescue!\r\n\r\nFortunately, this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlist.removeIf(verboten);\r\n```\r\n\r\nis fast for either case. Because now we ask the list: Hey, __you__ figure out how to do this quickly. ArrayList&#39;s implementation of `removeIf` uses our &#39;scan through and shift down everything that doesn&#39;t need to be removed, then truncate the list&#39; operation that is fast for arraylists but slow for linked lists.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, linked lists just loops through its chain of nodes once and cuts out anything that matches, which is fast for linked lists.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why you want all 3.\r\n\r\nBecause the alternative is to write:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (list instanceof ArrayList) {\r\n  .. our array list efficient code here ..\r\n} else if (list instanceof LinkedList) {\r\n  .. our linked list efficient code here ..\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd even if you are willing to stomach having to rewrite that _everywhere_ you want to take &#39;any kind of list&#39;, which is the point of interfaces after all, what happens if we come up with a different kind of list implementation? Now we need to go back through the __millions__ of existing java projects out there and retroactively find all that kind of code and add another `else if instanceof` style clause to it all.\r\n\r\nHence, `removeIf` is an efficient solution to this problem, and it&#39;s a problem that you can&#39;t simply solve by relying on `iterator()`, `iterator().remove()`, `.remove(idx)`, and `.remove(value)`.\r\n\r\n## STANDARD `LinkedList` DISCLAIMER\r\n\r\nYou might walk away from this lesson thinking that LinkedList is, or at least can often be, more efficient than `ArrayList`.\r\n\r\n__That is an incorrect conclusion__. LinkedList is bad and should never be used unless you are smart enough to know enough to know this is one of the exceedingly exotic cases where it really is the right answer.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the costs inherent to using linkedlists have a lot to do with CPU architecture and a very basic algorithmic-complexity analysis of the code cannot help you figure out thoe costs. And computers are really, really fast - you need very large lists indeed (tens of thousands, minimum) for linkedlist to be faster even for academic perfect cases for it.\r\n\r\nEven then, __if__ LinkedList is a better answer than ArrayList, in those cases often some other datatype (such as a concurrent list, or an ArrayDeque, or a HashMap) are an _even_ better answer.
