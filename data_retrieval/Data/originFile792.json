It states:\r\n\r\n&gt; *&quot;This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of\r\n&gt; this object&#39;s monitor. A thread becomes the owner of the object&#39;s\r\n&gt; monitor in one of three ways:*\r\n&gt; 1. *By executing a `synchronized` instance method of that object.*\r\n&gt; 2. *By executing the body of a `synchronized` statement that synchronizes on the object.*\r\n&gt; 3. *For objects of type `Class`, by executing a `synchronized static` method of that class.&quot;*\r\n\r\nBut your real question is *why* is it necessary?  *Why* did they design it this way?\r\n\r\nTo answer that, we need to understand that Java&#39;s `wait` / `notify` mechanism is *primarily* designed for implementing [*condition variables*][2].  The purpose of a condition variable is to allow one thread to wait for a condition to become true and for another thread to notify it that this has occurred.  The basic pattern for implementing condition variables using `wait()` / `notify()` is as follows:\r\n\r\n    // Shared lock that provides mutual exclusion for &#39;theCondition&#39;.\r\n    final Object lock = new Object();\r\n\r\n    // Thread #1\r\n    synchronized (lock) {\r\n        // ...\r\n        while (! theCondition) {  // One reason for this loop will\r\n                                  // become later ...\r\n            lock.wait();\r\n        }\r\n        // HERE\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Thread # 2\r\n    synchronized (lock) {\r\n        // ...\r\n        if (theCondition) {\r\n            lock.notify();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis when thread #1 reaches `// HERE`, it knows that `theCondition` is now true.  Furthermore it is guaranteed the current values variables that make up the condition, and any others controlled by the `lock` monitor will now be visible to thread #1.\r\n\r\nBut one of the prerequisites for this actually working is that both thread #1 and thread #2 are synchronized on the same monitor.  That will guarantee the visibility of the values according to a *happens before* analysis based on the Java Memory Model (see JLS 17.4).\r\n\r\nA second reason that the above needs synchronization is because thread #1 needs exclusive access to the variables to check the condition and then use them.  Without mutual exclusion for the shared state between threads #1 and #2, race conditions are possible that can lead to a missed notification.\r\n\r\nSince the above only works reliably when threads #1 and #2 hold the monitor when calling `wait` and `notify`, the Java designers decided to *enforce* this in implementations of the `wait` and `notify` methods themselves.  Hence the javadoc that I quoted above.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nNow ... your use-case for `wait()` / `notify()` is simpler.  No information is shared between the two threads ... apart from the fact that the notify occurred.  But it is still necessary to follow the pattern above.  \r\n\r\nConsider the consequences of this caveat in the [javadoc][3] for the `wait()` methods:\r\n\r\n&gt; *&quot;A thread can wake up without being notified, interrupted, or timing out, a so-called &quot;spurious wakeup&quot;. While this will rarely occur in practice, applications must guard against it ...&quot;*\r\n\r\nSo one issue is that a spurious wakeup could cause the child thread to be woken before the main thread&#39;s `sleep(...)` completes.\r\n\r\nA second issue is that is the child thread is delayed, the main thread may `notify` the child before the child has reached the `wait`.  The notification then be lost.  (This might happen due to system load.) \r\n\r\nWhat these issues mean is that your example is **incorrect** ... in theory, if not in reality.  And in fact, it is not possible to solve your problem using wait / notify without following the pattern above/\r\n\r\nA corrected version of your example (i.e. one that is not vulnerable to spurious wakeups, and race conditions) looks like this:\r\n\r\n    final Object lock = new Object;\r\n    boolean wakeUp = false;\r\n    \r\n    Thread thread = new Thread(() -&gt; {\r\n        synchronized (lock){\r\n            try {\r\n                while (!wakeUp) {\r\n                    this.wait();\r\n                }\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Woke&quot;);\r\n            } catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n                throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    });\r\n    thread.start();\r\n    TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);\r\n    synchronized (lock) {\r\n        wakeUp = true;\r\n        this.notify();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote that there are simpler and more obviously correct ways to do this using various `java.concurrent.*` classes.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html#notify()\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization)#Condition_variables_2\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html#wait(long,int)\r\n","title":"Why calling notify in Java requires holding the lock?","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>I think the holding the lock is not necessary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is necessary <strong>because</strong> the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html#notify()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">javadoc</a> for <code>Object.notify()</code> says it is necessary.

Then, you run a command like\n  the following:</p>\n  \n  <p>storm jar all-my-code.jar backtype.storm.MyTopology arg1 arg2</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You may have to use some packaging tool like, OneJAR, JarJar or ANT and create a jar containing all your files and dependencies.

And I see <code>java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: Table 'task-db.customer' doesn't exist</code> in the application log. But after building the project, I could see the customer table created via Flyway. So the table does exist before starting the application.</p>\n<p>I tried rebuilding/invalidating cache and restarting intellij but did not help.The only fly configuration I have used is -<code>flyway:locations: classpath:db/migration</code>. Below is the DDL in the flyway init script.</p>\n<pre><code>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `CUSTOMER` (\n`CUSTOMER_ID` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\n`FIRST_NAME` varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL,\n PRIMARY KEY (`CUSTOMER_ID`)\n);` \n</code></pre>\n<p>How can I resolve it? Where should I be looking at? Am I missing something?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","hibernate","spring-data-jpa"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":11165107,"reputation":453,"user_id":8194026,"display_name":"John Mitchell"},"score":1,"creation_date":1671546465,"post_id":74864477,"comment_id":132119236,"body_markdown":"Need to show also your configuration classes, including the main class with `@SpringBootApplication`.
