The size of this buffer is configured by the <code>confirmationWindowSize</code> parameter, when the server has received <code>confirmationWindowSize</code> bytes of commands and processed them it will send back a command confirmation to the client, and the client can then free up space in the buffer.</p>\n<p>Setting this parameter to <code>-1</code> disables any buffering and prevents any re-attachment from occurring, forcing reconnect instead. The default value for this parameter is <code>-1</code>. (Which means by default no auto re-attachment will occur)</p>\n<p>Please see Apache ActiveMQ Artemis documentation for more details:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The &quot;Asynchronous Send Acknowledgements&quot; section of <a href=\"https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/send-guarantees.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/send-guarantees.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/client-reconnection.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/client-reconnection.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/perf-tools.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/perf-tools.html</a></li>\n</ol>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":3771485,"reputation":1705,"user_id":3133542,"accept_rate":95,"display_name":"user3133542"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":406,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58442616,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1696364058,"creation_date":1525980340,"question_id":50280156,"body_markdown":"I want to publish a simple topic to a topic queue.

Using a String format for everything also failed.

Because this check is placed in `onCreate`, it will only be executed once. This means that the same set of click listeners will be executed every time, resulting in the numeric value always being concatenated to the `num1` string.\r\n\r\nSo when you press the button &quot;7&quot; you will have `num1 = &quot;07&quot;`, then when you press the button &quot;+&quot;, it will append &quot; + &quot; to your `text` (`TextView`) and then when you press the button &quot;7&quot; again, you will have `num1 = &quot;077&quot;`. Converting a `String` with value `&quot;077&quot;` to a `double`/`Double` will result in the value `77.0`.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to keep just one set of click listeners and do the radio button check inside them.

B extends A.\r\nIn equals method defined inside a the check is - **o instance of A** \r\nlet&#39;s say a is an object of A, b is an object of B. The result of instanceof operator will hold true for a.equals(b) but will be false for b.equals(a) hence  no symmetry in outcome. To avoid that you can use getClass() that will make a.equals(b) false as well and will only hold true when both objects are either of type A or B. \r\n\r\nQuoting from the book: **5.2.3 Equality Testing and inheritance**\r\nThe java language specification requires that the Equals method has following properties:\r\nIt is reflexive. . .\r\nsymmetric, transtive, consistent.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut that is up to your requirements :)","title":"Java method arguments: type declaration in parentheses?","body":"<p>I think you might have mistyped one thing in your question.\nWhen you say:\n<strong>When I first wrote the equals_helper method, I left out the parentheses in the type declaration</strong></p>\n<p>and then you mention\n<strong>The IDE suggested that I put a parentheses around the type declaration (i.e. equals_helper(LinkedListDeque o) to equals_helper((LinkedListDeque) o))</strong></p>\n<p>So, what I see <strong>equals_helper((LinkedListDeque) o))</strong> is not part of equals_helper method but when you are invoking equals_helper method inside <strong>equals</strong> method.

I would recommend going through the book <strong>CoreJava Volume 1</strong> topic <strong>5.2.2 The equals Method</strong> There are whole set of guidelines for righting equals method more efficiently and the casting is also discussed there in more detail. I am mentioning some of it here.</p>\n<p>you can include a null pointer check\nif (o == null) return false;</p>\n<p>a quick reference check\nif (this == o) return true;</p>\n<p>if you want comparision between objects of LinkedListDeque and not of sub type you can use getClass() method\nif (getClass()!=o.getClass()) return false</p>\n<p>note that you're using instance of operator which works one way or downstream and it will not hold the symmetry:</p>\n<p>Let's assume A is a class where equals is defined. B extends A.\nIn equals method defined inside a the check is - <strong>o instance of A</strong>\nlet's say a is an object of A, b is an object of B. The result of instanceof operator will hold true for a.equals(b) but will be false for b.equals(a) hence  no symmetry in outcome. To avoid that you can use getClass() that will make a.equals(b) false as well and will only hold true when both objects are either of type A or B.</p>\n<p>Quoting from the book: <strong>5.2.3 Equality Testing and inheritance</strong>\nThe java language specification requires that the Equals method has following properties:\nIt is reflexive. . .\nsymmetric, transtive, consistent.</p>\n<p>But that is up to your requirements :)</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":12024322,"reputation":49,"user_id":8796778,"display_name":"jmc"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":79,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":77223896,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1696352854,"creation_date":1696346813,"question_id":77223608,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m implementing a `LinkedListDeque` data structure.

When I attempt to compile/build my project with `mvn clean install -fae`, I get the following errors. These show up for a specific sub-module of my project, which has its own pom.xml.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] /…/katharis/CustomKatharsisConfigV3.java:[74,34] cannot access javax.servlet.Filter\r\n  class file for javax.servlet.Filter not found\r\n[ERROR]  /…/katharis/CustomKatharsisConfigV3.java:[75,32] type argument io.katharsis.spring.KatharsisFilterV2 is not within bounds of type-variable T\r\n[ERROR]  /…/katharis/CustomKatharsisConfigV3.java:[75,84] incompatible types: cannot infer type arguments for org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.FilterRegistrationBean&lt;&gt;\r\n    reason: inference variable T has incompatible bounds\r\n      equality constraints: io.katharsis.spring.KatharsisFilterV2\r\n      lower bounds: jakarta.servlet.Filter\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I don&#39;t have access to the `io.katharsis.spring.KatharsisFilterV2` class in question. And that project hasn&#39;t been updated since 2017!\r\n\r\nAt first, I tried to switch from `katharsis` to `crnk`, its successor. However, I ran into the same `javax` vs `jakarta` issue: https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-framework/issues/869 (issue opened in December 2022).\r\n\r\nUltimately, I&#39;d like to contribute to the `crnk` project and see it updated.

solving this issue, if you want to see more of the source code you can look it at: https://github.com/guilhermepereira2917/SettingMusicoterapia.\r\n\r\nAdded the following remote command on **inputConverter.xhtml**:\r\n```xhtml\r\n&lt;p:remoteCommand name=&quot;#{cc.id}&quot; action=&quot;#{cc.attrs.retornoAction}&quot; immediate=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSwitched dialog return ajax of **inputConverter.xhtml** for calling:\r\n```xhtml\r\n&lt;p:ajax event=&quot;dialogReturn&quot; listener=&quot;#{buscaBean.resultadoPesquisaInputConverter}&quot;\r\n        oncomplete=&quot;#{cc.id}()&quot;/&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreated the session scoped bean **BuscaBean.java** with the following attribute and method:\r\n```java\r\npublic static &lt;T&gt; void resultadoPesquisaInputConverter(SelectEvent&lt;T&gt; event) {\r\n    objetoSelecionado = event.getObject();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd grabbed the selected object of the dialog through the called method of the remote command:\r\n```java\r\n@Inject\r\nprivate BuscaBean buscaBean;\r\n\r\npublic void selecionaNacionalidade() {\r\n    objetoCrud.setPaisNacionalidade(buscaBean.getResultadoPesquisa(Pais.class));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the way I use my input converter at the end looks like this:\r\n```xhtml\r\n&lt;custom:inputConverter \r\n    labelValue=&quot;Pa&#237;s&quot;                                \r\n    inputObject=&quot;#{pacienteBean.paciente.paisNacionalidade}&quot;\r\n    inputId=&quot;#{pacienteBean.paciente.paisNacionalidade.id}&quot;\r\n    inputValue=&quot;#{pacienteBean.paciente.paisNacionalidade.nome}&quot;\r\n    buscaAction=&quot;#{buscaBean.abrirBuscaPaises}&quot;\r\n    retornoAction=&quot;#{pacienteBean.selecionaNacionalidade}&quot;\r\n    limpaAction=&quot;#{pacienteBean.limpaNacionalidade}&quot;\r\n
