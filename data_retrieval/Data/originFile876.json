Anybody have any ideas what the issue could be.</p>\n<p>I checked the xfm application log xfm.odl.XXXXXXFM-1 and there seems to be an error in the parser</p>\n<pre><code>[2020-06-18T14:41:09.851832+00:00] [XFM] [ERROR:1] [EPMHFM-00000] [XFM] [ecid: 0000NB7s5pr3JByr04zW6F1UurLA000009] [File: c:\\nsh00dph_build_view\\hfm\\source\\session\\xfmdata\\cxfmdatafileparser.cpp] [Line: 233] [userId: ] [Msg arguments: ] [appName: XXXXXXFM] [pid: 7132] [tid: 9908] [host: WIN-V6SE6NGK443] [nwaddr: [fe80::1933:e8b7:9c66:f8e0%5]:0;[fe80::1851:3b40:ff89:4a96%6]:0;[fe80::3d62:44ba:7543:5157%2]:0;[2a04:3541:1000:500:1933:e8b7:9c66:f8e0]:0;169.254.248.224:0;94.237.48.41:0;10.2.2.89:0;] [errorCode: 0] [srcException: XfmExc] [errType: 1] [dbUpdate: 1] [11.2.1.0.000.5410]\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","sql","database","android-room"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":6077735,"reputation":52951,"user_id":4744514,"accept_rate":96,"display_name":"MikeT"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1668736049,"creation_date":1668709347,"answer_id":74480349,"question_id":74477964,"body_markdown":"First things to do is create the `@Entity` annotated classes according to the schema of the database. That is, each `@Entity` reflects a table.\r\n\r\nWhen you have these classes then create the `@Database` annotated class with all of the `@Entity` annotated classes in the list of entities of the entities parameter of the `@Database` annotation. You then compile (successfully) and the java(generated) will have a class named the same as the @Database annotated class BUT suffixed with `_Impl`. Within this class there will be a method called `createAllTables`. This will contain the **EXACT** SQL for the creation of the tables. **It is important that the database schema matches this SQL** (otherwise you will get an exception saying that the schema&#39;s do not match with the message detailing what Room expected and what was actually found).\r\n\r\nIf there are differences then you need to convert the database accordingly (it is suggested that you use the generated SQL to create new tables, load the new tables with the data from the original tables, then rename (or if confident drop them) original tables and then rename the new tables to the original names). You will then have a database with the schema according to Room&#39;s expectations.\r\n\r\nYou can then create an assets folder/directory in the project and copy the database into that folder and then add the `createFromAsset` method to the @Database. Room will copy the database from the assets folder via this method.\r\n\r\nHowever, before running you would probably want to create some `@Dao` annotated interfaces (or abstract classes which have the advantage of allowing methods with bodies which can be useful) with methods appropriate for your project.\r\n\r\nYou may find this helpful:-\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70580333/move-data-from-sqlite-database-file-to-room/70584194#70584194\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nYou say\r\n\r\n&gt; .sql file, because I didn&#39;t establish to convert it to a .db file\r\n\r\nThe extension doesn&#39;t matter (as long as it&#39;s a valid file name) and the full file name is specified as the parameter passed to the `createFromAsset` method. \r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Working Example**\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**The existing database**\r\n\r\nFor this example the existing database consists of 3 tables:-\r\n\r\n- the **user** table with 3 columns:-\r\n    - **userid** (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL) i.e. unique identifier\r\n    - **username** a textual type **BUT** defined using a type as ***NOTAROOMKNOWNTYPE*** (a type as it says that Room will not allow)\r\n    - **useremail** with a type of TEXT\r\n\r\n- the **meeting** table with 4 columns:-\r\n    - **meetingid** (again INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL)\r\n    - **meetingname** with a type of TEXT\r\n    - **startdatetime** with a type of integer (intended for a time stamp)\r\n    - **enddatetime** with a type of integer (again timestamp)\r\n\r\n- the **usermeetingmap** table with 2 columns to enable a many-many relationship between user and meeting (a user can attend many meetings and a meeting can have many users)\r\n    - **usermap** with a type of LONG (not supported/known by room)\r\n    - **meetingmap** likewise.\r\n\r\nThe following is the SQL used to create the tables, populate them with some data and also to extract the data:-\r\n\r\n    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS usermeetingmap;\r\n    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user;\r\n    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS meeting;\r\n    \r\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user (\r\n      userid INTEGER,\r\n      username NOTAROOMKNOWNTYPE,\r\n      useremail TEXT,\r\n      PRIMARY KEY (userid)\r\n    );\r\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS meeting (\r\n      meetingid INTEGER,\r\n      meetingname TEXT,\r\n      startdatetime integer,\r\n      enddatetime integer,\r\n      PRIMARY KEY (meetingid)\r\n    );\r\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS usermeetingmap (\r\n      usermap LONG NOT NULL,\r\n      meetingmap LONG NOT NULL,\r\n      PRIMARY KEY (usermap, meetingmap),\r\n      FOREIGN KEY (usermap) REFERENCES user (userid) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,\r\n      FOREIGN KEY (meetingmap) REFERENCES meeting (meetingid) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE\r\n    );\r\n    \r\n    DELETE FROM usermeetingmap;\r\n    DELETE FROM user;\r\n    DELETE FROM meeting;\r\n    INSERT INTO user VALUES \r\n    \t(1,&#39;User1&#39;,&#39;user1@mail.com&#39;),\r\n    \t(2,&#39;User2&#39;,&#39;user2@hotmail.com&#39;),\r\n    \t(3,&#39;User3&#39;,&#39;user3@gmail.com&#39;),\r\n    \t(4,&#39;User4&#39;,&#39;user4@yandex.com&#39;)\r\n    ;\r\n    INSERT  OR IGNORE INTO meeting VALUES\r\n    \t(100,&#39;Meeting1&#39;,strftime(&#39;%s&#39;,&#39;now&#39;,&#39;-7 days&#39;),strftime(&#39;%s&#39;,&#39;now&#39;,&#39;-7 days&#39;,&#39;+3 hours&#39;)),\r\n    \t(200,&#39;Meeting2&#39;,strftime(&#39;%s&#39;,&#39;now&#39;,&#39;-6 days&#39;,&#39;+1 hour&#39;),strftime(&#39;%s&#39;,&#39;now&#39;,&#39;-6 day&#39;,&#39;+4 hours&#39;)),\r\n    \t(300,&#39;Meeting3&#39;,strftime(&#39;%s&#39;,&#39;now&#39;,&#39;-5 days&#39;,&#39;+2 hour&#39;),strftime(&#39;%s&#39;,&#39;now&#39;,&#39;-5 day&#39;,&#39;+5 hours&#39;)),\r\n    \t(400,&#39;Meeting3&#39;,strftime(&#39;%s&#39;,&#39;now&#39;,&#39;-4 days&#39;,&#39;+3 hour&#39;),strftime(&#39;%s&#39;,&#39;now&#39;,&#39;-4 day&#39;,&#39;+6 hours&#39;))\r\n    ;\r\n    INSERT OR IGNORE INTO usermeetingmap VALUES\r\n    \t(1,100),(3,100),\r\n    \t(2,200),(4,200),\r\n    \t(1,300),(2,300),(3,300),(4,300)\r\n    ;\r\n    \r\n    SELECT \r\n    \tuser.username,user.useremail, \r\n    \tmeeting.meetingname, \r\n    \tdatetime(meeting.startdatetime,&#39;unixepoch&#39;) AS starts,\r\n    \tdatetime(meeting.enddatetime,&#39;unixepoch&#39;) AS ends FROM user \r\n    \tJOIN usermeetingmap ON user.userid = usermeetingmap.usermap\r\n    \tJOIN meeting ON usermeetingmap.meetingmap = meeting.meetingid\r\n    ORDER BY meetingid\r\n    ;\r\n\r\nThe result of the query:-\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n**Step 1 - Create the `@Entity` annotated classes**\r\n\r\n- **Note** I suggest writing 1 @Entity annotated class at a time, then compiling (CTRL + F9) to see if there are an reported issues.\r\n    - You could also inspect the generated java and make notes of any discrepancies between the existing database and the room database.\r\n\r\n**Step 1.1 Create the User class**\r\n\r\nFrom the above we know that the User table should have 3 columns, the primary key being the **userid** column. **Room** requires that all tables have a primary key (it does not support WITHOUT ROWID tables).\r\n\r\nSo the **User** class could be:-\r\n\r\n    @Entity\r\n    class User {\r\n        @PrimaryKey\r\n        Long userid=null;\r\n        String username; /* NOTE CANNOT USE NOTAROOMKNOWNTYPE as we know it&#39;s a TEXT type then java String type */\r\n        String useremail;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nTo test this the **`@Database`** annotated class will now be added to suit this single table e.g.:-\r\n\r\n    @Database( entities = {User.class}, exportSchema = false, version = 1)\r\n    abstract class TheDatabase extends RoomDatabase {\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf the project is compiled (successfully i.e. it is suggested that you ALWAYS check the build log) then you can compare the SQL of the User table that Room expects e.g. :-\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nIn this case we compare the two (Room SQL with Original SQL/schema):-\r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `User` (`userid` INTEGER, `username` TEXT, `useremail` TEXT, PRIMARY KEY(`userid`))\r\n\r\nand \r\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user (userid INTEGER,username NOTAROOMKNOWNTYPE,useremail TEXT,PRIMARY KEY (userid));\r\n\r\n- They differ\r\n    - the **username** column has TEXT v NOTAROOMKNOWNTYPE. **THIS MUST BE CHANGED TO SUIT ROOM** \r\n\r\n    - note that Room encloses all table/column names in `&#39;s that just ensures that the names are taken as names.\r\n\r\n**Step 1.2 Meeting class** first attempt:-\r\n\r\n    @Entity\r\n    class Meeting {\r\n        @PrimaryKey\r\n        Long meetingid=null;\r\n        String meetingname;\r\n        long startdatetime;\r\n        long enddatetime;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen amend the **TheDatabase** to include the new entity:-\r\n\r\n    @Database( entities = {User.class,Meeting.class}, exportSchema = false, version = 1)\r\n\r\nAgain compare SQL (Room v original):-\r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Meeting` (`meetingid` INTEGER, `meetingname` TEXT, `startdatetime` INTEGER NOT NULL, `enddatetime` INTEGER NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(`meetingid`))\r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS meeting (meetingid INTEGER,meetingname TEXT,startdatetime integer,enddatetime integer,PRIMARY KEY (meetingid));\r\n\r\n- **There is a difference** Room has added the NOT NULL constraint for the startdatetime and enddatetime columns. Room would not accept this. So something has to be changed.\r\n\r\n    - for primitives (long in this case) Room will always add a NOT NULL constraint. A way around this is to instead use an Object. In this case Long instead of Long.\r\n\r\nSo the **Meeting** class can be changed to :-\r\n\r\n    @Entity\r\n    class Meeting {\r\n        @PrimaryKey\r\n        Long meetingid=null;\r\n        String meetingname;\r\n        Long startdatetime;\r\n        Long enddatedate;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd after Compiling then Room&#39;s generated SQL is now:-\r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Meeting` (`meetingid` INTEGER, `meetingname` TEXT, `startdatetime` INTEGER, `enddatetime` INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY(`meetingid`))\r\n\r\n\r\n**Step 1.3 UserMeetingMap class**\r\n\r\n    @Entity(\r\n            /* @Primary can only be used to annotated a single member/column as a composite primary key is required then */\r\n            primaryKeys = {&quot;usermap&quot;,&quot;meetingmap&quot;},\r\n            /* As Foreign Key constraints have been used then */\r\n            foreignKeys = {\r\n                    @ForeignKey(\r\n                            entity = User.class,\r\n                            parentColumns = {&quot;userid&quot;},\r\n                            childColumns = {&quot;usermap&quot;},\r\n                            onDelete = ForeignKey.CASCADE,\r\n                            onUpdate = ForeignKey.CASCADE\r\n                    ),\r\n                    @ForeignKey(\r\n                            entity = Meeting.class,\r\n                            parentColumns = {&quot;meetingid&quot;},\r\n                            childColumns = {&quot;meetingmap&quot;},\r\n                            onDelete = ForeignKey.CASCADE,\r\n                            onUpdate = ForeignKey.CASCADE\r\n                    )\r\n            }\r\n    )\r\n    class UserMeetingMap {\r\n        long usermap;\r\n        long meetingmap;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nthe `@Database` annotation is changed to:-\r\n\r\n    @Database( entities = {User.class,Meeting.class,UserMeetingMap.class}, exportSchema = false, version = 1)\r\n\r\nAfter compiling then the Room v Original SQL is:-\r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `UserMeetingMap` (`usermap` INTEGER NOT NULL, `meetingmap` INTEGER NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(`usermap`, `meetingmap`), FOREIGN KEY(`usermap`) REFERENCES `User`(`userid`) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE , FOREIGN KEY(`meetingmap`) REFERENCES `Meeting`(`meetingid`) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE )\r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS usermeetingmap (usermap LONG NOT NULL,meetingmap LONG NOT NULL,PRIMARY KEY (usermap, meetingmap),FOREIGN KEY (usermap) REFERENCES user (userid) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,FOREIGN KEY (meetingmap) REFERENCES meeting (meetingid) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE);\r\n\r\nAs can be seen the original has type LONG rather than INTEGER, **THIS MUST BE CHANGED**.\r\n\r\n\r\n**STEP 2 Converting the original database**\r\n\r\nUsing the approach we can see that unless the database is converted that Room will reject the database as not being the expected database. As such, due to Room&#39;s requirements the original database **MUST BE ALTERED ACCORDINGLY**.\r\n\r\nIn summary the unacceptable ***NOTAROOMKNOWNTYPE*** must be changed to **TEXT** and the two occurrences of ***LONG*** must be changed to **INTEGER**.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way is to use an SQLite tool and:-\r\n\r\n 1. Rename the original tables\r\n 2. Create the new tables by copying the generated SQL (i.e. Room&#39;s expected tables)\r\n 3. Per table, use INSERT INTO table SELECT * FROM original_table;\r\n     1. Note that if using Foreign Keys (and not deferring or turning off foreign key support) then parent tables must be loaded before children. \r\n 1. Drop the original tables\r\n 1. Optionally, but suggested, VACUUM\r\n 1. Save the database\r\n\r\n\r\ne.g. for this demo the following was used:-\r\n\r\n    /* Just in case */\r\n    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS original_usermeetingmap;\r\n    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS original_user;\r\n    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS original_meeting;\r\n    ALTER TABLE user RENAME TO original_user;\r\n    ALTER TABLE meeting RENAME TO original_meeting;\r\n    ALTER TABLE usermeetingmap RENAME TO original_usermeetingmap;\r\n    \r\n    /* COPY ROOM GENERATE SQL HERE */\r\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `User` (`userid` INTEGER, `username` TEXT, `useremail` TEXT, PRIMARY KEY(`userid`));\r\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Meeting` (`meetingid` INTEGER, `meetingname` TEXT, `startdatetime` INTEGER, `enddatetime` INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY(`meetingid`));\r\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `UserMeetingMap` (`usermap` INTEGER NOT NULL, `meetingmap` INTEGER NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(`usermap`, `meetingmap`), FOREIGN KEY(`usermap`) REFERENCES `User`(`userid`) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE , FOREIGN KEY(`meetingmap`) REFERENCES `Meeting`(`meetingid`) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE );\r\n    /* COPY THE DATA */\r\n    INSERT INTO user SELECT * FROM original_user;\r\n    INSERT INTO meeting SELECT * FROM original_meeting;\r\n    INSERT INTO usermeetingmap SELECT * FROM original_usermeetingmap;\r\n    /* JUST CHECKING */\r\n    SELECT \r\n    \tuser.username,user.useremail, \r\n    \tmeeting.meetingname, \r\n    \tdatetime(meeting.startdatetime,&#39;unixepoch&#39;) AS starts,\r\n    \tdatetime(meeting.enddatetime,&#39;unixepoch&#39;) AS ends FROM user \r\n    \tJOIN usermeetingmap ON user.userid = usermeetingmap.usermap\r\n    \tJOIN meeting ON usermeetingmap.meetingmap = meeting.meetingid\r\n    ORDER BY meetingid\r\n    ;\r\n    /* ONCE TESTED AS 100% OK uncomment following */\r\n    /*DROP TABLE IF EXISTS original_usermeetingmap;*/\r\n    /*DROP TABLE IF EXISTS original_user;*/\r\n    /*DROP TABLE IF EXISTS original_meeting;*/\r\n    /*VACUUM; to tidy up storage/free space */\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**STEP 3 Preparing the Converted database**\r\n\r\nCreate the assets folder.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nCopy the saved database, renaming if/as you want, into the assets folder (example where it has been renamed to the stupid file name `anything.anything`).\r\n\r\nAmend the **TheDatabase** class (as one way) to provide a built (Rooms terminology) adatabase using the `createFromAsset` method e.g.\r\n\r\n    @Database( entities = {User.class,Meeting.class,UserMeetingMap.class}, exportSchema = false, version = 1)\r\n    abstract class TheDatabase extends RoomDatabase {\r\n    \r\n        private static volatile TheDatabase INSTANCE;\r\n    \r\n        public static TheDatabase getInstance(Context context) {\r\n            if (INSTANCE==null) {\r\n                INSTANCE = Room.databaseBuilder(context,TheDatabase.class,&quot;the_database_.xyz&quot;)\r\n                        .allowMainThreadQueries() /* for brevity of demo */\r\n                        .createFromAsset(&quot;anything.anything&quot;)\r\n                        .build();\r\n            }\r\n            return INSTANCE;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n- **NOTE** the parameter for the `createFromAsset` method.

That is, each <code>@Entity</code> reflects a table.</p>\n<p>When you have these classes then create the <code>@Database</code> annotated class with all of the <code>@Entity</code> annotated classes in the list of entities of the entities parameter of the <code>@Database</code> annotation. You then compile (successfully) and the java(generated) will have a class named the same as the @Database annotated class BUT suffixed with <code>_Impl</code>. Within this class there will be a method called <code>createAllTables</code>. This will contain the <strong>EXACT</strong> SQL for the creation of the tables. <strong>It is important that the database schema matches this SQL</strong> (otherwise you will get an exception saying that the schema's do not match with the message detailing what Room expected and what was actually found).</p>\n<p>If there are differences then you need to convert the database accordingly (it is suggested that you use the generated SQL to create new tables, load the new tables with the data from the original tables, then rename (or if confident drop them) original tables and then rename the new tables to the original names). You will then have a database with the schema according to Room's expectations.</p>\n<p>You can then create an assets folder/directory in the project and copy the database into that folder and then add the <code>createFromAsset</code> method to the @Database. Room will copy the database from the assets folder via this method.</p>\n<p>However, before running you would probably want to create some <code>@Dao</code> annotated interfaces (or abstract classes which have the advantage of allowing methods with bodies which can be useful) with methods appropriate for your project.</p>\n<p>You may find this helpful:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70580333/move-data-from-sqlite-database-file-to-room/70584194#70584194\">Move data from sqlite database file to room</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>You say</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>.sql file, because I didn't establish to convert it to a .db file</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The extension doesn't matter (as long as it's a valid file name) and the full file name is specified as the parameter passed to the <code>createFromAsset</code> method.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Working Example</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>The existing database</strong></p>\n<p>For this example the existing database consists of 3 tables:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>the <strong>user</strong> table with 3 columns:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>userid</strong> (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL) i.e. unique identifier</li>\n<li><strong>username</strong> a textual type <strong>BUT</strong> defined using a type as <em><strong>NOTAROOMKNOWNTYPE</strong></em> (a type as it says that Room will not allow)</li>\n<li><strong>useremail</strong> with a type of TEXT</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>the <strong>meeting</strong> table with 4 columns:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>meetingid</strong> (again INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL)</li>\n<li><strong>meetingname</strong> with a type of TEXT</li>\n<li><strong>startdatetime</strong> with a type of integer (intended for a time stamp)</li>\n<li><strong>enddatetime</strong> with a type of integer (again timestamp)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p>the <strong>usermeetingmap</strong> table with 2 columns to enable a many-many relationship between user and meeting (a user can attend many meetings and a meeting can have many users)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>usermap</strong> with a type of LONG (not supported/known by room)</li>\n<li><strong>meetingmap</strong> likewise.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following is the SQL used to create the tables, populate them with some data and also to extract the data:-</p>\n<pre><code>DROP TABLE IF EXISTS usermeetingmap;\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS user;\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS meeting;\n\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user (\n  userid INTEGER,\n  username NOTAROOMKNOWNTYPE,\n  useremail TEXT,\n  PRIMARY KEY (userid)\n);\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS meeting (\n  meetingid INTEGER,\n  meetingname TEXT,\n  startdatetime integer,\n  enddatetime integer,\n  PRIMARY KEY (meetingid)\n);\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS usermeetingmap (\n  usermap LONG NOT NULL,\n  meetingmap LONG NOT NULL,\n  PRIMARY KEY (usermap, meetingmap),\n  FOREIGN KEY (usermap) REFERENCES user (userid) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,\n  FOREIGN KEY (meetingmap) REFERENCES meeting (meetingid) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE\n);\n\nDELETE FROM usermeetingmap;\nDELETE FROM user;\nDELETE FROM meeting;\nINSERT INTO user VALUES \n    (1,'User1','user1@mail.com'),\n    (2,'User2','user2@hotmail.com'),\n    (3,'User3','user3@gmail.com'),\n    (4,'User4','user4@yandex.com')\n;\nINSERT  OR IGNORE INTO meeting VALUES\n    (100,'Meeting1',strftime('%s','now','-7 days'),strftime('%s','now','-7 days','+3 hours')),\n    (200,'Meeting2',strftime('%s','now','-6 days','+1 hour'),strftime('%s','now','-6 day','+4 hours')),\n    (300,'Meeting3',strftime('%s','now','-5 days','+2 hour'),strftime('%s','now','-5 day','+5 hours')),\n    (400,'Meeting3',strftime('%s','now','-4 days','+3 hour'),strftime('%s','now','-4 day','+6 hours'))\n;\nINSERT OR IGNORE INTO usermeetingmap VALUES\n    (1,100),(3,100),\n    (2,200),(4,200),\n    (1,300),(2,300),(3,300),(4,300)\n;\n\nSELECT \n    user.username,user.useremail, \n    meeting.meetingname, \n    datetime(meeting.startdatetime,'unixepoch') AS starts,\n    datetime(meeting.enddatetime,'unixepoch') AS ends FROM user \n    JOIN usermeetingmap ON user.userid = usermeetingmap.usermap\n    JOIN meeting ON usermeetingmap.meetingmap = meeting.meetingid\nORDER BY meetingid\n;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The result of the query:-</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vabT2.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vabT2.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Step 1 -

A way around this is to instead use an Object.

Here maven doesn&#39;t look for the whole library, instead it asks its dependency.\r\n\r\nYou can find dependency of your external library [here][3] by searching for library with [exact version][4]. \r\n\r\n    &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n        &lt;groupId&gt;com.googlecode.json-simple&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;json-simple&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;version&gt;1.1.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n    &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\nNow you need to copy the dependency from [given site][4] and paste it to your pom.xml file within the `&lt;dependencies&gt;` element.

In this example, the full pom.xml is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\"\n         xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n         xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\n                      http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\"&gt;\n    &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;com.infy&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;user-identity-rest&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;1.0.0&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;dependencies&gt;\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\n             &lt;groupId&gt;com.googlecode.json-simple&lt;/groupId&gt;\n             &lt;artifactId&gt;json-simple&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n             &lt;version&gt;1.1.1&lt;/version&gt;\n         &lt;/dependency&gt;\n    &lt;/dependencies&gt;\n&lt;/project&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Maven will automatically fetch it from its repository.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>\nThird and last step is to build your project. Open command prompt/terminal and go to the directory where your pom.xml is declared and type <strong>mvn clean install</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mvnrepository.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WlQJG.png\" alt=\"Building application with maven\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This will generate an executable for your project on local and voilla!

Back in the day, it was quite common to hear the idea that each language (notation) had a \"sweet spot\" of applicability; sometimes the right solution was to write each part of a system in the appropriate language and link them together.</p>\n\n<p>Back to the future, anyone?</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":74486,"reputation":105478,"user_id":214010,"accept_rate":83,"display_name":"mikera"},"score":0,"creation_date":1298210458,"post_id":484483,"comment_id":5662792,"body_markdown":"+1 for hitting the nail on the head! also see my post about real paradigm shifts.","body":"+1 for hitting the nail on the head! also see my post about real paradigm shifts."}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":11354,"reputation":27694,"user_id":21838,"accept_rate":82,"display_name":"Pyrolistical"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1233079056,"creation_date":1233079056,"answer_id":484483,"question_id":484172,"body_markdown":"Those things are mostly fluff.\r\n\r\nYou need to solve some bigger issues like making concurrent code easy to design and reason about.","title":"Do we need a Java++?","body":"<p>Those things are mostly fluff.</p>\n\n<p>You need to solve some bigger issues like making concurrent code easy to design and reason about.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":155702,"reputation":1675,"user_id":372528,"accept_rate":40,"display_name":"Otto"},"score":0,"creation_date":1299435632,"post_id":484515,"comment_id":5862396,"body_markdown":"Groovy++: http://code.google.com/p/groovypptest/","body":"Groovy++: <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/groovypptest/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">code.google.com/p/groovypptest</a>"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":10836,"reputation":196641,"user_id":20654,"accept_rate":80,"display_name":"OscarRyz"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1563024262,"creation_date":1233079448,"answer_id":484515,"question_id":484172,"body_markdown":"Most of the features already exists. \r\n\r\nThat language is:\r\n\r\n\r\n[![groovy][1]][2]  \n&lt;sub&gt;(source: [codehaus.org](http://media.xircles.codehaus.org/_projects/groovy/_logos/medium.png))&lt;/sub&gt;  \n\r\n=\r\n\r\nAs for:\r\n\r\n&gt;*The ability to declare more than one class in a file.*\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s been present in java since the beginning.\r\n\r\n\n [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/dJcZg.png\n [2]: https://web.archive.org/web/20150324062712/http://groovy.codehaus.org:80/","title":"Do we need a Java++?","body":"<p>Most of the features already exists. </p>\n\n<p>That language is:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150324062712/http://groovy.codehaus.org:80/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dJcZg.png\" alt=\"groovy\"></a><br>\n<sub>(source: <a href=\"http://media.xircles.codehaus.org/_projects/groovy/_logos/medium.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">codehaus.org</a>)</sub>  </p>\n\n<p>=</p>\n\n<p>As for:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>The ability to declare more than one class in a file.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's been present in java since the beginning.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":74486,"reputation":105478,"user_id":214010,"accept_rate":83,"display_name":"mikera"},"score":3,"creation_date":1298209252,"post_id":484551,"comment_id":5662639,"body_markdown":"I think that Scala is closer to Java++ personally (JVM cross-platform capabilities plus backwards compatibility with Java libraries make it far more natural as a fit).

Perhaps functional programming could be the next big thing and Scala will be the next Java.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":65284,"reputation":91165,"user_id":192247,"accept_rate":81,"display_name":"missingfaktor"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1263271911,"creation_date":1263271911,"answer_id":2046775,"question_id":484172,"body_markdown":"[Java++][1] is already here... :D\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.scala-lang.org/","title":"Do we need a Java++?","body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.scala-lang.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Java++</a> is already here... :D</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":74486,"reputation":105478,"user_id":214010,"accept_rate":83,"display_name":"mikera"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1298210992,"creation_date":1298210359,"answer_id":5057448,"question_id":484172,"body_markdown":"These all seem like rather &quot;superficial&quot; language changes mainly motivated by developer convenience rather than fundamentally **changing the language philosophy**.\r\n\r\nIn my view, minor adjustments to syntax **don&#39;t justify** a wholesale move to a new language, especially if it means throwing away large investments in platforms, code bases and developer skillsets. \r\n\r\nThe minor changes can be added to Java language over time (in Java 7, 8, 9...) if there is sufficient demand.
