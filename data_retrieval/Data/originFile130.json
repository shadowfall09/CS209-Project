It&#39;s the updated answer to a question on how to run a Maven build within a Docker container.\r\n\r\nQuestion originally posted 8 years ago.\r\n\r\n---\r\n# Update (2023-10-12)\r\n\r\nThis answer is revised to take advantage of the new Builkit engine, which is not the default in Docker. Also includes some optional Kubernetes features.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps\r\n\r\n## 1. Generate a demo application\r\n\r\nSpring Boot demo application generated using the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)\r\n\r\nUsing the form select &quot;Maven&quot;, &quot;Java&quot; and note that today it defaults to Java 17.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n## 2. Create a Dockerfile\r\n\r\n```\r\n#\r\n# Build stage\r\n#\r\nFROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-jammy AS build\r\nENV HOME=/usr/app\r\nRUN mkdir -p $HOME\r\nWORKDIR $HOME\r\nADD . $HOME\r\nRUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.m2 ./mvnw -f $HOME/pom.xml clean package\r\n\r\n#\r\n# Package stage\r\n#\r\nFROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-jammy \r\nARG JAR_FILE=/usr/app/target/*.jar\r\nCOPY --from=build $JAR_FILE /app/runner.jar\r\nEXPOSE 8080\r\nENTRYPOINT java -jar /app/runner.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\n1. Decided on the [Eclipse Temurin](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin) java base image. There is now a rich choice of different Open JDK options today\r\n1. I prefer debian base images. You can change this choice by [looking at available tags](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin/tags?page=1&amp;name=17-jdk)\r\n1. Using the &quot;17-jre-jammy&quot; tag for second stage, to make final image smaller.\r\n1. The Spring boot initializer just needs a JDK. Maven on-board\r\n1. Note the the cache mount type. This is a [Buildkit innovation](https://docs.docker.com/build/guide/mounts/) to cache dendencies between builds \r\n\r\n## 3. Login to registry\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker login myregistry\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the generic command. Some cloud provider registries have alternative commands like:\r\n\r\n```\r\naz acr login --name my-azure-registry\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 4. Build the image\r\n\r\nBuildkit is now the default build engine in Docker. Here I use it to run  build on my Kubernetes cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n#\r\n# (Optional) Run a build pod on your k8s cluster\r\n#\r\ndocker buildx create --name my-builder --driver kubernetes --driver-opt replicas=1 --use\r\n\r\n#\r\n# Build and push the image (Buildkit &quot;buildx&quot; plugin is now part of Docker)\r\n#\r\ndocker buildx build --tag  myregistry/myorg/demo:latest --push .\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n1. Normally I&#39;d push more than just the &quot;latest&quot; tag. That is out of scope for this answer.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n\r\n * https://docs.docker.com/build/builders/\r\n * https://docs.docker.com/build/drivers/kubernetes/\r\n\r\n## 5. Run the image\r\n\r\nRun locally using Docker\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -d -p 8080:8080 myregistry/myorg/demo:latest\r\n```\r\n\r\nDeploy to Kubernetes\r\n\r\n```\r\nkubectl create ns demo\r\nkubectl -n demo create deployment demo --image=myregistry/myorg/demo:latest --port=8080 --replicas=1\r\nkubectl -n demo expose deployment demo --type=LoadBalancer\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n1. This is a demo. Not the recommended way to deploy to Kubernetes. I would use a Helm chart (again out of scope of this answer)\r\n\r\n---\r\n# Update (2019-02-22)\r\n\r\nThis answer tried to spell out the steps to run Maven within a multi-stage Dockerfile\r\n\r\n## 1. Generate an application \r\n\r\nUse the spring initializer to generate a demo app\r\n\r\nhttps://start.spring.io/\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nExtract the zip archive locally\r\n\r\n## 2. Create a Dockerfile\r\n\r\n```\r\n#\r\n# Build stage\r\n#\r\nFROM maven:3.6.0-jdk-11-slim AS build\r\nCOPY src /home/app/src\r\nCOPY pom.xml /home/app\r\nRUN mvn -f /home/app/pom.xml clean package\r\n\r\n#\r\n# Package stage\r\n#\r\nFROM openjdk:11-jre-slim\r\nCOPY --from=build /home/app/target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /usr/local/lib/demo.jar\r\nEXPOSE 8080\r\nENTRYPOINT [&quot;java&quot;,&quot;-jar&quot;,&quot;/usr/local/lib/demo.jar&quot;]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote\r\n\r\n * This example uses a [multi-stage build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/).

Using Maven plugins</strong></p>\n\n<p>Add given maven plugin in <code>pom.xml</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;plugin&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;com.spotify&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;docker-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;0.4.5&lt;/version&gt;\n        &lt;configuration&gt;\n            &lt;imageName&gt;springdocker&lt;/imageName&gt;\n            &lt;baseImage&gt;java&lt;/baseImage&gt;\n            &lt;entryPoint&gt;[\"java\", \"-jar\", \"/${project.build.finalName}.jar\"]&lt;/entryPoint&gt;\n            &lt;resources&gt;\n                &lt;resource&gt;\n                    &lt;targetPath&gt;/&lt;/targetPath&gt;\n                    &lt;directory&gt;${project.build.directory}&lt;/directory&gt;\n                    &lt;include&gt;${project.build.finalName}.jar&lt;/include&gt;\n                &lt;/resource&gt;\n            &lt;/resources&gt;\n        &lt;/configuration&gt;\n    &lt;/plugin&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Navigate to the project folder and type following command you will be able to create image and run that image:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ mvn clean package docker:build\n$ docker images\n$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -t &lt;image name&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In first example we are creating Dockerfile and providing base image and adding jar an so, after doing that we will run docker command to build an image with specific name and then run that image..</p>\n\n<p>Whereas in second example we are using maven plugin in which we providing <code>baseImage</code> and <code>imageName</code> so we don't need to create Dockerfile here.. after packaging maven project we will get the docker image and we just need to run that image..</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":6105947,"reputation":366,"user_id":6796118,"display_name":"Aschay"},"score":0,"creation_date":1617628042,"post_id":60546900,"comment_id":118348605,"body_markdown":"I log on to stackoverflow just to comment and say thank you !

You could have your own Tomcat, JBoss or Weblogic base Dockerfile that setup and configure the server.  \r\nAbout the application(s) to deploy on the server, there is not really a standard way.   \r\nA possible approach is defining a Dockerfile by application or set of applications to deploy together. The Dockerfile would have as base image the application server Dockerfile created earlier.    \r\nThat application Dockerfile would have as objective to retrieve the component (JARs/WARs/EARs) from Git or from a Maven repository manager for example and to deploy/install it/them properly on the application server.    \r\nFor huge applications (millions of line of codes) with a lot of legacy stuffs,  and so hard to migrate to a full spring boot embedded solution, that is really a nice improvement.     \r\nI will not detail more that approach since that is for minor use cases of Docker but I wanted to expose the overall idea of that approach because I think that  for developers facing to these complex cases, it is great to know that some doors are opened to integrate Docker.   \r\n\r\n**2) For applications that embed/bootstrap the server themselves (Spring Boot with server embedded : Tomcat, Netty, Jetty...)** \r\n\r\n**That is the ideal target with Docker**. \r\nI specified Spring Boot because that is a really nice framework to do that and that has also  a very high level of maintainability but in theory we could use any other Java way to achieve that.   \r\nGenerally, the idea here is to define a Docker image per application to deploy.   \r\nThe docker images for the applications produce a JAR or a set of JAR/classes/configuration files and these start a JVM with the application (java  command) when we create and start a container from these images.  \r\nFor new applications or applications not too complex to migrate, that way has to be favored over standalone servers because that is the standard way and the most efficient way of using containers.  \r\nI will detail that approach.   \r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Dockerizing a maven application&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n**1) Without Spring Boot**    \r\n\r\nThe idea is to create a fat jar with Maven (the maven assembly plugin and the maven shade plugin help for that) that contains both the compiled classes of the application and needed maven dependencies.    \r\nThen we can identify two cases :     \r\n\r\n-  if the application is a desktop or autonomous application (that doesn&#39;t need to be deployed on a server)  : we could specify as `CMD/ENTRYPOINT` in the `Dockerfile` the java execution of the application : `java -cp .:/fooPath/* -jar myJar`   \r\n\r\n-  if the application is a server application, for example Tomcat, the idea is the same : to get a fat jar of the application and to run a JVM in the `CMD/ENTRYPOINT`.  But here with an important difference : we need to include some logic and specific libraries (`org.apache.tomcat.embed` libraries and some others) that starts the embedded server when the main application is started.   \r\nWe have a comprehensive guide [on the heroku website][1].    \r\nFor the first case (autonomous application), that is a straight and efficient way to use Docker.   \r\nFor the second case (server application), that works but that is not straight,  may be error prone and is not a very extensible model because you don&#39;t place your application in the frame of a mature framework such as Spring Boot that does many of these things for you and also provides a high level of extension.       \r\nBut that has a advantage : you have a high level of freedom because you use directly the embedded Tomcat API.    \r\n\r\n**2) With Spring Boot**     \r\n\r\nAt last, here we go.   \r\nThat is both simple, efficient and very well documented.    \r\nThere are really several approaches to make a Maven/Spring Boot application to run on Docker.   \r\nExposing all of them would be long and maybe boring.     \r\nThe best choice depends on your requirement.   \r\nBut whatever the way, the build strategy in terms of docker layers looks like the same.   \r\nWe want to use a multi stage build : one relying on Maven for the dependency resolution and for build and another one relying on JDK or JRE to start the application.    \r\n\r\n**Build stage (Maven image) :** \r\n\r\n- pom copy to the image\r\n- dependencies **and** plugins downloads.   \r\nAbout that, `mvn dependency:resolve-plugins` chained to `mvn dependency:resolve` may do the job but not always.   \r\nWhy ? Because these plugins and  the `package` execution to package the fat jar may rely on different artifacts/plugins and even for a same artifact/plugin, these may still pull a different version. \r\nSo a safer approach while potentially slower is resolving dependencies by executing exactly the `mvn` command used to package the application (which will pull exactly dependencies that you are need) but by skipping the source compilation and by deleting the target folder to make the processing faster and to prevent any undesirable layer change detection for that step.  \r\n- source code copy to the image\r\n- package the application \r\n\r\nRun stage (JDK or JRE image) : \r\n\r\n- copy the jar from the previous stage\r\n- entrypoint/cmd : run the application\r\n\r\n\r\nHere two examples.   \r\n\r\n**a) A simple way without cache for downloaded maven dependencies**   \r\n\r\n\r\nDockerfile : \r\n\r\n    ########Maven build stage########\r\n    FROM maven:3.6-jdk-11 as maven_build\r\n    WORKDIR /app\r\n    \r\n    #copy pom\r\n    COPY pom.xml .\r\n    \r\n    #resolve maven dependencies\r\n    RUN mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip -Dmaven.main.skip -Dspring-boot.repackage.skip &amp;&amp; rm -r target/\r\n    \r\n    #copy source\r\n    COPY src ./src\r\n    \r\n    # build the app (no dependency download here)\r\n    RUN mvn clean package  -Dmaven.test.skip\r\n\r\n    # split the built app into multiple layers to improve layer rebuild\r\n    RUN mkdir -p target/docker-packaging &amp;&amp; cd target/docker-packaging &amp;&amp; jar -xf ../my-app*.jar\r\n    \r\n    ########JRE run stage########\r\n    FROM openjdk:11.0-jre\r\n    WORKDIR /app\r\n    \r\n    #copy built app layer by layer\r\n    ARG DOCKER_PACKAGING_DIR=/app/target/docker-packaging\r\n    COPY --from=maven_build ${DOCKER_PACKAGING_DIR}/BOOT-INF/lib /app/lib\r\n    COPY --from=maven_build ${DOCKER_PACKAGING_DIR}/BOOT-INF/classes /app/classes\r\n    COPY --from=maven_build ${DOCKER_PACKAGING_DIR}/META-INF /app/META-INF\r\n    \r\n    #run the app\r\n    CMD java -cp .:classes:lib/* \\\r\n             -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom \\\r\n             foo.bar.MySpringBootApplication\r\n\r\nDrawback of that solution ? Any changes in the pom.xml means re-creates the whole layer that download and stores the maven dependencies.\r\nThat is generally not acceptable for applications with many dependencies (and Spring Boot pulls many dependencies), overall if you don&#39;t use a maven repository manager during the image build.                                                                                                                                                                            \r\n\r\n**b) A more efficient way with cache for maven dependencies downloaded**   \r\n\r\nThe approach is here the same but maven dependencies downloads that are cached in the docker builder cache.   \r\nThe cache operation relies on buildkit (experimental api of docker).    \r\nTo enable buildkit, the env variable DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 has to be set (you can do that where you want : .bashrc, command line, docker daemon json file...).  \r\n\r\nDockerfile : \r\n\r\n    # syntax=docker/dockerfile:experimental\r\n\r\n    ########Maven build stage########\r\n    FROM maven:3.6-jdk-11 as maven_build\r\n    WORKDIR /app\r\n    \r\n    #copy pom\r\n    COPY pom.xml .\r\n        \r\n    #copy source\r\n    COPY src ./src\r\n    \r\n    # build the app and download dependencies only when these are new (thanks to the cache)\r\n    RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.m2  mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip\r\n\r\n    # split the built app into multiple layers to improve layer rebuild\r\n    RUN mkdir -p target/docker-packaging &amp;&amp; cd target/docker-packaging &amp;&amp; jar -xf ../my-app*.jar\r\n    \r\n    ########JRE run stage########\r\n    FROM openjdk:11.0-jre\r\n    WORKDIR /app\r\n    \r\n    #copy built app layer by layer\r\n    ARG DOCKER_PACKAGING_DIR=/app/target/docker-packaging\r\n    COPY --from=maven_build ${DOCKER_PACKAGING_DIR}/BOOT-INF/lib /app/lib\r\n    COPY --from=maven_build ${DOCKER_PACKAGING_DIR}/BOOT-INF/classes /app/classes\r\n    COPY --from=maven_build ${DOCKER_PACKAGING_DIR}/META-INF /app/META-INF\r\n    \r\n    #run the app\r\n    CMD java -cp .:classes:lib/* \\\r\n             -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom \\\r\n             foo.bar.MySpringBootApplication\r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                            \r\n                                                                           \r\n                                                                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://%20https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/create-a-java-web-application-using-embedded-tomcat\r\n","title":"How to dockerize maven project? and how many ways to accomplish it?","body":"<p>Here is my contribution.<br />\nI will not try to list all tools/libraries/plugins that exist to take advantage of Docker with Maven.

Any changes in the pom.xml means re-creates the whole layer that download and stores the maven dependencies.\nThat is generally not acceptable for applications with many dependencies (and Spring Boot pulls many dependencies), overall if you don't use a maven repository manager during the image build.</p>\n<p><strong>b) A more efficient way with cache for maven dependencies downloaded</strong></p>\n<p>The approach is here the same but maven dependencies downloads that are cached in the docker builder cache.<br />\nThe cache operation relies on buildkit (experimental api of docker).<br />\nTo enable buildkit, the env variable DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 has to be set (you can do that where you want : .bashrc, command line, docker daemon json file...).</p>\n<p>Dockerfile :</p>\n<pre><code># syntax=docker/dockerfile:experimental\n\n########Maven build stage########\nFROM maven:3.6-jdk-11 as maven_build\nWORKDIR /app\n\n#copy pom\nCOPY pom.xml .\n    \n#copy source\nCOPY src ./src\n\n# build the app and download dependencies only when these are new (thanks to the cache)\nRUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.m2  mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip\n\n# split the built app into multiple layers to improve layer rebuild\nRUN mkdir -p target/docker-packaging &amp;&amp; cd target/docker-packaging &amp;&amp; jar -xf ../my-app*.jar\n\n########JRE run stage########\nFROM openjdk:11.0-jre\nWORKDIR /app\n\n#copy built app layer by layer\nARG DOCKER_PACKAGING_DIR=/app/target/docker-packaging\nCOPY --from=maven_build ${DOCKER_PACKAGING_DIR}/BOOT-INF/lib /app/lib\nCOPY --from=maven_build ${DOCKER_PACKAGING_DIR}/BOOT-INF/classes /app/classes\nCOPY --from=maven_build ${DOCKER_PACKAGING_DIR}/META-INF /app/META-INF\n\n#run the app\nCMD java -cp .:classes:lib/* \\\n         -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom \\\n         foo.bar.MySpringBootApplication\n\n                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n</code></pre>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":16851476,"reputation":1571,"user_id":12184371,"display_name":"GBra 4.669"},"score":3,"creation_date":1611250573,"post_id":65831895,"comment_id":116397080,"body_markdown":"Hi, welcome to SO, would you mind adding some comments to your answer (e.g. a bit of description of what the code does)?

Findbugs will ignore it (on members). Sad, but true (https://sourceforge.net/p/findbugs/bugs/1181)\r\n- For static checking outside an IDE, 2 free tools exist: Spotbugs(formerly Findbugs) and checkersframework.\r\n- The Eclipse library has @NonNullByDefault, jsr305 only has @ParametersAreNonnullByDefault. Those are mere convenience wrappers applying base annotations to everything in a package (or class), you can easily create your own. This can be used on package. This may conflict with generated code (e.g. lombok).\r\n- Using lombok as an exported dependency should be avoided for libraries that you share with other people, the less transitive dependencies, the better\r\n- Using Bean validation framework is powerful, but requires high overhead, so that&#39;s overkill just to avoid manual null checking.\r\n- Using Optional for fields and method parameters is controversial (you can find articles about it easily)\r\n- Android null annotations are part of the Android support library, they come with a whole lot of other classes, and don&#39;t play nicely with other annotations/tools\r\n\r\nBefore Java9, this is my recommendation:\r\n\r\n    // file: package-info.java\r\n    @javax.annotation.ParametersAreNonnullByDefault\r\n    package example;\r\n\r\n\r\n    // file: PublicApi\r\n    package example;\r\n\r\n    public interface PublicApi {\r\n\r\n        Person createPerson(\r\n            // NonNull by default due to package-info.java above\r\n            String firstname,\r\n            String lastname);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // file: PublicApiImpl\r\n    public class PublicApiImpl implements PublicApi {\r\n        public Person createPerson(\r\n                // In Impl, handle cases where library users still pass null\r\n                @Nullable String firstname, // Users  might send null\r\n                @Nullable String lastname // Users might send null\r\n                ) {\r\n            if (firstname == null) throw new IllagalArgumentException(...);\r\n            if (lastname == null) throw new IllagalArgumentException(...);\r\n            return doCreatePerson(fistname, lastname, nickname);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @NonNull // Spotbugs checks that method cannot return null\r\n        private Person doCreatePerson(\r\n                 String firstname, // Spotbugs checks null cannot be passed, because package has ParametersAreNonnullByDefault\r\n                 String lastname,\r\n                 @Nullable String nickname // tell Spotbugs null is ok\r\n                 ) {\r\n             return new Person(firstname, lastname, nickname);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @CheckForNull // Do not use @Nullable here, Spotbugs will ignore it, though IDEs respect it\r\n        private Person getNickname(\r\n             String firstname,\r\n             String lastname) {\r\n             return NICKNAMES.get(firstname + &#39;:&#39; + lastname);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote that there is no way to make Spotbugs raise a warning when a nullable method parameter is dereferenced (at the time of writing, version 3.1 of Spotbugs). Maybe checkerframework can do that.\r\n\r\nSadly these annotations do not distinguish between the cases of a public method of a library with arbitrary callsites, and non-public methods where each callsite can be known. So the double meaning of: &quot;Indicate that null is undesired, but prepare for null being passed nevertheless&quot; is not possible in a single declaration, hence the above example has different annotations for the interface and the implementation.\r\n\r\nFor cases where the split interface approach is not practical, the following approach is a compromise:\r\n```\r\n        public Person createPerson(\r\n                @NonNull String firstname,\r\n                @NonNull String lastname\r\n                ) {\r\n            // even though parameters annotated as NonNull, library clients might call with null.\r\n            if (firstname == null) throw new IllagalArgumentException(...);\r\n            if (lastname == null) throw new IllagalArgumentException(...);\r\n            return doCreatePerson(fistname, lastname, nickname);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nThis helps clients to not pass null (writing correct code), while returning useful errors if they do.","title":"Which @NotNull Java annotation should I use?","body":"<p>Distinguish between static analysis and runtime analysis.

This may conflict with generated code (e.g. lombok).</li>\n<li>Using lombok as an exported dependency should be avoided for libraries that you share with other people, the less transitive dependencies, the better</li>\n<li>Using Bean validation framework is powerful, but requires high overhead, so that's overkill just to avoid manual null checking.</li>\n<li>Using Optional for fields and method parameters is controversial (you can find articles about it easily)</li>\n<li>Android null annotations are part of the Android support library, they come with a whole lot of other classes, and don't play nicely with other annotations/tools</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Before Java9, this is my recommendation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// file: package-info.java\n@javax.annotation.ParametersAreNonnullByDefault\npackage example;\n\n\n// file: PublicApi\npackage example;\n\npublic interface PublicApi {\n\n    Person createPerson(\n        // NonNull by default due to package-info.java above\n        String firstname,\n        String lastname);\n}\n\n// file: PublicApiImpl\npublic class PublicApiImpl implements PublicApi {\n    public Person createPerson(\n            // In Impl, handle cases where library users still pass null\n            @Nullable String firstname, // Users  might send null\n            @Nullable String lastname // Users might send null\n            ) {\n        if (firstname == null) throw new IllagalArgumentException(...);\n        if (lastname == null) throw new IllagalArgumentException(...);\n        return doCreatePerson(fistname, lastname, nickname);\n    }\n\n    @NonNull // Spotbugs checks that method cannot return null\n    private Person doCreatePerson(\n             String firstname, // Spotbugs checks null cannot be passed, because package has ParametersAreNonnullByDefault\n             String lastname,\n             @Nullable String nickname // tell Spotbugs null is ok\n             ) {\n         return new Person(firstname, lastname, nickname);\n    }\n\n    @CheckForNull // Do not use @Nullable here, Spotbugs will ignore it, though IDEs respect it\n    private Person getNickname(\n         String firstname,\n         String lastname) {\n         return NICKNAMES.get(firstname + ':' + lastname);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that there is no way to make Spotbugs raise a warning when a nullable method parameter is dereferenced (at the time of writing, version 3.1 of Spotbugs). Maybe checkerframework can do that.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly these annotations do not distinguish between the cases of a public method of a library with arbitrary callsites, and non-public methods where each callsite can be known. So the double meaning of: \"Indicate that null is undesired, but prepare for null being passed nevertheless\" is not possible in a single declaration, hence the above example has different annotations for the interface and the implementation.</p>\n\n<p>For cases where the split interface approach is not practical, the following approach is a compromise:</p>\n\n<pre><code>        public Person createPerson(\n                @NonNull String firstname,\n                @NonNull String lastname\n                ) {\n            // even though parameters annotated as NonNull, library clients might call with null.\n            if (firstname == null) throw new IllagalArgumentException(...);\n            if (lastname == null) throw new IllagalArgumentException(...);\n            return doCreatePerson(fistname, lastname, nickname);\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This helps clients to not pass null (writing correct code), while returning useful errors if they do.</p>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1293255,"reputation":7542,"user_id":1244932,"accept_rate":70,"display_name":"user1244932"},"score":1,"creation_date":1488540673,"post_id":42072129,"comment_id":72288096,"body_markdown":"I tried your advice, but `idea` tell nothing about `void test(@NonNull String s) {}` called by `test(null);`","body":"I tried your advice, but <code>idea</code> tell nothing about <code>void test(@NonNull String s) {}</code> called by <code>test(null);</code>"},{"owner":{"account_id":6803779,"reputation":711,"user_id":5236247,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Adowrath"},"score":3,"creation_date":1490289820,"post_id":42072129,"comment_id":73057884,"body_markdown":"@user1244932 Do you mean IntelliJ IDEA?

All we can do is to find a pragmatic solution and mine is as follows:\r\n\r\nSyntax\r\n------\r\n\r\nFrom a purely stylistic standpoint I would like to avoid any reference to IDE, framework or any toolkit except Java itself.\r\n\r\nThis rules out:\r\n\r\n - `android.support.annotation`\r\n - `edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations`\r\n - `org.eclipse.jdt.annotation`\r\n - `org.jetbrains.annotations`\r\n - `org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.qual`\r\n - `lombok.NonNull`\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich leaves us with either `javax.validation.constraints` or `javax.annotation`.\r\nThe former comes with JEE. If this is better than `javax.annotation`, which  might come eventually with JSE or never at all, is a matter of debate.\r\nI personally prefer `javax.annotation` because I wouldn&#39;t like the JEE dependency.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with\r\n\r\n**`javax.annotation`**\r\n\r\nwhich is also the shortest one.\r\n\r\nThere is only one syntax which would even be better: `java.annotation.Nullable`.

It will queue up more than one task at a time (potentially unbounded) but will never execute tasks concurrently.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sample Test (Kotlin/JUnit):</p>\n\n<pre><code>class LearningSchedulerTest {\n\n    private lateinit var pool: ScheduledExecutorService\n\n    @Before\n    fun before() {\n      pool = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2)\n    }\n\n    @After\n    fun after() {\n      pool.shutdown()\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24033208/how-to-prevent-overlapping-schedules-in-spring\n     *\n     * The documentation claims: If any execution of this task takes longer than its period, then subsequent executions may start late, but will not concurrently execute.\n     * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.html#scheduleAtFixedRate-java.lang.Runnable-long-long-java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit-\n     */\n\n    @Test\n    fun `scheduleAtFixedRate schedules at fixed rate`() {\n      val task = TaskFixture( initialSleep = 0)\n\n      pool.scheduleAtFixedRate({task.run()}, 0, 10, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS )\n\n      Thread.sleep(15)\n      Assert.assertEquals(2, task.invocations.get())\n\n      Thread.sleep(10)\n      Assert.assertEquals(3, task.invocations.get())\n\n      Thread.sleep(10)\n      // 1 initial and 3 periodic invocations\n      Assert.assertEquals(4, task.invocations.get())\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    fun `scheduleAtFixedRate catches up on late invocations`() {\n      val task = TaskFixture(initialSleep = 30)\n\n      pool.scheduleAtFixedRate({task.run()}, 0, 10, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS )\n\n      Thread.sleep(15) // we see no concurrent invocations\n      Assert.assertEquals(1, task.invocations.get())\n\n      Thread.sleep(10) // still no concurrent invocations\n      Assert.assertEquals(1, task.invocations.get())\n\n      Thread.sleep(10)\n\n      // 1 initial and 3 periodic invocations\n      Assert.assertEquals(4, task.invocations.get())\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    fun `scheduleWithFixedDelay schedules periodically`() {\n      val task = TaskFixture( initialSleep = 0)\n\n      pool.scheduleWithFixedDelay({task.run()}, 0, 10, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS )\n\n      Thread.sleep(35)\n\n      // 1 initial and 3 periodic invocations\n      Assert.assertEquals(4, task.invocations.get())\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    fun `scheduleWithFixedDelay does not catch up on late invocations`() {\n      val task = TaskFixture( initialSleep = 30)\n\n      pool.scheduleWithFixedDelay({task.run()}, 0, 10, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS )\n\n      Thread.sleep(35)\n\n      // 1 initial invocation, no time to wait the specified 10ms for a second invocation\n      Assert.assertEquals(1, task.invocations.get())\n    }\n\n    class TaskFixture(val initialSleep: Long) {\n      var invocations = AtomicInteger()\n\n      fun run() {\n        invocations.incrementAndGet()\n        if (invocations.get() == 1){\n          Thread.sleep(initialSleep)\n        }\n      }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":7545914,"reputation":135,"user_id":5728971,"display_name":"bashar"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1585581437,"creation_date":1585581437,"answer_id":60933736,"question_id":38842507,"body_markdown":"**The fixedDelay property makes sure that there is a delay of n millisecond between the finish time of an execution of a task and the start time of the next execution of the task.**\r\n\r\nThis property is specifically useful when we need to make sure that only one instance of the task runs all the time.

For e.g, the operation is getAllUsers which has a call to get from the DB, the span list shows the DB span id at the top as opposed to getAllUsers.</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance</p>\n<p>SG</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","testing","testng"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":14222505,"reputation":1873,"user_id":10275943,"display_name":"Ikbel"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1697098470,"creation_date":1697098470,"answer_id":77278840,"question_id":77274437,"body_markdown":"First, we&#39;ll need to use the broader IAnnotationTransformer interface, which allows transformation of several TestNG annotations including @Test, @BeforeTest, etc.\r\n\r\nModify the transformer to handle @BeforeTest, @AfterTest etc:\r\n\r\n    import org.testng.IAnnotationTransformer;\r\n    import org.testng.annotations.ITestAnnotation;\r\n    import org.testng.annotations.IConfigurationAnnotation;\r\n    \r\n    public class ExcludeFromReportTransformer implements IAnnotationTransformer {\r\n    \r\n        private static boolean isaBoolean(Method testMethod) {\r\n            return testMethod != null &amp;&amp;

As you can see, they are absolutely identical aside from the class name:</p>\n<hr />\n<pre><code>public class TestFileSL {\n  public TestFileSL();\n    Code:\n       0: aload_0\n       1: invokespecial #1                  // Method java/lang/Object.&quot;&lt;init&gt;&quot;:()V\n       4: return\n\n  public static void main(java.lang.String[]);\n    Code:\n       0: invokestatic  #7                  // Method java/lang/Math.random:()D\n       3: d2i\n       4: istore_1\n       5: invokestatic  #7                  // Method java/lang/Math.random:()D\n       8: d2i\n       9: istore_2\n      10: iload_1\n      11: iload_2\n      12: iadd\n      13: istore_3\n      14: getstatic     #13                 // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;\n      17: iload_3\n      18: invokedynamic #19,  0             // InvokeDynamic #0:makeConcatWithConstants:(I)Ljava/lang/String;\n      23: invokevirtual #23                 // Method java/io/PrintStream.print:(Ljava/lang/String;)V\n      26: return\n}\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<pre><code>public class TestFileML {\n  public TestFileML();\n    Code:\n       0: aload_0\n       1: invokespecial #1                  // Method java/lang/Object.&quot;&lt;init&gt;&quot;:()V\n       4: return\n\n  public static void main(java.lang.String[]);\n    Code:\n       0: invokestatic  #7                  // Method java/lang/Math.random:()D\n       3: d2i\n       4: istore_1\n       5: invokestatic  #7                  // Method java/lang/Math.random:()D\n       8: d2i\n       9: istore_2\n      10: iload_1\n      11: iload_2\n      12: iadd\n      13: istore_3\n      14: getstatic     #13                 // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;\n      17: iload_3\n      18: invokedynamic #19,  0             // InvokeDynamic #0:makeConcatWithConstants:(I)Ljava/lang/String;\n      23: invokevirtual #23                 // Method java/io/PrintStream.print:(Ljava/lang/String;)V\n      26: return\n}\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<p>As a side note, if you code is using the static method <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#random--\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Math.random()</code></a> of the <code>java.lang.Math</code> package, this method returns a random <code>double</code> between 0 and 1.

It allows net communication between applications using the socket without blocking the processes. But Teo, what is a non-blocking socket?, in which contexts can it be useful?, and how does it work? Okay young Padawan, let&#39;s answer these questions.\r\n\r\n## What is a non-blocking socket?\r\n\r\nA non-blocking socket allows I/O operations on a channel without blocking the processes using it. This means, we can use a single thread to handle multiple concurrent connections and gain *&quot;asynchronous high-performance&quot;* read/write operations (some people may not agreed with that).\r\n\r\nOk, **in which contexts can it be useful?**\r\n\r\nSuppose you would like to implement a server accepting diverse client connections. Suppose, as well, that you would like the server to be able to process multiple requests simultaneously. Using the traditional way you have two choices to develop such a server:\r\n\r\n a. Implement a multi-threaded server that manually handles a thread for each connection.\r\n b. Using an external third-party module.\r\n\r\nBoth solutions work, but adopting the first one you have to develop the whole thread-management solution, with related concurrency and conflict troubles. The second solution makes the application dependent on a non-JDK external module and probably you have to adapt the library to your necessities. By means of the non-blocking socket, you can implement a non-blocking server without directly managing threads or resorting to external modules.\r\n\r\n## How it works?\r\nBefore going into details, there are few terms that you need to understand:\r\n\r\n - In NIO based implementations, instead of writing data onto output streams and reading data from input streams, we read and write data from *buffers*. A *buffer* can be defined as a temporary storage. \r\n - *Channel* transports bulk of data into and out of *buffers*. Also, it can be viewed as an endpoint for communication.\r\n - *Readiness Selection* is a concept that refers to *“the ability to choose a socket that will not block when data is read or written.”*\r\n\r\nJava NIO has a class called `Selector` that allows a single thread to examine I/O events on multiple channels. How is this possible? Well, the `selector` can check the *&quot;readiness&quot;* of a channel for events such as a client attempting a connection, or a read/write operation. This is, each instance of `Selector` can monitor more **socket channels** and thus more connections. Now, when something happens on the channel (an event occurs), the `selector` informs the application to process **the request**. The `selector` does it by creating **event keys** (or selection keys), which are instances of the `SelectionKey` class. Each `key` holds information about **who is making the request** and **what type of the request is**, as shown in the Figure 1.\r\n\r\n[![Figure 1: Structure diagram][1]][1] *Figure 1: Structure diagram*\r\n\r\n## A basic implementation\r\n\r\nA server implementation consists of an infinite loop in which the `selector` waits for events and creates the event keys. There are four possible types for a key:\r\n\r\n - Acceptable: the associated client requests a connection.\r\n - Connectable: the server accepted the connection.\r\n - Readable: the server can read.\r\n - Writeable: the server can write.\r\n\r\nUsually `acceptable` keys are created on the server side. In fact, this kind of key simply informs the server that a client required a connection, then the server individuates the socket channel and associates this to the selector for read/write operations. After this, when the accepted client reads or writes something, the selector will create `readable` or `writeable` keys for that client..\r\n\r\nNow you are ready to write the server in Java, following the proposed algorithm. The creation of the socket channel, the `selector`, and the socket-selector registration can be made in this way:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfinal String HOSTNAME = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;\r\nfinal int PORT = 8511;\r\n\r\n// This is how you open a ServerSocketChannel\r\nserverChannel = ServerSocketChannel.open();\r\n// You MUST configure as non-blocking or else you cannot register the serverChannel to the Selector.\r\nserverChannel.configureBlocking(false);\r\n// bind to the address that you will use to Serve.\r\nserverChannel.socket().bind(new InetSocketAddress(HOSTNAME, PORT));\r\n\r\n// This is how you open a Selector\r\nselector = Selector.open();\r\n/*\r\n* Here you are registering the serverSocketChannel to accept connection, thus the OP_ACCEPT.\r\n* This means that you just told your selector that this channel will be used to accept connections.\r\n* We can change this operation later to read/write, more on this later.\r\n*/\r\nserverChannel.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst we create an instance of `SocketChannel` with `ServerSocketChannel.open()` method. Next, `configureBlocking(false)` invocation sets this `channel` **as nonblocking**. The connection to the server is made by `serverChannel.socket().bind()` method. The `HOSTNAME` represents the IP address of the server, and `PORT` is the communication port. Finally, invoke `Selector.open()` method to create a `selector` instance and register it to the `channel` and registration type. In this example, the registration type is `OP_ACCEPT`, which means the selector merely reports that a client attempts a connection to the server. Other possible options are: `OP_CONNECT`, which will be used by the client; `OP_READ`; and `OP_WRITE`.\r\n\r\nNow we need to handle this requests using an infinite loop. A simple way is the following:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Run the server as long as the thread is not interrupted.\r\nwhile (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {\r\n    /*\r\n     * selector.select(TIMEOUT) is waiting for an OPERATION to be ready and is a blocking call.\r\n     * For example, if a client connects right this second, then it will break from the select()\r\n     * call and run the code below it. The TIMEOUT is not needed, but its just so it doesn&#39;t\r\n     * block undefinable.\r\n     */\r\n    selector.select(TIMEOUT);\r\n\r\n    /*\r\n     * If we are here, it is because an operation happened (or the TIMEOUT expired).\r\n     * We need to get the SelectionKeys from the selector to see what operations are available.\r\n     * We use an iterator for this.\r\n     */\r\n    Iterator&lt;SelectionKey&gt; keys = selector.selectedKeys().iterator();\r\n\r\n    while (keys.hasNext()) {\r\n        SelectionKey key = keys.next();\r\n        // remove the key so that we don&#39;t process this OPERATION again.\r\n        keys.remove();\r\n\r\n        // key could be invalid if for example, the client closed the connection.\r\n        if (!key.isValid()) {\r\n            continue;\r\n        }\r\n        /*\r\n         * In the server, we start by listening to the OP_ACCEPT when we register with the Selector.\r\n         * If the key from the keyset is Acceptable, then we must get ready to accept the client\r\n         * connection and do something with it. Go read the comments in the accept method.\r\n         */\r\n        if (key.isAcceptable()) {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Accepting connection&quot;);\r\n            accept(key);\r\n        }\r\n        /*\r\n         * If you already read the comments in the accept() method, then you know we changed\r\n         * the OPERATION to OP_WRITE. This means that one of these keys in the iterator will return\r\n         * a channel that is writable (key.isWritable()). The write() method will explain further.\r\n         */\r\n        if (key.isWritable()) {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Writing...&quot;);\r\n            write(key);\r\n        }\r\n        /*\r\n         * If you already read the comments in the write method then you understand that we registered\r\n         * the OPERATION OP_READ. That means that on the next Selector.select(), there is probably a key\r\n         * that is ready to read (key.isReadable()). The read() method will explain further.\r\n         */\r\n        if (key.isReadable()) {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Reading connection&quot;);\r\n            read(key);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can find [the implementation source here][2]\r\n\r\n### NOTE: Asynchronous Server \r\n\r\nAn alternative to the the Non-blocking implementation we can deploy an Asynchronous Server. For instance, you can use the `AsynchronousServerSocketChannel` class, which provides an asynchronous channel for stream-oriented listening sockets. \r\n\r\nTo use it, first execute its static `open()` method and then `bind()` it to a specific **port**. Next, you&#39;ll execute its `accept()` method, passing to it a class that implements the `CompletionHandler` interface. Most often, you&#39;ll find that handler created as an *anonymous inner class*.\r\n\r\nFrom this `AsynchronousServerSocketChannel` object, you invoke `accept()` to tell it to start listening for connections, passing to it a custom `CompletionHandler` instance. When we invoke `accept()`, it returns immediately. Note that this is different from the traditional blocking approach; whereas the `accept()` method **blocked until a client connected to it**, the `AsynchronousServerSocketChannel` `accept()` method handles it for you.\r\n\r\nHere you have an example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class NioSocketServer\r\n{\r\n    public NioSocketServer()\r\n    {\r\n        try {\r\n            // Create an AsynchronousServerSocketChannel that will listen on port 5000\r\n            final AsynchronousServerSocketChannel listener = AsynchronousServerSocketChannel\r\n                    .open()\r\n                    .bind(new InetSocketAddress(5000));\r\n\r\n            // Listen for a new request\r\n            listener.accept(null, new CompletionHandler&lt;AsynchronousSocketChannel, Void&gt;()\r\n            {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public void completed(AsynchronousSocketChannel ch, Void att)\r\n                {\r\n                    // Accept the next connection\r\n                    listener.accept(null, this);\r\n\r\n                    // Greet the client\r\n                    ch.write(ByteBuffer.wrap(&quot;Hello, I am Echo Server 2020, let&#39;s have an engaging conversation!\\n&quot;.getBytes()));\r\n\r\n                    // Allocate a byte buffer (4K) to read from the client\r\n                    ByteBuffer byteBuffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(4096);\r\n                    try {\r\n                        // Read the first line\r\n                        int bytesRead = ch.read(byteBuffer).get(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\r\n\r\n                        boolean running = true;\r\n                        while (bytesRead != -1 &amp;&amp;

It allows net communication between applications using the socket without blocking the processes. But Teo, what is a non-blocking socket?, in which contexts can it be useful?, and how does it work? Okay young Padawan, let's answer these questions.</p>\n<h2>What is a non-blocking socket?</h2>\n<p>A non-blocking socket allows I/O operations on a channel without blocking the processes using it. This means, we can use a single thread to handle multiple concurrent connections and gain <em>&quot;asynchronous high-performance&quot;</em> read/write operations (some people may not agreed with that).</p>\n<p>Ok, <strong>in which contexts can it be useful?</strong></p>\n<p>Suppose you would like to implement a server accepting diverse client connections. Suppose, as well, that you would like the server to be able to process multiple requests simultaneously. Using the traditional way you have two choices to develop such a server:</p>\n<p>a. Implement a multi-threaded server that manually handles a thread for each connection.\nb. Using an external third-party module.</p>\n<p>Both solutions work, but adopting the first one you have to develop the whole thread-management solution, with related concurrency and conflict troubles. The second solution makes the application dependent on a non-JDK external module and probably you have to adapt the library to your necessities. By means of the non-blocking socket, you can implement a non-blocking server without directly managing threads or resorting to external modules.</p>\n<h2>How it works?</h2>\n<p>Before going into details, there are few terms that you need to understand:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In NIO based implementations, instead of writing data onto output streams and reading data from input streams, we read and write data from <em>buffers</em>. A <em>buffer</em> can be defined as a temporary storage.</li>\n<li><em>Channel</em> transports bulk of data into and out of <em>buffers</em>. Also, it can be viewed as an endpoint for communication.</li>\n<li><em>Readiness Selection</em> is a concept that refers to <em>“the ability to choose a socket that will not block when data is read or written.”</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Java NIO has a class called <code>Selector</code> that allows a single thread to examine I/O events on multiple channels. How is this possible? Well, the <code>selector</code> can check the <em>&quot;readiness&quot;</em> of a channel for events such as a client attempting a connection, or a read/write operation. This is, each instance of <code>Selector</code> can monitor more <strong>socket channels</strong> and thus more connections. Now, when something happens on the channel (an event occurs), the <code>selector</code> informs the application to process <strong>the request</strong>. The <code>selector</code> does it by creating <strong>event keys</strong> (or selection keys), which are instances of the <code>SelectionKey</code> class. Each <code>key</code> holds information about <strong>who is making the request</strong> and <strong>what type of the request is</strong>, as shown in the Figure 1.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UGsCh.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UGsCh.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: Structure diagram\" /></a> <em>Figure 1: Structure diagram</em></p>\n<h2>A basic implementation</h2>\n<p>A server implementation consists of an infinite loop in which the <code>selector</code> waits for events and creates the event keys. There are four possible types for a key:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acceptable: the associated client requests a connection.</li>\n<li>Connectable: the server accepted the connection.</li>\n<li>Readable: the server can read.</li>\n<li>Writeable: the server can write.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Usually <code>acceptable</code> keys are created on the server side. In fact, this kind of key simply informs the server that a client required a connection, then the server individuates the socket channel and associates this to the selector for read/write operations. After this, when the accepted client reads or writes something, the selector will create <code>readable</code> or <code>writeable</code> keys for that client..</p>\n<p>Now you are ready to write the server in Java, following the proposed algorithm. The creation of the socket channel, the <code>selector</code>, and the socket-selector registration can be made in this way:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>final String HOSTNAME = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;\nfinal int PORT = 8511;\n\n// This is how you open a ServerSocketChannel\nserverChannel = ServerSocketChannel.open();\n// You MUST configure as non-blocking or else you cannot register the serverChannel to the Selector.\nserverChannel.configureBlocking(false);\n// bind to the address that you will use to Serve.\nserverChannel.socket().bind(new InetSocketAddress(HOSTNAME, PORT));\n\n// This is how you open a Selector\nselector = Selector.open();\n/*\n* Here you are registering the serverSocketChannel to accept connection, thus the OP_ACCEPT.\n* This means that you just told your selector that this channel will be used to accept connections.\n* We can change this operation later to read/write, more on this later.\n*/\nserverChannel.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_ACCEPT);\n</code></pre>\n<p>First we create an instance of <code>SocketChannel</code> with <code>ServerSocketChannel.open()</code> method. Next, <code>configureBlocking(false)</code> invocation sets this <code>channel</code> <strong>as nonblocking</strong>. The connection to the server is made by <code>serverChannel.socket().bind()</code> method. The <code>HOSTNAME</code> represents the IP address of the server, and <code>PORT</code> is the communication port. Finally, invoke <code>Selector.open()</code> method to create a <code>selector</code> instance and register it to the <code>channel</code> and registration type. In this example, the registration type is <code>OP_ACCEPT</code>, which means the selector merely reports that a client attempts a connection to the server. Other possible options are: <code>OP_CONNECT</code>, which will be used by the client; <code>OP_READ</code>; and <code>OP_WRITE</code>.</p>\n<p>Now we need to handle this requests using an infinite loop. A simple way is the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>// Run the server as long as the thread is not interrupted.\nwhile (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {\n    /*\n     * selector.select(TIMEOUT) is waiting for an OPERATION to be ready and is a blocking call.\n     * For example, if a client connects right this second, then it will break from the select()\n     * call and run the code below it.

Besides, I did not want to have two/three separate places to set the <em>port</em> for the registry.</p>\n\n<p>Here's my code for the server alone, (hopefully) doing things I've described:</p>\n\n<pre><code>package server;\n\nimport interf.TicTacToeBoard;\n\nimport java.rmi.AlreadyBoundException;\nimport java.rmi.RemoteException;\nimport java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;\nimport java.rmi.registry.Registry;\nimport java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;\n\npublic class TicTacToeServer\n{\n    private static Registry registry;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args)\n        throws RemoteException, AlreadyBoundException\n    {\n        System.out.println(\"Server is up!\");\n\n        System.setProperty(\"java.security.policy\", \"file:/&lt;policy_file_path&gt;\");\n\n        if (System.getSecurityManager() == null)\n            System.setSecurityManager(new SecurityManager());\n\n        TicTacToeBoardImpl arena = new TicTacToeBoardImpl();\n        TicTacToeBoard stub =\n            (TicTacToeBoard) UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject(arena, 0);\n\n        registry = LocateRegistry.createRegistry(TicTacToeBoard.RMI_PORT);\n        registry.bind(TicTacToeBoard.RMI_NAME, stub);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Waiting for connections.\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This thing isn't complete; but in terms of being capable of serving a remote object, it should be. However, after printing that line with <code>\"Waiting for connections.\"</code>, the application just silently terminates.</p>\n\n<p>My only explanation to this is that the application gets garbage collected.</p>\n\n<p>It wouldn't get garbage collected in Oracle's example, because there, the RMIRegistry runs as a separate application from the server application, and RMIRegistry app holds a reference to the object residing inside the server app.</p>\n\n<p>It doesn't get garbage collected when my implementation <code>extends UnicastRemoteObject</code>, because... I don't know. All I know is that the application then keeps on running.</p>\n\n<p>Please correct me, if I have been wrong at any stage. On top of that, my question is, what are my options which does not involve running a RMIRegistry as a separate process and making my implementation extend the <code>UnicastRemoteObject</code>?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","spring-data-jpa","concurrency","spring-statemachine"],"owner":{"account_id":7200064,"reputation":1127,"user_id":5497548,"display_name":"Krutik"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1697092403,"creation_date":1697092403,"question_id":77278197,"body_markdown":"I have defined the SM like below in my codebase wherein OperationState Enum depicts the state for the StateMachine and the same property is part of the one of the hibernate Entity [OpInfo.java]\r\n\r\nBasically I have below 2 questions:\r\n\r\n1.As per my requirement, I need to persist the operation state to\r\n    OpInfo table whenever there is a state change.

Ideally it should.  The first parameter 'url' tells the <code>getConnection</code> method which driver should be used.\nStill, if only one DB connectivity is checked, and only one driver is kept, it works. As soon as 2 drivers are added and both are tried to be checked it fails with one of the two drivers. This seems wrong. This should work fine. But still, it doesn't.</p>\n<p>Ideally, the root cause of this should be found.  But if not, an alternative is to have small console applications. One for each DB.</p>\n<pre><code>java -cp ojdbc8.jar -jar oraclechecker.jar\n</code></pre>\n<p>and</p>\n<pre><code>java -cp sybase.jar -jar sybasechecker.jar\n</code></pre>\n<p>Those can be called and tested like this.  This will result in a separate JVM initialization - each with a different DB Driver and just ONE.</p>\n<p>The main webapp can use</p>\n<pre><code>Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(&quot;java&quot;, &quot;-cp&quot;, &quot;ojdbc8.jar&quot;, &quot;-jar&quot;, &quot;oraclechecker.jar&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Commands like this to call those as external commands.\nThe Web-App itself won't need to have any DB driver.</p>\n<p>This is just one of the possibilities...</p>\n<p>Check the following issue:\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14945289/how-to-use-multiple-jdbc-drivers-in-the-same-application\">How to use multiple JDBC drivers in the same application?</a></p>\n<p>It also says that 2 different DB drivers can work in parallel.  The first parameter <code>url</code> of <code>DriverManager.getConnection</code> will determine which driver to use.
