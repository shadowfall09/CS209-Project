I just ran the <code>NativeHookDemo</code> to see what it could possibly contribute beyond the facilities provided by JavaFX for listening for such events. ..."},{"owner":{"account_id":1327194,"reputation":1809,"user_id":1271785,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"pfurbacher"},"score":0,"creation_date":1677011744,"post_id":75525146,"comment_id":133252327,"body_markdown":"...

While updating I noticed that Hibernate 6 handles the conversion between java Instant fields to a table column without timezone information differently than Hibernate 5 does. \r\n\r\nIn Hibernate 6, when persisting an object with an instance field having value `2023-02-20T04:08:00Z`, the value is mapped to `2023-02-20T05:08:00Z` upon retrieval. As explained [here](https://thorben-janssen.com/hibernate-6-offsetdatetime-and-zoneddatetime/) this might be related to the new way of mapping Instant and Duration fields.\r\n\r\nI managed to fix this by adding `@JdbcType(InstantAsTimestampJdbcType.class)` to every `Instant` field in every `@Entity` class in the application. However, I would rather have a single, centralized configuration for this matter instead of adding annotations to each Instant field in the application. I have tried several approaches:\r\n\r\nOption 1: Adding the property `hibernate.timezone.default_storage` and tried out all the storage type options ([source](https://thorben-janssen.com/hibernate-6-offsetdatetime-and-zoneddatetime/#5_different_TimezoneStorageTypes)):\r\n\r\n```\r\nspring.jpa.properties.hibernate.timezone.default_storage=NORMALIZE_UTC\r\n```\r\n\r\nOption 2: Declaring a HibernatePropertiesCustomizer bean:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public HibernatePropertiesCustomizer hibernatePropertiesCustomizerPG() {\r\n\r\n        return hibernateProperties -&gt; {\r\n            hibernateProperties.put(EntityManagerFactoryBuilderImpl.TYPE_CONTRIBUTORS,\r\n                    (TypeContributorList) () -&gt; List.of(\r\n                            (TypeContributions typeContributions, ServiceRegistry serviceRegistry) -&gt;\r\n                                    typeContributions.contributeJdbcType(InstantAsTimestampJdbcType.INSTANCE)));\r\n        };\r\n    } \r\n```\r\n\r\nOption 3: Creating a `HibernatePropertiesCustomizer`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Configuration\r\npublic class HibernateTypeContributorConfiguration implements HibernatePropertiesCustomizer {\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void customize(Map&lt;String, Object&gt; hibernateProperties) {\r\n        hibernateProperties.put(\r\n                EntityManagerFactoryBuilderImpl.TYPE_CONTRIBUTORS,\r\n                (TypeContributorList) () -&gt; List.of((jdbcType, serviceRegistry) -&gt; jdbcType.contributeJdbcType(InstantAsTimestampJdbcType.INSTANCE))\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately none of the approaches have worked so far.

While updating I noticed that Hibernate 6 handles the conversion between java Instant fields to a table column without timezone information differently than Hibernate 5 does.</p>\n<p>In Hibernate 6, when persisting an object with an instance field having value <code>2023-02-20T04:08:00Z</code>, the value is mapped to <code>2023-02-20T05:08:00Z</code> upon retrieval. As explained <a href=\"https://thorben-janssen.com/hibernate-6-offsetdatetime-and-zoneddatetime/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> this might be related to the new way of mapping Instant and Duration fields.</p>\n<p>I managed to fix this by adding <code>@JdbcType(InstantAsTimestampJdbcType.class)</code> to every <code>Instant</code> field in every <code>@Entity</code> class in the application. However, I would rather have a single, centralized configuration for this matter instead of adding annotations to each Instant field in the application. I have tried several approaches:</p>\n<p>Option 1: Adding the property <code>hibernate.timezone.default_storage</code> and tried out all the storage type options (<a href=\"https://thorben-janssen.com/hibernate-6-offsetdatetime-and-zoneddatetime/#5_different_TimezoneStorageTypes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>):</p>\n<pre><code>spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.timezone.default_storage=NORMALIZE_UTC\n</code></pre>\n<p>Option 2: Declaring a HibernatePropertiesCustomizer bean:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>    @Bean\n    public HibernatePropertiesCustomizer hibernatePropertiesCustomizerPG() {\n\n        return hibernateProperties -&gt; {\n            hibernateProperties.put(EntityManagerFactoryBuilderImpl.TYPE_CONTRIBUTORS,\n                    (TypeContributorList) () -&gt; List.of(\n                            (TypeContributions typeContributions, ServiceRegistry serviceRegistry) -&gt;\n                                    typeContributions.contributeJdbcType(InstantAsTimestampJdbcType.INSTANCE)));\n        };\n    } \n</code></pre>\n<p>Option 3: Creating a <code>HibernatePropertiesCustomizer</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Configuration\npublic class HibernateTypeContributorConfiguration implements HibernatePropertiesCustomizer {\n\n    @Override\n    public void customize(Map&lt;String, Object&gt; hibernateProperties) {\n        hibernateProperties.put(\n                EntityManagerFactoryBuilderImpl.TYPE_CONTRIBUTORS,\n                (TypeContributorList) () -&gt; List.of((jdbcType, serviceRegistry) -&gt; jdbcType.contributeJdbcType(InstantAsTimestampJdbcType.INSTANCE))\n        );\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unfortunately none of the approaches have worked so far. Would anyone know how a <code>InstantAsTimestampJdbcType</code> can be registered? Or is there a better way to fix this?</p>\n<p><em>Note that modifying the table columns to add timezone information is not an option.</em></p>\n"},{"tags":["java","jvm","jvm-hotspot","adoptopenjdk"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":4210603,"reputation":94356,"user_id":3448419,"display_name":"apangin"},"score":0,"creation_date":1677018085,"post_id":75524995,"comment_id":133253873,"body_markdown":"It&#39;s not clear what you mean by &quot;two JVM implementations&quot;.

This turns into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a string array of length 3</li>\n<li>copy a into the first position.</li>\n<li>copy b into the second</li>\n<li>copy c into the third</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whereas most people believe that it will create a 2 character array with &quot;ab&quot;, and then throw it away when it creates a three character array with &quot;abc&quot;.  It actually understands that it's being chained and does some manipulation outside what you would assume if these were simple library calls.</p>\n<p><s>There is also a trick where if  you have the string &quot;abc&quot; and you ask for a substring that turns out to be &quot;bc&quot;, they CAN share the exact same underlying array.  You'll notice that there is a start position, end position and &quot;shared&quot; flag.</s></p>\n<p>In fact, if it's not shared, it's possible for it to extend the length of a string array and copy the new characters in when appending.</p>\n<p>Now I'm just being confusing.  Read the source code--it's fairly cool.</p>\n<p>Very Late Edit:\nThe part about sharing the underlying array isn't quite true any more.

can use the `Absolute Path` from IntelliJ IDEA. \r\n\r\nFor that simply follow the steps:\r\n\r\n1. Right click on the image from your IntelliJ IDEA directory. \r\n2. Click on `Copy Path/Reference...`\r\n\r\n[![Copy path/reference in IntelliJ IDEA][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Select the `Absolute Path`. Only clicking on that usually copies the link. But you can also `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `C` to copy the path. \r\n[![Select the absolute path from IntelliJ IDEA][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Now simply paste the absolute path to the `FXML` file in the image source.\r\n\r\n[![Use the absolute path in the FXML file][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Make sure to use an additional slash `\\` in the directory slashes as it needs to slash to specify that it is part of that address, not any escaping character.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that these procedures apply only when you have already copied the image file inside the project folder. If you want to use images located in a different directory, then you have to copy the absolute path. If you are using the Windows operating system, you can simply copy the absolute path by right clicking on the image file and going into the properties. The `Location` section contains the path. \r\n\r\nIf the `Location` does not contain the absolute path including the file name then you simply need to add the file name manually. \r\nFor example, check the image below.\r\n\r\n[![Properties of an image from Windows operating system][4]][4]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, in this file&#39;s properties tab, the file name is not included in the `Location` section. Therefore, I need to add the filename at the end of the location/path manually. \r\n\r\nIn this case, my absolute path would be `C:\\Users\\fahim\\Pictures\\Screenshots\\Screenshot_20230221_110058.png`.\r\n\r\nIf I want to use this path in the `FXML` file, I need to add one more slash there after each slash in the location. Then the path that I will include in my `FXML` file is this: `C:\\\\Users\\\\fahim\\\\Pictures\\\\Screenshots\\\\Screenshot_20230221_110058.png`.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you do not use any extra slashes ( `\\` ), that will also work perfectly!\r\n\r\nFor example, check the following code.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;image&gt;\r\n            &lt;Image url=&quot;C:\\Users\\fahim\\Desktop\\aoop-uiu\\SceneBuilder_01\\FirstApp\\src\\image\\background.jpg&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;/image&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did not use any extra slash ( `\\` ) in the absolute path now, but it still works like earlier.\r\n\r\n[![Absolute path without any extra slash][5]][5]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/jKovM.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/YH8hT.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/dgGf2.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/NasoA.png\r\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/rB7C7.png","title":"Background Image shows in SceneBuilder but not when App runs","body":"<p>You can use the <code>Absolute Path</code> from IntelliJ IDEA.</p>\n<p>For that simply follow the steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Right click on the image from your IntelliJ IDEA directory.</li>\n<li>Click on <code>Copy Path/Reference...</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jKovM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jKovM.png\" alt=\"Copy path/reference in IntelliJ IDEA\" /></a></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><p>Select the <code>Absolute Path</code>.

Then the path that I will include in my <code>FXML</code> file is this: <code>C:\\\\Users\\\\fahim\\\\Pictures\\\\Screenshots\\\\Screenshot_20230221_110058.png</code>.</p>\n<p>Also, if you do not use any extra slashes ( <code>\\</code> ), that will also work perfectly!</p>\n<p>For example, check the following code.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;image&gt;\n            &lt;Image url=&quot;C:\\Users\\fahim\\Desktop\\aoop-uiu\\SceneBuilder_01\\FirstApp\\src\\image\\background.jpg&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/image&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>I did not use any extra slash ( <code>\\</code> ) in the absolute path now, but it still works like earlier.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rB7C7.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rB7C7.png\" alt=\"Absolute path without any extra slash\" /></a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"display_name":"user5446333"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":2006,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":36415291,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1677000101,"creation_date":1459800232,"question_id":36411881,"body_markdown":"Already searched for an answer for this but the only similar question I could find was here (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11995958/javafx-background-image-works-in-scenebuilder-and-win-but-not-on-osx) and it hasn&#39;t been answered.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to get a background image to show when my App runs.
