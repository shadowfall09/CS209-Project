Is there an easier way to do this?</p>\n<p>So this is what I want the response to look like when a new user has been created successfully (which I have currently managed to get working successfully):</p>\n<pre><code>{\n    &quot;username&quot;: &quot;user&quot;,\n    &quot;password&quot;: &quot;password&quot;,\n    &quot;role&quot;: &quot;BUYER&quot;,\n    &quot;deposit&quot;: 0.0,\n    &quot;id&quot;: 12\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And if it fails, I want it to return something that looks along the lines of:</p>\n<pre><code>Error: username already in use.\n</code></pre>\n<p>or:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  &quot;error&quot; : &quot;Username already in use&quot;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>User object:</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity\n@Table(name = &quot;users&quot;)\npublic class User\n{\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n    @Column(name = &quot;id&quot;)\n    private int userId;\n\n    @NotNull\n    @Column(name = &quot;username&quot;, unique = true)\n    private String username;\n\n    @NotNull\n    @Column(name = &quot;password&quot;)\n    private String password;\n\n    @NotNull\n    @Column(name = &quot;role&quot;)\n    private Role role;\n\n    @NotNull\n    @Column(name = &quot;deposit&quot;)\n    private BigDecimal deposit;\n\n    public User() {}\n\n    public User(String username, String password, Role role, BigDecimal deposit)\n    {\n        this.username = username;\n        this.password = password;\n        this.role = role;\n        this.deposit = deposit;\n    }\n\n    public int getId()\n    {\n        return userId;\n    }\n\n    public String getUsername()\n    {\n        return username;\n    }\n\n    public void setUsername(String username)\n    {\n        this.username = username;\n    }\n\n    public String getPassword()\n    {\n        return password;\n    }\n\n    public void setPassword(String password)\n    {\n        this.password = password;\n    }\n\n    public Role getRole()\n    {\n        return role;\n    }\n\n    public void setRole(String role)\n    {\n        this.role = Role.valueOf(role);\n    }\n\n    public void setRole(Role role) {\n        this.role = role;\n    }\n\n    public BigDecimal getDeposit()\n    {\n        return deposit;\n    }\n\n    public void setDeposit(BigDecimal deposit)\n    {\n        this.deposit = deposit;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Method in the controller that is being called:</p>\n<pre><code>    @PostMapping(value = &quot;/create-user&quot;, consumes = {&quot;application/json&quot;})\n    public User createUser(@RequestBody User user)\n    {\n        return userService.createUser(user);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>createUser method in UserService:</p>\n<pre><code>    public User createUser(User user)\n    {\n//        if(userRepository.userExists(user.getUsername()) == 0)\n        return userRepository.save(user);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>UserRepository</code> is an interface that extends <code>JpaRepository</code>.</p>\n<p>If I have missed some information or have worded the question incorrectly, please let me know and I'll update accordingly.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","logging","log4j2"],"owner":{"account_id":2636141,"reputation":315,"user_id":2280760,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"Configueroa"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1674581773,"creation_date":1674577232,"question_id":75224325,"body_markdown":"In Log4j 2 properties we have had recently configured the daily roll - which was working great for the first few days.

Now, the problem is, When I try to run an individual test from IDE the classes with @Aspect annotation are not executing at all but when I use <code>mvn test</code> command it executes as expected. This behavior started when I updated the java version from 8 to 11 otherwise previously it was working fine no matter how I executed the test.

Also relevant: [`@RequestBody`][3] javadocs, [`@ResponseBody`][4] javadocs\r\n\r\nUsage examples would be something like this:\r\n\r\nUsing a JavaScript-library like JQuery, you would post a JSON-Object like this:\r\n\r\n    { &quot;firstName&quot; : &quot;Elmer&quot;, &quot;lastName&quot; : &quot;Fudd&quot; }\r\n\r\nYour controller method would look like this:\r\n\r\n    // controller\r\n    @ResponseBody @RequestMapping(&quot;/description&quot;)\r\n    public Description getDescription(@RequestBody UserStats stats){\r\n        return new Description(stats.getFirstName() + &quot; &quot; + stats.getLastname() + &quot; hates wacky wabbits&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // domain / value objects\r\n    public class UserStats{\r\n        private String firstName;\r\n        private String lastName;\r\n        // + getters, setters\r\n    }\r\n    public class Description{\r\n        private String description;\r\n        // + getters, setters, constructor\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow if you have [Jackson][5] on your classpath (and have an [`&lt;mvc:annotation-driven&gt;`][6] setup), Spring would convert the incoming JSON to a UserStats object from the post body (because you added the `@RequestBody` annotation) and it would serialize the returned object to JSON (because you added the `@ResponseBody` annotation). So the Browser / Client would see this JSON result:\r\n\r\n    { &quot;description&quot; : &quot;Elmer Fudd hates wacky wabbits&quot; }\r\n\r\nSee this previous answer of mine for a complete working example: https://stackoverflow.com/a/5908632/342852\r\n\r\nNote: RequestBody / ResponseBody is of course not limited to JSON, both can handle multiple formats, including plain text and XML, but JSON is probably the most used format.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n## Update\r\nEver since Spring 4.x, you usually won&#39;t use `@ResponseBody` on method level, but rather `@RestController` on class level, with the same effect.\r\n\r\nHere is a quote from the official [Spring MVC documentation][7]:\r\n\r\n&gt; `@RestController` is a [composed annotation][8] that is itself *meta-annotated*\r\n&gt; with `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody` to indicate a controller whose\r\n&gt; every method inherits the type-level `@ResponseBody` annotation and,\r\n&gt; therefore, writes directly to the response body versus view resolution\r\n&gt; and rendering with an HTML template.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-ann-requestbody\r\n  [2]: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-ann-responsebody\r\n  [3]: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/index.html?org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestBody.html\r\n  [4]: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/index.html?org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/ResponseBody.html\r\n  [5]: http://jackson.codehaus.org/\r\n  [6]: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-config-enable\r\n  [7]: https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-ann-controller\r\n  [8]: https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-meta-annotations","title":"@RequestBody and @ResponseBody annotations in Spring","body":"<p>There is a whole Section in the docs called <a href=\"http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-ann-requestbody\" rel=\"noreferrer\">16.3.3.4 Mapping the request body with the @RequestBody annotation</a>.

So the Browser / Client would see this JSON result:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{ \"description\" : \"Elmer Fudd hates wacky wabbits\" }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>See this previous answer of mine for a complete working example: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/5908632/342852\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/5908632/342852</a></p>\n\n<p>Note: RequestBody / ResponseBody is of course not limited to JSON, both can handle multiple formats, including plain text and XML, but JSON is probably the most used format.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Update</h2>\n\n<p>Ever since Spring 4.x, you usually won't use <code>@ResponseBody</code> on method level, but rather <code>@RestController</code> on class level, with the same effect.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a quote from the official <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-ann-controller\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Spring MVC documentation</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>@RestController</code> is a <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-meta-annotations\" rel=\"noreferrer\">composed annotation</a> that is itself <em>meta-annotated</em>\n  with <code>@Controller</code> and <code>@ResponseBody</code> to indicate a controller whose\n  every method inherits the type-level <code>@ResponseBody</code> annotation and,\n  therefore, writes directly to the response body versus view resolution\n  and rendering with an HTML template.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":5752727,"reputation":1642,"user_id":4541832,"display_name":"Maciej Lach"},"score":0,"creation_date":1444044900,"post_id":32947324,"comment_id":53719969,"body_markdown":"Please correct formatting of the answer and code sample.","body":"Please correct formatting of the answer and code sample."},{"owner":{"account_id":2483509,"reputation":1261,"user_id":2162470,"display_name":"Leonid Glanz"},"score":0,"creation_date":1444045622,"post_id":32947324,"comment_id":53720378,"body_markdown":"Please describe how this code helps the questioner.
