ROWS \r\n    FETCH NEXT ? ROWS ONLY\r\n\r\nOracle\r\n------\r\n\r\n    SELECT *\r\n    FROM (\r\n        SELECT \r\n            row_.*, rownum rownum_\r\n        FROM (\r\n            SELECT \r\n                p.id AS id1_0_,\r\n                p.created_on AS created_on2_0_,\r\n                p.title AS title3_0_\r\n            FROM post p\r\n            ORDER BY p.created_on\r\n        ) row_\r\n        WHERE rownum &lt;= ?\r\n    )\r\n    WHERE rownum_ &gt; ?\r\n\r\nThe advantage of using `setFirstResult` and `setMaxResults` is that Hibernate can generate the database-specific pagination syntax for any supported relational databases.\r\n\r\nAnd, you are not limited to JPQL queries only. You can use the `setFirstResult` and `setMaxResults` method seven for native SQL queries.\r\n\r\nNative SQL queries\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nYou don&#39;t have to hardcode the database-specific pagination when using native SQL queries. Hibernate can add that to your queries.\r\n\r\nSo, if you&#39;re executing this SQL query on PostgreSQL:\r\n\r\n    List&lt;Tuple&gt; posts = entityManager.createNativeQuery(\r\n    \tSELECT\r\n    \t   p.id AS id,\r\n    \t   p.title AS title\r\n    \tfrom post p\r\n    \tORDER BY p.created_on\r\n    \t&quot;&quot;&quot;, Tuple.class)\r\n    .setFirstResult(10)\r\n    .setMaxResults(10)\r\n    .getResultList();\r\n\r\nHibernate will transform it as follows:\r\n\r\n    SELECT p.id AS id,\r\n           p.title AS title\r\n    FROM post p\r\n    ORDER BY p.created_on\r\n    LIMIT ?\r\n    OFFSET ?\r\n\r\nCool, right?\r\n\r\nBeyond SQL-based pagination\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nPagination is good when you can index the filtering and sorting criteria. If your pagination requirements imply dynamic filtering, it&#39;s a much better approach to use an inverted-index solution, like ElasticSearch. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/IGtD2.png","title":"How do you do a limit query in JPQL or HQL?","body":"<h2>The <code>setFirstResult</code> and <code>setMaxResults</code> <code>Query</code> methods</h2>\n<p>For a JPA and Hibernate <code>Query</code>, the <code>setFirstResult</code> method is the equivalent of <code>OFFSET</code>, and the <code>setMaxResults</code> method is the equivalent of LIMIT:</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;Post&gt; posts = entityManager.createQuery(&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    select p\n    from Post p\n    order by p.createdOn\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;)\n.setFirstResult(10)\n.setMaxResults(10)\n.getResultList();\n</code></pre>\n<h2>The <code>LimitHandler</code> abstraction</h2>\n<p>The Hibernate <code>LimitHandler</code> defines the database-specific pagination logic, and as illustrated by the following diagram, Hibernate supports many database-specific pagination options:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IGtD2.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IGtD2.png\" alt=\"LimitHandler implementations\" /></a></p>\n<p>Now, depending on the underlying relational database system you are using, the above JPQL query will use the proper pagination syntax.</p>\n<h2>MySQL</h2>\n<pre><code>SELECT p.id AS id1_0_,\n       p.created_on AS created_2_0_,\n       p.title AS title3_0_\nFROM post p\nORDER BY p.created_on\nLIMIT ?, ?\n</code></pre>\n<h2>PostgreSQL</h2>\n<pre><code>SELECT p.id AS id1_0_,\n       p.created_on AS created_2_0_,\n       p.title AS title3_0_\nFROM post p\nORDER BY p.created_on\nLIMIT ?\nOFFSET ?\n</code></pre>\n<h2>SQL Server</h2>\n<pre><code>SELECT p.id AS id1_0_,\n       p.created_on AS created_on2_0_,\n       p.title AS title3_0_\nFROM post p\nORDER BY p.created_on\nOFFSET ?

Why is that? This happens because String class implements an equals() method, which checks that the values are the same. On the other hand, StringBuilder does not implement equals() method, instead it uses the implementation of equals() provided by `Object` class. And implementation provided(inherited) by `Object` class does only simply checks if the two referred objects are the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo to check if two objects are equivalent Java uses the `equals()` method and whenever you introduce your own type you must overrides `equals()` method if you do not want to rely on `Object` class implementation of `equals()` method \r\n\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s for example introduce our own type : simple class Apple\r\n\r\n    public class Apple  {\r\n    \r\n    \tprivate int weight;\r\n    \tprivate int cost;\r\n        private String color;\r\n\r\nNow how do would you decide if two apples are equal? By color, by weight, by price or something else? This is why you need to supply explicitly your own equals method, so objects of your type can be compared for equality.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample below compares two `Apple` object for equality, and says that two object are equal if they belong to the same &#39;Apple&#39; class and if their weight and cost is the same. Notice we do not compare by color, we assume that color is irrelevant in our case, which means that we accept the fact that apples of different colors, but with the same weight and same cost are considered equals. \r\n\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n    \tpublic boolean equals(Object obj) {\r\n            if ( !(obj instanceof Apple)) return false;    \r\n    \t\tif (obj == null)\r\n    \t\t\treturn false;\r\n    \t\tif (getClass() != obj.getClass())\r\n    \t\t\treturn false;\r\n    \t\tApple other = (Apple) obj;\r\n    \t\tif (cost != other.cost and weight != other.weight )\r\n    \t\t\treturn false;\r\n    \t\treturn true;\r\n    \t}\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can implement any logic you like for your `equals()` method. Java `equals()` method is very important and it provides contract or important rules developer shall follow. I will not list them, you get them from [here][1], they are logic and pretty straight forward.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another contract of `equals()` - whenever you override `equals()`, you are also expected to override `hashCode()` method. The reason behind that is because hashcode is used internally by some of Java collections, when object is stored as a key in the map. \r\n\r\nHashcode is a number that categorizes object into categories. Imagine you are given various sorts of apples(red, green, yellow) and asked to give them back when asked for particular sort. It would be much efficient and faster if you categorize them, put each in a different buckets accordingly and whenever asked for particular sort (for simplicity let&#39;s say red apple), and as you have already sorted and categorized them, you can retrieve them much faster. Hope it is clear now why do you need to implement `hashcode()`. `hashcode()` has it&#39;s own contract or rules same as `equals()` method. They pretty much make common sense :\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, result of `hashcode()` within same program shall not change. What it means that in your `hascode()` calculations you should not include variable that my change during execution of a program. For example if cost of Apple&#39;s is mutable, i.e. it may change, it is not good idea to include them into hashcode() calculation, otherwise results would be inconsistent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond rule says, that when called with two objects, if `equals()` returns true then  calling `hashCode()` on each of those objects must retrieve the same result. But if `equals()` returns false when called with two objects, calling `hashCode()` on each of those objects does not necessary have to return a different result. Confusing? Why? Because `hashCode()` results are not required to be unique when called on unequal objects - you may put two unequal object in one bucket.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow regarding `Comparator` - it is easier to understand it&#39;s logic when you introduce your own type, instead of using built-in types.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example let&#39;s say we have class `Apple` with two attributes : `weight` and `price` and want to put out object this type into sorted collection `TreeSet`.\r\n\r\n    public class Apple  {\r\n    \r\n    \tprivate int weight;\r\n    \tprivate int cost;\r\n\r\n\r\nNow how do you want this apples to be sorted inside collection - do you want to sort them by `weight` or by `price`? How shall compiler decide?\r\n\r\nSupplying appropriate `Comparator`or `Comparable` allows you to pass your intent.\r\nLet&#39;s try to add object to collection.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n      public class Apple {\r\n        \r\n        private int weight;\r\n        private int cost;\r\n\t\r\n\t  public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\t\tApple redApple = new Apple();\r\n\t\tredApple.setCost(10);\r\n\t\tredApple.setWeight(2);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tApple greenApple = new Apple();\r\n\t\tgreenApple.setCost(12);\r\n\t\tgreenApple.setWeight(3);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSet&lt;Apple&gt; apples = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;();\r\n\t\tapples.add(redApple);\r\n\t\tapples.add(greenApple);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(apples);\r\n\t   } \r\n\r\n\t    public int getWeight() {\r\n\t\t   return weight;\r\n\t    }\r\n\r\n\t   public void setWeight(int weight) {\r\n\t\t   this.weight = weight;\r\n\t    }\r\n\r\n\t   public int getCost() {\r\n\t\t   return cost;\r\n\t   }\r\n\r\n       public void setCost(int cost) {\r\n\t\t this.cost = cost;\r\n\t    }\r\n\r\n\t   @Override\r\n\t   public String toString() {\r\n\t\t   return &quot;Apple [weight=&quot; + weight + &quot;, cost=&quot; + cost + &quot;]&quot;;\r\n\t    }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf you run above code you will get RuntimeError : `Apple cannot be cast to java.lang.Comparable`, because compiler has to way to figure out how do you want to compare your apples. \r\nSo let&#39;s fix it :\r\n  Let&#39;s implement `Comparable` interface\r\n \r\n\r\n      public class Apple implements Comparable&lt;Apple&gt; {\r\n\r\nand override `compareTo` method\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n     @Override\r\n    \tpublic int compareTo(Object obj) {\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tint cost = ((Apple) obj).getCost();\r\n    \t\treturn this.getCost() - cost; // sorting in ascending order.\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\t// change to this to sort in Descending order\r\n            // return cost - this.getCost();\r\n    \t}\r\n\r\nNow with this changes, let&#39;s run our code :\r\n\r\n    [Apple [weight=2, cost=10], Apple [weight=3, cost=12]]\r\n    \r\n\r\n Our collection is sorted by cost in ascending order.\r\n\r\nNow what if you don&#39;t have access to `Apple` class and you can&#39;t change source code to implement `Comparable`.\r\n\r\nThis is where `Comparator` helps. \r\n\r\nRemove `implements Comparable`, as we assume we can&#39;t modify this class\r\n\r\n    public class Apple {\r\n    \r\nand remove method\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public String toString() {\r\n    \treturn &quot;Apple [weight=&quot; + weight + &quot;, cost=&quot; + cost + &quot;]&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAdd comparator implementation :\r\n  \r\n\r\n      public class AppleComparator implements Comparator&lt;Apple&gt; {\r\n        \r\n        \t@Override\r\n        \tpublic int compare(Apple app1, Apple app2) {\r\n        \t\treturn app1.getCost() - app2.getCost();\r\n        \t}\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow I can just supply `Comparator` to collection to express my intend\r\n\r\n\tSet&lt;Apple&gt; apples = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;(new AppleComparator());\r\n    \r\nCollection again will be sorted by cost, accordingly to supplied Comparator.\r\nSo we need to supply either `Comparator` or `Comparable` in order to get them stored in the collection, particularly in `TreeSet`.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow regarding your question : There is no connection between `Comparator` and `equals()` method . There is only required consistency between `Comparable` (compareTo() method ) and `equals()` method.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample - in above mentioned `Apple` class, in version that implements Comparable, \r\nwe introduce new logic for determining equality. The `compareTo()` method returns 0 if two objects are equal, while your `equals()` method returns true if two objects are equal.\r\n\r\n\r\nA natural ordering that uses `compareTo()` required to be consistent with equals iff x.equals(y) is true whenever x.compareTo(y) equals 0. So you have to make your `Comparable` class consistent with equals because some Java collection classes may behave unpredictably if the `compareTo()` and `equals()` methods are not returning consistent results. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe following example shows compareTo() method that is not consistent with equals:\r\n\r\n    public class Apple implements Comparable&lt;Apple&gt; { \r\n    \r\n    private int weight;\r\n    private int cost;\r\n    private String color;\r\n    \r\n    public boolean equals(Object obj) {\r\n       if(!(obj instanceof Apple)) { \r\n          return false;\r\n      }\r\n       Apple other = (Apple) obj; \r\n        return this.weight == other.weight;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n    public int compareTo(Apple obj) {\r\n        return this.cost.compareTo(obj.cost); }\r\n     }\r\n\r\nIf we want to sort Apple objects by cost, but cost may not be unique. There could two objects with the same cost. Therefore, the return value of `compareTo()` might not be 0 when comparing two equal `Apple` objects, which mean that this `compareTo()` method is not consistent with `equals()`. \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals(java.lang.Object)\r\n\r\n","title":"Comparator : Equals method functionality","body":"<p><code>equals()</code> method of the class, <code>Comparator</code> and <code>Comparator</code> require equals consistency because some Java collection classes may behave unpredictably if the <code>compareTo()</code> and <code>equals()</code> methods are not returning consistent results.</p>\n\n<p>Java uses == operator to compare two primitives and/or to check if two variables refer to the same object. \nExample :</p>\n\n<pre><code>String apple1 = new String(\"apple\");\nString apple2 = new String(\"apple\"); \nSystem.out.println(apple1.equals(apple2)); // true\n\nStringBuilder app1 = new StringBuilder(\"apple\"); \nStringBuilder app2 = new StringBuilder(\"apple\"); \nSystem.out.println(app1.equals(app2));   // false\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see we get different behavior. Why is that? This happens because String class implements an equals() method, which checks that the values are the same. On the other hand, StringBuilder does not implement equals() method, instead it uses the implementation of equals() provided by <code>Object</code> class. And implementation provided(inherited) by <code>Object</code> class does only simply checks if the two referred objects are the same.</p>\n\n<p>So to check if two objects are equivalent Java uses the <code>equals()</code> method and whenever you introduce your own type you must overrides <code>equals()</code> method if you do not want to rely on <code>Object</code> class implementation of <code>equals()</code> method </p>\n\n<p>Let's for example introduce our own type : simple class Apple</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Apple  {\n\n    private int weight;\n    private int cost;\n    private String color;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now how do would you decide if two apples are equal? By color, by weight, by price or something else? This is why you need to supply explicitly your own equals method, so objects of your type can be compared for equality.</p>\n\n<p>Example below compares two <code>Apple</code> object for equality, and says that two object are equal if they belong to the same 'Apple' class and if their weight and cost is the same. Notice we do not compare by color, we assume that color is irrelevant in our case, which means that we accept the fact that apples of different colors, but with the same weight and same cost are considered equals. </p>\n\n<pre><code>    @Override\n    public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n        if ( !(obj instanceof Apple)) return false;    \n        if (obj == null)\n            return false;\n        if (getClass() != obj.getClass())\n            return false;\n        Apple other = (Apple) obj;\n        if (cost != other.cost and weight != other.weight )\n            return false;\n        return true;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can implement any logic you like for your <code>equals()</code> method. Java <code>equals()</code> method is very important and it provides contract or important rules developer shall follow. I will not list them, you get them from <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals(java.lang.Object)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, they are logic and pretty straight forward.</p>\n\n<p>There is another contract of <code>equals()</code> - whenever you override <code>equals()</code>, you are also expected to override <code>hashCode()</code> method. The reason behind that is because hashcode is used internally by some of Java collections, when object is stored as a key in the map. </p>\n\n<p>Hashcode is a number that categorizes object into categories. Imagine you are given various sorts of apples(red, green, yellow) and asked to give them back when asked for particular sort. It would be much efficient and faster if you categorize them, put each in a different buckets accordingly and whenever asked for particular sort (for simplicity let's say red apple), and as you have already sorted and categorized them, you can retrieve them much faster. Hope it is clear now why do you need to implement <code>hashcode()</code>. <code>hashcode()</code> has it's own contract or rules same as <code>equals()</code> method. They pretty much make common sense :</p>\n\n<p>First, result of <code>hashcode()</code> within same program shall not change. What it means that in your <code>hascode()</code> calculations you should not include variable that my change during execution of a program. For example if cost of Apple's is mutable, i.e. it may change, it is not good idea to include them into hashcode() calculation, otherwise results would be inconsistent.</p>\n\n<p>Second rule says, that when called with two objects, if <code>equals()</code> returns true then  calling <code>hashCode()</code> on each of those objects must retrieve the same result. But if <code>equals()</code> returns false when called with two objects, calling <code>hashCode()</code> on each of those objects does not necessary have to return a different result. Confusing? Why? Because <code>hashCode()</code> results are not required to be unique when called on unequal objects - you may put two unequal object in one bucket.</p>\n\n<p>Now regarding <code>Comparator</code> - it is easier to understand it's logic when you introduce your own type, instead of using built-in types.</p>\n\n<p>For example let's say we have class <code>Apple</code> with two attributes : <code>weight</code> and <code>price</code> and want to put out object this type into sorted collection <code>TreeSet</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Apple  {\n\n    private int weight;\n    private int cost;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now how do you want this apples to be sorted inside collection - do you want to sort them by <code>weight</code> or by <code>price</code>? How shall compiler decide?</p>\n\n<p>Supplying appropriate <code>Comparator</code>or <code>Comparable</code> allows you to pass your intent.\nLet's try to add object to collection.</p>\n\n<pre><code>  public class Apple {\n\n    private int weight;\n    private int cost;\n\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    Apple redApple = new Apple();\n    redApple.setCost(10);\n    redApple.setWeight(2);\n\n    Apple greenApple = new Apple();\n    greenApple.setCost(12);\n    greenApple.setWeight(3);\n\n    Set&lt;Apple&gt; apples = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;();\n    apples.add(redApple);\n    apples.add(greenApple);\n\n    System.out.println(apples);\n   } \n\n    public int getWeight() {\n       return weight;\n    }\n\n   public void setWeight(int weight) {\n       this.weight = weight;\n    }\n\n   public int getCost() {\n       return cost;\n   }\n\n   public void setCost(int cost) {\n     this.cost = cost;\n    }\n\n   @Override\n   public String toString() {\n       return \"Apple [weight=\" + weight + \", cost=\" + cost + \"]\";\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you run above code you will get RuntimeError : <code>Apple cannot be cast to java.lang.Comparable</code>, because compiler has to way to figure out how do you want to compare your apples. \nSo let's fix it :\n  Let's implement <code>Comparable</code> interface</p>\n\n<pre><code>  public class Apple implements Comparable&lt;Apple&gt; {\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and override <code>compareTo</code> method</p>\n\n<pre><code> @Override\n    public int compareTo(Object obj) {\n\n        int cost = ((Apple) obj).getCost();\n        return this.getCost() - cost; // sorting in ascending order.\n\n        // change to this to sort in Descending order\n        // return cost - this.getCost();\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now with this changes, let's run our code :</p>\n\n<pre><code>[Apple [weight=2, cost=10], Apple [weight=3, cost=12]]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Our collection is sorted by cost in ascending order.</p>\n\n<p>Now what if you don't have access to <code>Apple</code> class and you can't change source code to implement <code>Comparable</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This is where <code>Comparator</code> helps. </p>\n\n<p>Remove <code>implements Comparable</code>, as we assume we can't modify this class</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Apple {\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and remove method</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Override\npublic String toString() {\n    return \"Apple [weight=\" + weight + \", cost=\" + cost + \"]\";\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Add comparator implementation :</p>\n\n<pre><code>  public class AppleComparator implements Comparator&lt;Apple&gt; {\n\n        @Override\n        public int compare(Apple app1, Apple app2) {\n            return app1.getCost() - app2.getCost();\n        }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I can just supply <code>Comparator</code> to collection to express my intend</p>\n\n<pre><code>Set&lt;Apple&gt; apples = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;(new AppleComparator());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Collection again will be sorted by cost, accordingly to supplied Comparator.\nSo we need to supply either <code>Comparator</code> or <code>Comparable</code> in order to get them stored in the collection, particularly in <code>TreeSet</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now regarding your question : There is no connection between <code>Comparator</code> and <code>equals()</code> method .

That&#39;s where the `interfaces` like `Comparable` and `Comparator` have their significance.\r\n\r\nAdd this code to your `Person` class\r\n\r\n    public int compareTo(Person other) {\r\n\t\tDouble person1Salary = this.getSalary();\r\n\t\tDouble person2Salary = other.getSalary();\r\n\t    return person1Salary.compareTo(person2Salary);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nby making your class Comparable type like `Person implements Comparable&lt;Person&gt;`\r\n\r\nSo by this code you are explaining the collection on which attribute we need to do the sorting. So when you print the content of `Set` it will be ordered on the base salary (ascending by default).\r\n\r\nThe Wrapper classes like `Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double` and other predefied classes like `String` all are implementing `Comaparable` interface and that&#39;s why you can simply pass them to a Sortable collection.\r\n\r\nNow coming to `equals` method, it is used to check the equality of two objects, the traditional `equals` method inherited from Object class will check equality based on address locations. So take a case in Person class where I haven&#39;t overrided `equals` method and I&#39;m writing a code like this\r\n\r\n    Person p1 = new Person(1, &quot;Sam&quot;, &quot;M-1-SAM-50&quot;, 50000.00);\r\n    Person p2 = new Person(1, &quot;Sam&quot;, &quot;M-1-SAM-50&quot;, 50000.00);\r\n    System.out.println(p1.equals(p2));\r\n\r\nIt will return false because both are two different objects placed in two different address locations, but we know that the objects are having data of the same person. That&#39;s the place where we override `equals()` method like I did in my `Person` class based on `Person code`. In that case `System.out.println(p1.equals(p2));` will print true because the codes are equal. `equals()` method helps us in finding the duplicates. I hope this helps.","title":"Comparator : Equals method functionality","body":"<p>I don't understand why you are linking the <code>Comparator</code> and the <code>equals()</code> method.

Here is an example</p>\n\n<pre><code>package snippet;\n\nimport java.util.Iterator;\nimport java.util.Set;\nimport java.util.TreeSet;\n\nclass Person {\n\n    private int id;\n    private String name;\n    private String code;\n    private double salary;\n    public int getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n    public void setId(int id) {\n        this.id = id;\n    }\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n    public void setName(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n    public String getCode() {\n        return code;\n    }\n    public void setCode(String code) {\n        this.code = code;\n    }\n    public double getSalary() {\n        return salary;\n    }\n    public void setSalary(double salary) {\n        this.salary = salary;\n    }\n    public boolean equals(Object obj) {         \n        if(obj != null &amp;&amp; (obj instanceof Person)) {\n            Person other = (Person) obj;\n            return this.code.equals(other.getCode());\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n    public Person(int id, String name, String code, double salary) {\n        super();\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.code = code;\n        this.salary = salary;\n    }\n}\n\npublic class EqualsMethodImpl\n{\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Set&lt;Person&gt; set = new TreeSet&lt;Person&gt;();\n        Person p1 = new Person(1, \"Sam\", \"M-1-SAM-50\", 50000.00);\n        Person p2 = new Person(2, \"Diaz\", \"M-1-SAM-35\", 35000.00);\n        Person p3 = new Person(3, \"Remy\", \"M-1-SAM-100\", 100000.00);\n        Person p4 = new Person(4, \"Cesar\", \"M-1-SAM-80\", 80000.00);\n        Person p5 = new Person(5, \"Rino\", \"M-1-SAM-5\", 5000.00);\n\n        set.add(p1);\n        set.add(p2);\n        set.add(p3);\n        set.add(p4);\n        set.add(p5);\n\n        printPersons(set);\n    }\n\n    private static void printPersons(Set&lt;Person&gt; set) {\n        System.out.println(\"Id\\tName\\tCode\\t\\tSalary\");\n        Iterator&lt;Person&gt; perItr = set.iterator();       \n        while(perItr.hasNext()) {\n            Person p = perItr.next();\n            System.out.println(p.getId()+\"\\t\"+p.getName()+\"\\t\"+p.getCode()+\"\\t\"+p.getSalary());\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While you running this code you will get <code>ClasCastException</code> at line <code>set.add(p1);</code>, why because the collection <code>TreeSet</code> is confused about on which attribute of <code>Peron</code> class should it do the sorting. That's where the <code>interfaces</code> like <code>Comparable</code> and <code>Comparator</code> have their significance.</p>\n\n<p>Add this code to your <code>Person</code> class</p>\n\n<pre><code>public int compareTo(Person other) {\n    Double person1Salary = this.getSalary();\n    Double person2Salary = other.getSalary();\n    return person1Salary.compareTo(person2Salary);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>by making your class Comparable type like <code>Person implements Comparable&lt;Person&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>So by this code you are explaining the collection on which attribute we need to do the sorting. So when you print the content of <code>Set</code> it will be ordered on the base salary (ascending by default).</p>\n\n<p>The Wrapper classes like <code>Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double</code> and other predefied classes like <code>String</code> all are implementing <code>Comaparable</code> interface and that's why you can simply pass them to a Sortable collection.</p>\n\n<p>Now coming to <code>equals</code> method, it is used to check the equality of two objects, the traditional <code>equals</code> method inherited from Object class will check equality based on address locations. So take a case in Person class where I haven't overrided <code>equals</code> method and I'm writing a code like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>Person p1 = new Person(1, \"Sam\", \"M-1-SAM-50\", 50000.00);\nPerson p2 = new Person(1, \"Sam\", \"M-1-SAM-50\", 50000.00);\nSystem.out.println(p1.equals(p2));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It will return false because both are two different objects placed in two different address locations, but we know that the objects are having data of the same person. That's the place where we override <code>equals()</code> method like I did in my <code>Person</code> class based on <code>Person code</code>. In that case <code>System.out.println(p1.equals(p2));</code> will print true because the codes are equal. <code>equals()</code> method helps us in finding the duplicates. I hope this helps.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":11390544,"reputation":234,"user_id":8376357,"display_name":"Stingy"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1501433631,"creation_date":1501433187,"answer_id":45402281,"question_id":45397657,"body_markdown":"First of all, *please* use generics.

Your class `MyComparator` implements the raw type `Comparator`, which means that by just looking at its type declaration, you have no way of knowing which types of objects it compares.

On the other hand, if it were to implement `Comparator&lt;Integer&gt;`, the compiler will never let it come to this, because then, the method signature of the `compare` method would read `compare(Integer, Integer)` instead of `compare(Object, Object)`, meaning that, if an object is not an `Integer`, it can never be passed to the method in the first place, which is something that can already be ensured *at compile time*.\r\n\r\nHaving that out of the way, you seem to be confusing `Comparator` and `Comparable`. A `Comparable` means that something has a &quot;natural ordering&quot;, as Java calls it.

He suggested making the `Person` class implement `Comparable&lt;Person&gt;` so that you can pass it to a `TreeSet&lt;Person&gt;`, but this seems counterintuitive to me, for the precise reason that a person is not inherently quantifiable. You might want to sort the persons by their salary, but this quantification is not inherent to a person, it is only specific to your particular intention in that situation.

In other words, if a comparison method (be that a `Comparator` or a natural ordering) deems two objects equal that are also equal according to their respective `equals(Object)` method, and vice versa, this comparison method is &quot;consistent with equals&quot; This has nothing to do with the `equals(Object)` method of a `Comparator`, which was already pointed out by Mike Nakis (unless you want to compare `Comparator`s).\r\n\r\nAn example of a natural ordering that is inconsistent with equals is that of the class `BigDecimal`.

The application receives many orders via MQ and it checks if the orders exists in the db or not. If it doesnt exist then after processing the order (business logic) it saves it to the db. Currently I am using a single thread to to handle these orders (read operation to check if already exist in db + business logic). Only when I want to save the order to the db (write operation) I hand off the task to another thread. So while the db is being checked to see if `Order n + 10` exists already, another thread might be saving `Order n` to the db. When I increase the incoming rate for the orders I notice that certain read operations take a very long amount of time. I am wondering what could be the reason for this ? Right now 2 threads are interacting with the db\r\n 1. thread 1 (read operation + business logic)\r\n 2. thread 2 (write operation)\r\n \r\nI have already created indexes.

The application receives many orders via MQ and it checks if the orders exists in the db or not. If it doesnt exist then after processing the order (business logic) it saves it to the db. Currently I am using a single thread to to handle these orders (read operation to check if already exist in db + business logic). Only when I want to save the order to the db (write operation) I hand off the task to another thread. So while the db is being checked to see if <code>Order n + 10</code> exists already, another thread might be saving <code>Order n</code> to the db. When I increase the incoming rate for the orders I notice that certain read operations take a very long amount of time. I am wondering what could be the reason for this ?

Its final stop is at the view implementation <strong>(6)</strong>, typically a JSP, where it delivers the model data. The request’s job is finally done. The view will use the model data to render output that will be carried back to the client by the (not- so-hardworking) response object <strong>(7)</strong>.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":15361989,"reputation":1,"user_id":11082547,"display_name":"anjali shrivas"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1550555622,"creation_date":1550555622,"answer_id":54759682,"question_id":2769467,"body_markdown":"Dispatcher Controller are displayed in the figure all the incoming request is in intercepted by the dispatcher servlet that works as front controller.\r\nThe dispatcher servlet gets an entry to handler mapping from the XML file and forwords the request to the Controller.","title":"What is Dispatcher Servlet in Spring?","body":"<p>Dispatcher Controller are displayed in the figure all the incoming request is in intercepted by the dispatcher servlet that works as front controller.\nThe dispatcher servlet gets an entry to handler mapping from the XML file and forwords the request to the Controller.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":6968985,"reputation":11,"user_id":5345979,"display_name":"kartik"},"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1554173137,"creation_date":1554173137,"answer_id":55466227,"question_id":2769467,"body_markdown":"    &lt;?xml version=&#39;1.0&#39;
