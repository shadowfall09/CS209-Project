You can use [`swagger-codegen-maven-plugin`][1] to generate a REST client. But before that , you need to describe the REST API in YAML or JSON in [`OpenAPI Specification`][2]  mainly because `swagger-codegen-maven-plugin` only can generate a REST client from a file written in this specification.\r\n\r\nOther answers assume that you need to write the specification manually while my solution take a step further to automatically generating the specification from the REST controller source codes. \r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;*The latest OpenAPI version is 3.0 .But based on the package of your imported swagger annotation , you are using version 2.0 (or before). So my solution assume you are using OpenAPI 2.0.*&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\n**Generating Open API Specification**\r\n\r\nFirst, you can use [swagger-maven-plugin][3] to generate an OpenAPI spec from the RestController source codes. It basically analyses the Swagger annotations annotated in the `@RestController` classes that specified in `&lt;locations&gt;` and dump the OpenAPI spec to `/src/main/resources/swagger.json` :\r\n\r\n    &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;groupId&gt;com.github.kongchen&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;artifactId&gt;swagger-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;version&gt;3.1.5&lt;/version&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;configuration&gt;\r\n    \t\t&lt;apiSources&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t&lt;apiSource&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t&lt;springmvc&gt;true&lt;/springmvc&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t&lt;locations&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t&lt;location&gt;com.dgs.spring.springbootswagger.controller.EmployeeController&lt;/location&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t&lt;location&gt;com.dgs.spring.springbootswagger.controller.FooController&lt;/location&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t&lt;/locations&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t&lt;schemes&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t&lt;scheme&gt;http&lt;/scheme&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t&lt;/schemes&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t&lt;host&gt;127.0.0.1:8080&lt;/host&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t&lt;basePath&gt;/&lt;/basePath&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t&lt;info&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t&lt;title&gt;My API&lt;/title&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t&lt;version&gt;1.1.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t&lt;/info&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t&lt;swaggerDirectory&gt;${basedir}/src/main/resources/&lt;/swaggerDirectory&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t&lt;/apiSource&gt;\r\n    \t\t&lt;/apiSources&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;executions&gt;\r\n    \t\t&lt;execution&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t&lt;goals&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t&lt;goal&gt;generate&lt;/goal&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t&lt;/goals&gt;\r\n    \t\t&lt;/execution&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;/executions&gt;\r\n    &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n\r\nExecute the followings  maven command to start generation: \r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn clean compile\r\n```\r\n**Generating Rest Client**\r\n\r\nAfter `swagger.json` is generated,  you can copy and paste it to your client project (e.g. /src/main/resources/swagger.json) . We can then use `swagger-codegen-maven-plugin` to generate a HTTP client . \r\n\r\nBy default , it will generate the [whole maven project][4] which includes test cases and other documentation stuff.

Testing Swagger 2.0 JSON API documentation\r\n\r\n   http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs?group=employee\r\n\r\n   http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs (if you haven&#39;t set a group named `employee`)\r\n\r\n2. Testing Swagger UI\r\n\r\n   http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html\r\n\r\n# Download Swagger Codegen Executable\r\nYou can download the [swagger-codegen-cli-2.4.7.jar][1] from the Maven Central Repository.\r\n\r\n# Generating Client Code\r\nNow that you have the Swagger Codegen JAR, you can generate the REST client by executing the following command:\r\n\r\n    java -jar swagger-codegen-cli-2.4.7.jar generate \\\r\n      -i http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs?group=employee \\\r\n      -l java \\\r\n      -o swagger-codegen-client\r\n\r\nif no swagger grouping,\r\n\r\n    java -jar swagger-codegen-cli-2.4.7.jar generate \\\r\n      -i http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs \\\r\n      -l java \\\r\n      -o swagger-codegen-client\r\n\r\n## Options\r\nThough Swagger Codegen CLI comes with a number of options, we&#39;re using the options which are absolutely necessary for \r\ngenerating the client code.\r\n\r\n* `-i` the URL pointing to your application&#39;s `Swagger api docs`.\r\n* `-l` the programming language of the client which in this case is `java`\r\n* `-o` the output folder for the generated client code.\r\n\r\nOnce you execute the previous command for generating the code, you should notice notice the following message on your terminal:\r\n\r\n    [main] INFO io.swagger.parser.Swagger20Parser - reading from http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs?group=employee\r\n    [main] WARN io.swagger.codegen.ignore.CodegenIgnoreProcessor - Output directory does not exist, or is inaccessible.

However the most important class is the [EmployeeControllerApi.java][4]. \r\nThis&#39;s the class which contains all the logic for making REST client classes.\r\n\r\nThe other important class is [EmployeeControllerApiTest.java][3]. It shows you how to use the [EmployeeControllerApi.java][4]. The generated client project also provides a [README][5] file which is very helpful.\r\n\r\n## URL Changes\r\nThe [ApiClient][6] class contains information related to establishing a HTTP client connection.

<code>finally</code> block can also throw a <code>NullPointerException</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Also note that you can declare <code>main</code> to throw <code>IOException</code> (then you would not need the outermost <code>try</code> statement.)</p>\n\n<p>There is little point in swallowing exceptions from <code>zipStream.close();</code>, because if it throws an exception you will not have a valid .gz file (so you should not proceed to write it.)</p>\n\n<p>Also I would not swallow exceptions from <code>byteStream.close();</code> but for a different reason - they should never be thrown (i.e. there is a bug in your JRE and you would want to know about that.)</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":5172978,"reputation":61,"user_id":4140964,"display_name":"Harikanth"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"is_accepted":false,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1413282536,"creation_date":1413281425,"answer_id":26358167,"question_id":14777800,"body_markdown":"If

Thanks to [Johannes Kuhn](https://stackoverflow.com/users/845414/johannes-kuhn) for his comment. \r\n\r\n* **JDK proxies (old answer):** _You can filter class names beginning with `$Proxy`, usually something like `com.sun.proxy.$Proxy2` (the trailing number being different). According to the [JDK documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/reflection/proxy.html): _&quot;The unqualified name of a proxy class is unspecified. The space of class names that begin with the string `&quot;$Proxy&quot;` is, however, to be reserved for proxy classes.&quot;_ At least for Oracle and probably OpenJDK, you can match for that naming pattern. If that holds true for all JVMs, is up to you to test, if chances are that in your environments others are being used. I quickly tried with Semeru OpenJ9, and the proxy naming pattern is identical, even the package name `com.sun.proxy`. Pleasae note that in more recent JDK versions, JDK proxies will have fully qualified names like `jdk.proxy2.$Proxy25`, so in e.g. Java 16 or 17 you should not rely on package name `com.sun.proxy`. Either add more cases or limit matching to the leading `$Proxy` in the simple class name._\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Update 2022-02-26:** Because there was activity on this question, I decided to add some more information about Spring-specific tools which can determine whether an object (or a class) is an AOP proxy (class) and, more specifically, if it is a CGLIB or JDK proxy:\r\n\r\nTake a look at tool class [`AopUtils`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/support/AopUtils.html) and its handy methods\r\n  * `isAopProxy(Object)`,\r\n  * `isCglibProxy(Object)`,\r\n  * `isJdkDynamicProxy(Object)`.\r\n\r\nNo more String matching, simply ask Spring.\r\n\r\nBTW, there is also a method `net.sf.cglib.proxy.Proxy.isProxyClass(Class)` directly in CGLIB, which is supposed to do the same, but within Spring it does not work, probably because Spring uses CGLIB in a non-canonical way. Because Spring embeds a package-relocated CGLIB in its core, the corresponding method `org.springframework.cglib.proxy.Proxy.isProxyClass(Class)` yields the same faulty result. So if you are working within Spring, please do not use those methods, better use `AopUtils`. \r\n\r\n[Here is some example code](https://github.com/kriegaex/SO_AJ_SpringJDKvsCGLIB_61382719/blob/354469d43c97f4e580971caf89bd46abcf96267e/src/main/java/de/scrum_master/spring/app/Application.java#L75-L86) for your convenience, showing how to determine Spring AOP proxy types (JDK vs. CGLIB proxies) using `AopUtils`.

environment to dynamically generate bytecode and the corresponding class is not included in the WebGoat&#39;s classpath originally, so `javassist.ClassPool.get(className)` is throwing the error.\r\n\r\nMy code for creating ClassPool object is as below.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString name = Descriptor.toJavaName(className);\r\n\r\n            try {\r\n                ClassPool cp =

tried to send a &quot;start istrumentation&quot; request with a specific id using Java Spark REST API, so whenever I send this request, it triggers `inst.addTransformer` method to create a new Transformer and adds it to the instrumentation object.\r\n\r\nWhat could be the cause of this error? I assume that WebGoat itself is using some instrumentation which means I am instrumenting an instrumented application and I don&#39;t know if that is even possible.\r\n\r\nAny insight would be much appreciated.","title":"Is it possible to instrument a program that also uses dynamic bytecode generation?","body":"<p>I am writing a Java instrumentation program that uses the built-in Instrumentation API with Javassist (v3.26.0-GA) to intercept all the method calls in the target program.

When you make a repository, you can stick your objects there by saving them in the repository. Notice that by extending the `CrudRepository` with correct generics, you don&#39;t even need to implement the methods yourself. The `save` method actually saves the POJO, and returns the saved version, which is why I did `user = userRepository.save(user)`, which may seem counterintuitive at first, but it simply helps ensure that everything is as you expect. If you then want to send the `UserDAO` object as a response, you can create it using the `user` object that is returned from the database, maybe something like: \r\n\r\n    UserDAO dao = new UserDAO(userRepository.save(user));\r\n\r\nPlease take notice of what is happening inside the `test` method in `MainController`. First, we create the POJO `User` object and set its fields. Then we have to save it to the repository, it is only persisted after you call `save` method of the repository. Please note that the `user` object is saved again once it is updated with the `address`.\r\n\r\nThis is a very crude way to do things, it is best to create a service layer and do this there with the `@Transactional` annotation, which would mean that everything is rolled back in case something goes wrong inside a method annotated as `@Transactional`. \r\n\r\nAlso, using `CascadeType.ALL` may be not what you want, please refer to this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13027444/17105581). \r\n\r\nInside `fetch` method, I ensure that the `user` indeed exists, which is not guaranteed. To avoid 500 errors, it&#39;s important to have a fallback mechanism for when something doesn&#39;t work. \r\n\r\nAs a final side note, you shouldn&#39;t be storing raw passwords like that, you should at least use hashing with salt and pepper, or use one of the many available libraries for implementing such functionality (although it can be quite fun getting down and dirty with the code itself). You should also consider how much information you are revealing when something does go wrong, as you don&#39;t want to give away too much information which could be used to deanonimise a specific user, or even learn more about your code and the system architecture.","title":"java.lang.StackOverflowError: null [Spring Boot, Hibernate]","body":"<p>TLDR: you aren't actually saving anything anywhere, but it's easy to fix.

Statement : &#39;***Let me explain a little. First I create a folder named &quot;target&quot; in the project root repository.***&#39; I assume that you are creating this by executing ```folder = new File(&quot;target&quot;);``` This actually will not create the directory, what you need to apply something like the following:\r\n```\r\nString directory = &quot;/target&quot;;\r\ndirectory.mkdir()\r\n```\r\nHowever, when this part of your code runs, this will not actually create the directory due to your docker-compose.yml where the volume mapping configuration from your chrome-node is mapped to the host ***/target*** directory.\r\n```\r\nvolumes:\r\n  ./target:/home/seluser/Downloads\r\n```\r\nThis will already exist, as docker will create it, so the java code will return a boolean value of &#39;false&#39; (as it does not need to create the directory) and will proceed to the next step.\r\n\r\n 2. **docker-compose.yml**: there is a mapping for your &#39;selenium/node-chrome&#39; image where you have mapped ***/target*** to ***/home/seluser/Downloads***. As this directory does not initially exist when &#39;***docker-compose up***&#39; is run, docker will create the directory on the host, so it can be mapped to your desired volume. Here lies 2 problems, first of all docker runs as root and will create the new &#39;***/target***&#39; directory on the host, but only gives it linux permissions &#39;***drwxr-xr-x***&#39; (755). This means that only root user can write to that directory.

This is the way the output looks:\r\n\r\nThis is the way the game starts. This part of the program works fine.A Dealer class executes the code below. When the result is a tie (card ranks are equal, in this case 4), the Dealer class invokes the warCall() method from the War2 class.

I also implemented the &quot;either only first names or both first and last names only&quot; feature.\r\n\r\nThe way I did that was to first take in user input for the first name. I created a boolean variable, ```firstOnly```, that stores if the names should either be first names or not. If the value of ```name1``` contains a space, then we set this to false, otherwise it is true.\r\n\r\nWhen we take user inputs for ```name2``` and ```name3```, if ```firstOnly``` is true, then we will keep asking for user inputs until their input contains no space. If ```firstOnly``` is false, then we will keep asking for user inputs until their input contains a space.\r\n\r\nMake sure that when you take in user input for the test scores, you type in ```input.nextLine()``` afterwards. This is because after you enter an ```int``` or ```double``` into user input, it will leave behind a trailing newline which will affect the following user input if it is a String.\r\n\r\nNext, we store the 3 names and 3 scores in lists: ```names```, ```scores```. Now, we need to sort the lists with respect to ```scores```. That is, we sort ```scores``` and shuffle ```names``` the same way so that the elements correspond to each other.\r\n\r\nTo sort ```scores``` we can use selection sort. I will quickly explain selection sort below:\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say we have an array, ```arr``` that has 4 elements. We find the minimum element from ```arr[0]``` to ```arr[3]```. After we find this minimum element, we swap it with ```arr[0]```. \r\n\r\nNext, we continue to find the minimum element from ```arr[1]``` to ```arr[3]``` and swap it with ```arr[1]```. We continue this process until we reach the end of our loops.\r\n\r\nThe key to this problem is to modify the &quot;swapping&quot; part of selection sort. By applying the same changes of ```scores``` to ```names``` the arrays elements will maintain the correspondence to each other prior to the sorting.\r\n\r\nHere is a kind of &quot;test&quot; that may help demonstrate:\r\n\r\n```names = {&quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Carrot&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;};```\r\n\r\n```scores = {50, 20, 40, 60};```\r\n\r\nWe set our swapping element to ```scores[0]```, ```50``` and find the minimum between ```{50,20,40,60}```, which is ```20```. We then switch ```50``` and ```20```, and thus we switch ```&quot;Apple&quot;``` and ```&quot;Banana&quot;```.\r\n\r\nNow we have:\r\n\r\n```names = {&quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Carrot&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;};```\r\n\r\n```scores = {20, 50, 40, 60};```\r\n\r\nWe set our swapping element to ```scores[1]```, ```50``` and find the minimum between ```{50,40,60}```, which is ```40```. We then switch ```50``` and ```40```, and thus we switch ```&quot;Apple&quot;``` and ```&quot;Carrot&quot;```.\r\n\r\n```names = {&quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Carrot&quot;, &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;};```\r\n\r\n```scores = {20, 40, 50, 60};```\r\n\r\nWe set our swapping element to ```scores[2]```, ```50``` and find the minimum between ```{50,60}```, which is ```50```. We then switch ```50``` and ```50```, and thus we switch ```&quot;Apple&quot;``` and ```&quot;Apple&quot;```, which has no change.\r\n\r\nThus, our final arrays are:\r\n\r\n```names = {&quot;Banana&quot;, &quot;Carrot&quot;, &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Date&quot;};```\r\n\r\n```scores = {20, 40, 50, 60};```\r\n\r\nNow we can print them out and they will be outputted from least to greatest (in our problem we can only have 3 names and 3 scores but it&#39;s the same idea).\r\n\r\nI hope this helped answer your question!

These files are read in and put into different arrays. One is an array of names. The other four are arrays with test scores.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the program does create the arrays correctly. Next the program is to calculate and display the average for each test (this works fine). Then the program prompts the user for a name. If a name is found a new menu will prompt the user to select which test they want the data on. (This works fine.)\r\n\r\nThe problem: I have the main program class and another `GradeBook` class (does calculations) on another page. How do I connect the two pages together?\r\n\r\nFor example: If the `foundStudent` is &#39;Andrew&#39; and it is found in `studentNameArray` and I select 1 for which test score, I want to see (`scoreOneArray`), say the number 88. My program finds &#39;Andrew&#39; and &#39;88&#39;. What it does not do is send &#39;Andrew&#39; and &#39;88&#39; to `GradeBook` to have the data compute test percentage (88/100) and find the corresponding letter grade (in this case &#39;B&#39;).

Generally *not* intended for use in the user-interface.\r\n\r\nFor enums, I would generally advise not overriding `toString`. \r\n\r\n## `getDisplayName`\r\n\r\nInstead, **add another method to the enum** class for the purpose of accessing a name meant for display in the user-interface.\r\n\r\nCommonly, such a method is called `getDisplayName`. For example, [`Month#getDisplayName`][3] and [`DayOfWeek#getDisplayName`][4].\r\n\r\nBy the way, an enum should generally be named in the singular.\r\n\r\nTip: Name your parameters descriptively. IDEs commonly display the parameter name in the code editor as a prompt. So `NickName( final String displayName )` rather than `NickName( final String s )`.\r\n\r\nHere is some untested example code.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic enum NickName\r\n\r\n{\r\n    JENNIFER( &quot;Jenny&quot; ) ,\r\n    MICHAEL( &quot;Mike&quot; ) ,\r\n    WILLIAM( &quot;Will&quot; ) ;\r\n\r\n    // Member fields.\r\n    private final String displayName;\r\n\r\n    // Constructors.\r\n    NickName( final String displayName ) {\r\n        // Verify argument.\r\n        Objects.requireNonNull( displayName ) ;  \r\n        if( displayName.isBlank() ) { throw new IllegalArgumentException() ; }\r\n        // Remember argument.\r\n        this.name = displayName ;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Accessors.\r\n    public String getDisplayName() {\r\n        return this.displayName ;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy the way, your `getNickNames` method is probably not necessary. In modern Java, the calling programmer could just as well write something like this untested code:\r\n\r\n    String[] nickNames = Arrays.stream( NickName.values() ).map( NickName :: getDisplayName ).toArray() ;\r\n\r\nIf you believe that to be too much for your particular calling programmers, I suggest changing your implementation of `getNickNames` to be that one-liner.

For example, <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Month.html#getDisplayName(java.time.format.TextStyle,java.util.Locale)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Month#getDisplayName</code></a> and <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/DayOfWeek.html#getDisplayName(java.time.format.TextStyle,java.util.Locale)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>DayOfWeek#getDisplayName</code></a>.</p>\n<p>By the way, an enum should generally be named in the singular.</p>\n<p>Tip: Name your parameters descriptively. IDEs commonly display the parameter name in the code editor as a prompt. So <code>NickName( final String displayName )</code> rather than <code>NickName( final String s )</code>.</p>\n<p>Here is some untested example code.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public enum NickName\n\n{\n    JENNIFER( &quot;Jenny&quot; ) ,\n    MICHAEL( &quot;Mike&quot; ) ,\n    WILLIAM( &quot;Will&quot; ) ;\n\n    // Member fields.\n    private final String displayName;\n\n    // Constructors.\n    NickName( final String displayName ) {\n        // Verify argument.\n        Objects.requireNonNull( displayName ) ;  \n        if( displayName.isBlank() ) { throw new IllegalArgumentException() ; }\n        // Remember argument.\n        this.name = displayName ;\n    }\n\n    // Accessors.\n    public String getDisplayName() {\n        return this.displayName ;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>By the way, your <code>getNickNames</code> method is probably not necessary. In modern Java, the calling programmer could just as well write something like this untested code:</p>\n<pre><code>String[] nickNames = Arrays.stream( NickName.values() ).map( NickName :: getDisplayName ).toArray() ;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you believe that to be too much for your particular calling programmers, I suggest changing your implementation of <code>getNickNames</code> to be that one-liner.
