And we also have a case when all digits are equal, i.e. the number is neither increasing, no decreasing, but it&#39;s considered to be a valid monotonic number (e.g. `111`).\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve come up with the following algorithm:\r\n\r\n* Maintain three `boolean` flags representing three cases when a number can be considered monotonic, described above. To initialize these flags, we need to access both the **first** and the **last** digits of the given number. Because adjacent digits can be equal, only comparison of the first and the last digits would provide sufficient information regarding expected ordering of the number. Here is how all three flags would be initialized:\r\n   * `isEqual = first == last;`\r\n   * `isIncreasing = first &gt;= last;`\r\n   * `isDeceasing = first &lt;= last;`\r\n\r\n* Maintain a variable holding the value of the previous digit.\r\n\r\n* Iterate over the digits of the given number and compare the next and previous digits.

However, I don&#39;t think you understand how to use lock and notify to gain control over a shared resource. To call `lock.wait(1)` you need to own the lock to start with. \r\n The call releases the lock and returns either if `lock.notify()` or `notifyAll()` was called or if the timeout expires **and** (NOTE) the lock is available to be locked again.  This means that if someone else owns the lock for a long period of time, the `wait(...)` method won&#39;t return unless the lock is released – which could be for many milliseconds.  It is designed to help threads coordinate between themselves.\r\n\r\nIf the question is &quot;does calling `wait(1)` in a calculation loop only give the lock to other people for 1ms&quot; then the answer is no.\r\n\r\nIf you have a resource that can only be used by one thread at a time then the other threads will need to wait until it is available.  You hope that each thread uses the resource for a short amount of time so the waiting is small.\r\n\r\nYou can protect the resource using a couple of different mechanisms.  The easiest is to just put a `synchronized` block around its use.  This protects it from race conditions and ensures that any changes to the resource gets published to main memory in all threads.  No wait or notify calls are required using this mechanism.\r\n\r\nAnother way of doing it is to use `lock.wait(...)` and `lock.notify()`.  This mechanism is required when (for example) threads are consuming from a collection and need to wait for there to be entities added.  In this case, when a thread adds an entity to the collection it calls `lock.notify()` and any thread(s) waiting for work in `lock.wait()` will be notified that there is work to do and will awaken.\r\n\r\nThe use of the `lock.wait(...)` timeout argument means that threads can wait for a certain amount of time for the resource to be available before giving up.  In the queue processing example above, the threads may need to check if the application is shutting down every second or so.  So they call `lock.wait(1000)`, test if the shutdown flag has been set, and if not they can check for work to be done and then call wait again.  Just because you are calling `lock.wait(1)` doesn&#39;t ensure any sort of lock &quot;dominance&quot; and doesn&#39;t mean that the method returns after 1ms.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use wait and notify signaling then you would need a secondary variable to check to see if the resource is in use.  The following example uses an `inUse` boolean field.\r\n\r\n    private final Object lock = new Object();\r\n    private boolean inUse = false;\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    synchronized (lock) {\r\n       while (inUse) {\r\n           lock.wait();\r\n       }\r\n       inUse = true;\r\n    }\r\n    // use the resource\r\n    ...\r\n    synchronized (lock) {\r\n       inUse = false;\r\n       lock.notify();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNotice that the example tests for `inUse` in a `while` loop and not just an `if`.  This is an important pattern and is needed because you could be notified but another thread might have gotten access to the resource while you were waiting.\r\n","title":"Does lock.wait(1) *guarantee* that threads competing over the lock will grab it in this time?","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>QUESTION: Will a thread waiting to grab the lock achieve dominance with ABSOLUTE certainty, if I sprinkle these wait(1) calls into the calculation loop?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The short answer is sort of in that you are always getting the lock when <code>lock.wait(1)</code> returns.

No wait or notify calls are required using this mechanism.</p>\n<p>Another way of doing it is to use <code>lock.wait(...)</code> and <code>lock.notify()</code>.  This mechanism is required when (for example) threads are consuming from a collection and need to wait for there to be entities added.  In this case, when a thread adds an entity to the collection it calls <code>lock.notify()</code> and any thread(s) waiting for work in <code>lock.wait()</code> will be notified that there is work to do and will awaken.</p>\n<p>The use of the <code>lock.wait(...)</code> timeout argument means that threads can wait for a certain amount of time for the resource to be available before giving up.  In the queue processing example above, the threads may need to check if the application is shutting down every second or so.  So they call <code>lock.wait(1000)</code>, test if the shutdown flag has been set, and if not they can check for work to be done and then call wait again.  Just because you are calling <code>lock.wait(1)</code> doesn't ensure any sort of lock &quot;dominance&quot; and doesn't mean that the method returns after 1ms.</p>\n<p>If you want to use wait and notify signaling then you would need a secondary variable to check to see if the resource is in use.  The following example uses an <code>inUse</code> boolean field.</p>\n<pre><code>private final Object lock = new Object();\nprivate boolean inUse = false;\n...\n\nsynchronized (lock) {\n   while (inUse) {\n       lock.wait();\n   }\n   inUse = true;\n}\n// use the resource\n...\nsynchronized (lock) {\n   inUse = false;\n   lock.notify();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that the example tests for <code>inUse</code> in a <code>while</code> loop and not just an <code>if</code>.  This is an important pattern and is needed because you could be notified but another thread might have gotten access to the resource while you were waiting.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":4281210,"reputation":1058,"user_id":3500521,"display_name":"Dreamspace President"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":110,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1666636059,"creation_date":1665688574,"question_id":74060738,"body_markdown":"I have a controller thread that is **permanently** in `synchronized(lock)`: It does a calculation step, then it does `wait(1000)`, then it checks if more work is to be done.

I want to interrupt the process with a dialog presenting the user with a summary of what they entered, a `TextField` containing the default file name and the OK - Cancel buttons. I created a `DialogDisplayer` configured by a `DialogDescriptor` containing a `JPanel` which contains the summary info and file name `JTextField`.

Most of the time, the exception message tells you what the problem is. This is not the case for this issue. However, the exception message tells you enough to figure this out.\r\n\r\nLong story short, the `NullPointerException` is thrown because you don&#39;t understand how to use `getClass().getClassLoader().getResource()` in the proper context. For what you are trying to do, you *probably* don&#39;t even need to use that. You could simply pass a simpler, valid argument to the `ImageIcon` constructor.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s check the `ImageIcon` constructors to see which one you could use.\r\n\r\n```\r\nImageIcon(); // Creates an uninitialized image icon.\r\nImageIcon(byte[]); // Creates an ImageIcon from an array of bytes which were read from an image file containing a supported image format, such as GIF, JPEG, or (as of 1.3) PNG.\r\nImageIcon(Image); // Creates an ImageIcon from an image object.\r\nImageIcon(String); // Creates an ImageIcon from the specified file. The String can be a file name or a file path.\r\nImageIcon(URL); // Creates an ImageIcon from the specified URL.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on the argument you are using in your post, it seems you should pass either the file name or the file path directly into the `ImageIcon` constructor. At worst, you can pass the full path to the image.\r\n\r\nIf your image is inside your project, one way to get the full path is by using `System.getProperty(&quot;user.dir&quot;)`. This property returns the path from where the Java application was launched. This is basically your project. This is a great approach because this path will most likely change. For example, during development, this path can change between developers in a team. Then, when the code is deployed, it will most likely be in a different path. The important thing is that in every case, this path will be resolved by the system automatically for you. You can also pass a relative path from the project&#39;s root and should work just the same.\r\n\r\nThen, all you need to do is append the relative path to your image for the project&#39;s root directory. Do this and your problem will be solved.\r\n\r\nSo... assuming you have an &quot;images&quot; folder as a subfolder of your project&#39;s root directory, you need to replace this line:\r\n```\r\n ImageIcon trippie = new ImageIcon(getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(&quot;trippie200x2001.png&quot;));\r\n```\r\nwith something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nImageIcon trippie = new ImageIcon(&quot;./images/trippie200x2001.png&quot;);\r\n```\r\nor with something like this:\r\n```\r\nImageIcon trippie = new ImageIcon(System.getProperty(&quot;user.dir&quot;) + &quot;/images/trippie200x2001.png&quot;);\r\n```\r\nUsing your code with my own image, I was able to successfully launch your application\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**:\r\n\r\nIn my excitement, I forgot to answer the fundamental question for this issue: How do you fix the *location is &quot;null&quot;* problem using `getClass().getClassLoader().getResource()`?

It only does if a class overrides the default `Object.equals` (which just uses `==`) and implements a content check. Arrays don&#39;t. (One could argue that they should have, but they don&#39;t.) Other classes, like `SimpleDateFormat` and `String` and `Integer` and `HashMap` do.\r\n\r\nIn essence: `==` is always a reference comparison. `equals` may or may not be a contents comparison, depending on what class you&#39;re using it on.\r\n\r\nSo for instance, say we have this class:\r\n\r\n    class Example1\r\n    {\r\n        private int content;\r\n     \r\n        Example1(int content) {\r\n            this.content = content;\r\n        }\r\n     \r\n        public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception\r\n        {\r\n            Example1 a = new Example1(42);\r\n            Example1 b = new Example1(42);\r\n            System.out.println(a == b ? &quot;== Same&quot; : &quot;== Different&quot;);\r\n            System.out.println(a.equals(b) ? &quot;equals Same&quot; : &quot;equals Different&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSince that class doesn&#39;t override `equals`, you&#39;ll get the same answer (&quot;Different&quot;) for both `==` and `equals`. [Live Example][4].\r\n\r\nBut if we override `equals` to define what it would mean for two instances to be equal (in this case: because they have the same content):\r\n\r\n    class Example2\r\n    {\r\n        private int content;\r\n     \r\n        Example2(int content) {\r\n            this.content = content;\r\n        }\r\n     \r\n        @Override\r\n        public boolean equals(Object obj) {\r\n            if (obj == null || !obj.getClass().equals(this.getClass())) {\r\n                return false;\r\n            }\r\n            Example2 other = (Example2)obj;\r\n            return this.content == other.content;\r\n        }\r\n     \r\n        @Override\r\n        public int hashCode() {\r\n            return this.content;\r\n        }\r\n     \r\n        public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception\r\n        {\r\n            Example2 a = new Example2(42);\r\n            Example2 b = new Example2(42);\r\n            System.out.println(a == b ? &quot;== Same&quot; : &quot;== Different&quot;);\r\n            System.out.println(a.equals(b) ? &quot;equals Same&quot; : &quot;equals Different&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow `equals` says two instances with the same content are the same, because the class defines what that means. [Live Example][5]. (Also note that when overriding `equals`, you *must* override `hashCode`, which is why I&#39;ve done so above.)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n\\* More generally, `==` tests if the values of its operands are the same. The value in the case of reference types is an object reference, and two object reference values are only the same when they refer to the same object are are only different when they refer to different objects (or one of them is `null`; not referring to an object at all).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals-java.lang.Object-\r\n  [2]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#equals-int:A-int:A-\r\n  [3]: http://ideone.com/Z4HjHl\r\n  [4]: http://ideone.com/Csr32c\r\n  [5]: http://ideone.com/xGKw3w","title":"What&#39;s the difference between == and .equals in Java?","body":"<p>Yes, <code>==</code> with objects is a reference comparison* (checks if the operands are references to the <em>same</em> object), while <code>equals</code> is whatever the class involved defines it to mean (within the requirements documented for <code>equals</code>).

Other classes, like <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> and <code>String</code> and <code>Integer</code> and <code>HashMap</code> do.</p>\n\n<p>In essence: <code>==</code> is always a reference comparison. <code>equals</code> may or may not be a contents comparison, depending on what class you're using it on.</p>\n\n<p>So for instance, say we have this class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Example1\n{\n    private int content;\n\n    Example1(int content) {\n        this.content = content;\n    }\n\n    public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception\n    {\n        Example1 a = new Example1(42);\n        Example1 b = new Example1(42);\n        System.out.println(a == b ? \"== Same\" : \"== Different\");\n        System.out.println(a.equals(b) ? \"equals Same\" : \"equals Different\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since that class doesn't override <code>equals</code>, you'll get the same answer (\"Different\") for both <code>==</code> and <code>equals</code>. <a href=\"http://ideone.com/Csr32c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Live Example</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But if we override <code>equals</code> to define what it would mean for two instances to be equal (in this case: because they have the same content):</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Example2\n{\n    private int content;\n\n    Example2(int content) {\n        this.content = content;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n        if (obj == null || !obj.getClass().equals(this.getClass())) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        Example2 other = (Example2)obj;\n        return this.content == other.content;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int hashCode() {\n        return this.content;\n    }\n\n    public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception\n    {\n        Example2 a = new Example2(42);\n        Example2 b = new Example2(42);\n        System.out.println(a == b ? \"== Same\" : \"== Different\");\n        System.out.println(a.equals(b) ? \"equals Same\" : \"equals Different\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now <code>equals</code> says two instances with the same content are the same, because the class defines what that means. <a href=\"http://ideone.com/xGKw3w\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Live Example</a>. (Also note that when overriding <code>equals</code>, you <em>must</em> override <code>hashCode</code>, which is why I've done so above.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>* More generally, <code>==</code> tests if the values of its operands are the same. The value in the case of reference types is an object reference, and two object reference values are only the same when they refer to the same object are are only different when they refer to different objects (or one of them is <code>null</code>; not referring to an object at all).</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4592050,"reputation":810,"user_id":3725086,"accept_rate":70,"display_name":"Potato"},"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1497854338,"creation_date":1497854338,"answer_id":44623750,"question_id":44623615,"body_markdown":"the == compare the reference. in your example when you create the variable  arr1[] it created in memory and had it own address in the memory so when you create another variable arr2[] it created in memory but with another address so when you compare arr1 address is not equal to arr2 address. but when you use .equal it does not compare the memeory location but instead it compare the value inside.\r\nif you want arr1 to arr2 == each other it must be like this :\r\n\r\n`arr1[] = [1,2,3]\r\narr2[] = arr1;`\r\n\r\nthen arr1 == arr2 //true","title":"What&#39;s the difference between == and .equals in Java?","body":"<p>the == compare the reference. in your example when you create the variable  arr1[] it created in memory and had it own address in the memory so when you create another variable arr2[] it created in memory but with another address so when you compare arr1 address is not equal to arr2 address. but when you use .equal it does not compare the memeory location but instead it compare the value inside.\nif you want arr1 to arr2 == each other it must be like this :</p>\n\n<p><code>arr1[] = [1,2,3]\narr2[] = arr1;</code></p>\n\n<p>then arr1 == arr2 //true</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1509533,"reputation":424,"user_id":1412000,"display_name":"invenit"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1497858054,"creation_date":1497854856,"answer_id":44623901,"question_id":44623615,"body_markdown":"To create object you need some portion of memory to store it. \r\n\r\nOperator `==` checks if two variables point to the same memory block.
