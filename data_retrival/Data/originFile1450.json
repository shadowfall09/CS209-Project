","title":"Instantiate generic classes with different constructor arguments","body":"<p>I have two similar classes, Foo and Bar</p>\n<pre><code>public class Foo{\n  private String name;\n\n  public Foo(String name){\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n}\n\n\npublic class Bar{\n  private String name;\n\n  public Bar(String name){\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And I've got two methods in another class that creates a Set of Foo (1st method) and Bar (2nd method) and are pretty much the same.\nThe first one:</p>\n<pre><code>private Set&lt;Foo&gt; buildFoos(final List&lt;String&gt; names)\n{\n    final Set&lt;Foo&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; names.size(); i++)\n    {\n        set.add(new Foo(names.get(i)));\n    }\n    return set;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the second one:</p>\n<pre><code>private Set&lt;Bar&gt; buildBars(final List&lt;String&gt; names)\n{\n    final Set&lt;Bar&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; names.size(); i++)\n    {\n        set.add(new Bar(names.get(i)));\n    }\n    return set;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>As you can see, both methods are pretty much the same so I thought I could use generics to use only one method. My approach would be something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>private &lt;T&gt; Set&lt;T&gt; build(final Class&lt;T&gt; clazz, final List&lt;String&gt; names)\n{\n    final Set&lt;T&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; names.size(); i++)\n    {\n        set.add(clazz.getConstructor(String.class).newInstance(names.get(i)));\n    }\n    return set;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I've tested this and it's supposed to be working but my question is, <strong>what would happen if Foo or Bar would have a different constructor</strong> (so for instance, Bar would have another String as the 2nd parameter). All I can think about is to check the instance of the class and pick one of the two constructors (something like this)</p>\n<pre><code>private &lt;T&gt; Set&lt;T&gt; build(final Class&lt;T&gt; clazz, final List&lt;String&gt; names)\n{\n    final Set&lt;T&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; names.size(); i++)\n    {\n        if(clazz.isInstance(Foo.class){\n          set.add(clazz.getConstructor(String.class).newInstance(names.get(i)));\n        }\n        else if(clazz.isInstance(Bar.class){\n          set.add(clazz.getConstructor(String.class, String.class).newInstance(names.get(i), &quot;example&quot;));\n        }\n    }\n    return set;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is there a better way of achieving this?\nIs this even a good practice?\nAny tip is always appreciated.
