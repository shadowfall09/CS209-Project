So I must be missing something as the whole back pressure mechanism in Reactor is described as very transparent and easy to use...</p>\n<p>Here's my publisher:</p>\n<pre><code>@MessageMapping(&quot;events&quot;)\npublic Flux&lt;String&gt; events(String data) {\n    Flux&lt;String&gt; flux = Flux.generate(new Consumer&lt;SynchronousSink&lt;String&gt;&gt;() {\n        long offset = 0;\n\n        @Override\n        public void accept(SynchronousSink&lt;String&gt; emitter) {\n            emitter.next(&quot;&quot; + offset++);\n        }\n    });\n\n    return flux.limitRate(100);  // limitRate doesn't do anything\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And my consumer:</p>\n<pre><code>@Autowired RSocketRequester requester;\n\n@EventListener(ApplicationReadyEvent.class)\npublic void run() throws InterruptedException {\n    requester.route(&quot;events&quot;)\n        .data(&quot;Just Go&quot;)\n        .retrieveFlux(String.class)\n        //.limitRate(1000)  // commenting this line makes publisher go OOM\n        .bufferTimeout(20000, Duration.ofMillis(10))\n        .subscribe(new Consumer&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;() {\n            long totalReceived = 0;\n            long totalBytes = 0;\n\n            @Override\n            public void accept(List&lt;String&gt; s) {\n                totalReceived += s.size();\n                totalBytes += s.stream().mapToInt(String::length).sum();\n                System.out.printf(&quot;So we received: %4d messages @ %8.1f msg/sec (%d kB/sec)\\n&quot;, s.size(), ((double)totalReceived / (System.currentTimeMillis() - time)) * 1000, totalBytes / (System.currentTimeMillis() - time));\n\n                try {\n                    Thread.sleep(200);  // Delay consumer so publisher has to slow down\n                } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                    // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n                    e.printStackTrace();\n                }\n            }\n        });\n\n    Thread.sleep(100000);  // leave Spring running for a bit (dirty)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>What I don't understand why this wouldn't work. The <code>generate</code> uses a call back, but it keeps getting called as fast as possible leading to huge memory allocations in the JVM and it goes OOM. Why does it keep calling <code>generate</code>?</p>\n<p>What am I missing?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","minecraft","minecraft-forge"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":15178500,"reputation":4190,"user_id":10952503,"display_name":"Elikill58"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1643709494,"creation_date":1643709494,"answer_id":70938571,"question_id":70938395,"body_markdown":"You can check if the block is instance of a fluid one like that:\r\n```\r\nboolean isLiquid = block instanceof BlockLiquid || block instance IFluidBlock;\r\n```\r\n[Source](https://forums.minecraftforge.net/topic/36963-1710-check-if-block-is-fluid-source-block/)\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s also possible that you can have `block.getMaterial().isLiquid()`.

And although the Office Open XML specification allows R1C1 there, even Microsoft Excel itself never stores R1C1 formula strings. The old binary `*.xls` file system stores formulas as binary `Ptg` records which are independent of their string representation. The conversion to R1C1 is done in Excel GUI only. It is done by the Excel application while parsing the file. Doing this, it puts in memory two kind of formulas each, one A1 and one R1C1. So both kinds of formulas are available in GUI and in VBA. \r\n\r\nBut `apache poi` does not support R1C1 formulas until now. If it would must then it would must do the conversion programmatically as the Excel application does. But that code is not public available and not reverse engineered from `apache poi` up to now.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nWhen using current `apache poi` versions using reflection will not be necessary anymore. `HSSFSheet` has a method `getSheet` which returns the `InternalSheet` and `InternalSheet` has a method `getRecords` which returns the `List&lt;RecordBase&gt;`.\r\n\r\nSo code could be changed as so:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n       /*\r\n       Field _sheet = HSSFSheet.class.getDeclaredField(&quot;_sheet&quot;);\r\n       _sheet.setAccessible(true); \r\n       InternalSheet internalsheet = (InternalSheet)_sheet.get(hssfSheet); \r\n       */\r\n       InternalSheet internalsheet = hssfSheet.getSheet(); \r\n    \r\n       /*\r\n       Field _records = InternalSheet.class.getDeclaredField(&quot;_records&quot;);\r\n       _records.setAccessible(true);\r\n       @SuppressWarnings(&quot;unchecked&quot;) \r\n       List&lt;RecordBase&gt; records = (List&lt;RecordBase&gt;)_records.get(internalsheet);\r\n       */\r\n       List&lt;RecordBase&gt; records = internalsheet.getRecords();\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"How to detect excel cell reference style of a file using apache POI?","body":"<p>The used reference mode (either A1 or R1C1) can be stored in the Excel files.

The [Java 6 doc][2] doesn&#39;t say anything about override-equivalence. Why the change?\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n-------\r\n\r\nAfter further consulting the JLS ([Section 8.4.2][3]), I found the following explanation of override-equivalence:\r\n\r\n&gt; The signature of a method `m1` is a _subsignature_ of the signature of a method `m2` if\r\n&gt; either:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; - `m2` has the same signature as `m1`, or\r\n&gt; - the signature of `m1` is the same as the erasure ([&#167;4.6][4]) of the signature of `m2`.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; **Two method signatures `m1` and `m2` are _override-equivalent_ iff either `m1` is a\r\n&gt; subsignature of `m2` or `m2` is a subsignature of `m1`.**\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, this answers the first question (&quot;What does it mean?&quot;) and the third question (&quot;Why doesn&#39;t the first condition cover this?&quot;).\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly (please inform me if I don&#39;t!), there is only one case where two methods are override-equivalent and which _doesn&#39;t_ fall under the first condition of the original question. This is the case when the _erasure_ of the signature of the subclass method is the same as the signature of the superclass method, but not the other way around. \r\n\r\nThe second condition of the original question, then, would only come into play when we attempt to add type parameters when attempting to &quot;override&quot; a public method of the `Object` class. I tried the following simple example to test this, with an unused type parameter:\r\n\r\n    public class Foo {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public &lt;T&gt; boolean equals(Object obj) {\r\n            return true;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOf course, this class doesn&#39;t compile, because the method doesn&#39;t _actually_ override the `equals` method and thus clashes with it. But I also still receive a compiler error for using the `@Override` annotation. Am I wrong in assuming that this example meets the second condition for `@Override` usage? Or is the compiler generating this error _despite not being required to_?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Override.html\r\n  [2]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Override.html\r\n  [3]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.2\r\n  [4]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.6","title":"What is &quot;override-equivalence&quot; and how is it related to @Override?","body":"<p>Reading the <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Override.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Javadoc</a> for the <code>@Override</code> annotation, I came across the following rule:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a method is annotated with this\nannotation type compilers are required to generate an error message\nunless at least one of the following conditions hold:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The method does override or implement a method declared in a supertype.</li>\n<li><strong>The method has a signature that is override-equivalent to that of any public method\ndeclared in Object.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm clear on the first point, but I'm unsure about the second one.</p>\n<p>What does it mean by &quot;override-equivalent&quot;?

Why the change?</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Update:</h2>\n<p>After further consulting the JLS (<a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Section 8.4.2</a>), I found the following explanation of override-equivalence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The signature of a method <code>m1</code> is a <em>subsignature</em> of the signature of a method <code>m2</code> if\neither:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>m2</code> has the same signature as <code>m1</code>, or</li>\n<li>the signature of <code>m1</code> is the same as the erasure (<a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">§4.6</a>) of the signature of <code>m2</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Two method signatures <code>m1</code> and <code>m2</code> are <em>override-equivalent</em> iff either <code>m1</code> is a\nsubsignature of <code>m2</code> or <code>m2</code> is a subsignature of <code>m1</code>.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as I can tell, this answers the first question (&quot;What does it mean?&quot;) and the third question (&quot;Why doesn't the first condition cover this?&quot;).</p>\n<p>If I understand correctly (please inform me if I don't!), there is only one case where two methods are override-equivalent and which <em>doesn't</em> fall under the first condition of the original question. This is the case when the <em>erasure</em> of the signature of the subclass method is the same as the signature of the superclass method, but not the other way around.</p>\n<p>The second condition of the original question, then, would only come into play when we attempt to add type parameters when attempting to &quot;override&quot; a public method of the <code>Object</code> class. I tried the following simple example to test this, with an unused type parameter:</p>\n<pre><code>public class Foo {\n    @Override\n    public &lt;T&gt; boolean equals(Object obj) {\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of course, this class doesn't compile, because the method doesn't <em>actually</em> override the <code>equals</code> method and thus clashes with it. But I also still receive a compiler error for using the <code>@Override</code> annotation. Am I wrong in assuming that this example meets the second condition for <code>@Override</code> usage? Or is the compiler generating this error <em>despite not being required to</em>?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","android-studio","kotlin","import"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":17756695,"reputation":64,"user_id":12893649,"display_name":"Ignacio E.

Which you don't.</p>\n<p>That's the reason to why you have to call <code>subscribe</code>, because you need to &quot;wait in the concrete items&quot; so you can place them in your list.</p>\n<p>What you need to do is to start using <code>Flux</code> instead, which is a stream of presumed items.</p>\n<p>i don't know your exact logic here since your code is quite messy, but as an example:</p>\n<pre><code>var labresultList = labReport.getLabResults().getLabResultList();\nMono&lt;List&lt;PollOrderResult&gt; = Flux.fromIterable(labResultList)\n    .flatMap(saveOrphanPollOrderResult(ref, clientId, pollOder, pollResult))\n    .collectList();\n</code></pre>\n<p>And some OT:</p>\n<p>I dont know what your item types are, but please try to avoid using <code>&lt;?&gt;</code> as that will most likely come back to bite you later.</p>\n<p>And please use a bit more functions for readability, as the code is very hard to read, functions are free to use.

SSH is the same method of authentication that Linux servers use to allow remote access.\r\n\r\nSSH keys rely on public-private key authentication. For this method of authentication to work, your Git server must be configured with a public key, and your local machine must have the corresponding private key.\r\n\r\nGit clients like Atlassian and GitHub require that you upload your public key to their dashboards before you can use SSH authentication.\r\n\r\nAn Example Scenario\r\nWe’ve configured a local repository called ck-git. This repository contains one file: `README.md.` \r\n\r\nWe are going to link this repository to one on GitHub. To do this, we can use the git remote command:\r\n\r\n    git remote add origin git@github.com:career-karma-tutorials/ck-git.git\r\n\r\nWe have created a remote called “origin” to which we can push our code. To push our local repository to GitHub, we can use the git push command:\r\n\r\n    git push -u origin master\r\n\r\nThis command uploads our changes to the master branch on our “origin” remote server. Let’s see what happens when we run the command:\r\n\r\n    Permission denied (publickey).\r\n    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you have the correct access rights\r\nand the repository exists.\r\n\r\nWe have encountered an error.\r\n\r\n&gt; Solution #1:\r\n\r\n Check that your key is used\r\nBefore we explore any other solutions, we should make sure that our key is being used to make an SSH connection. We can do this by using the ssh-add command:\r\n\r\neval &quot;$(ssh-agent -s)&quot;\r\nssh-add -l -E md5\r\nThe first command starts the SSH agent on your computer. The next command lists all of the SSH keys that are configured on your machine.\r\n\r\nNow that you have this list of SSH keys, check to see if they match the one you’ve uploaded to GitHub, Bitbucket, or another version control system you use. If at least one of the keys on the list does not match, you need to add one of them to your version control system.\r\n\r\n&gt; Solution #2\r\n\r\n: Adding an SSH key\r\nYou may encounter this error if you have not yet added an SSH key to your version control account. The way in which you add an SSH key to a Git repository varies depending on the version control system you use.\r\n\r\nFor GitHub, you can use the following steps:\r\n\r\nNote down your SSH key using the commands we discussed in Solution #1\r\nOpen GitHub, click on your avatar on the top-right corner and click `“Settings”`\r\nClick “SSH and GPG keys” in the sidebar\r\nAdd an SSH key to your account\r\nTo add an SSH key to your account, you must first have a key. You can generate one using the following commands:\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &quot;email@email.com&quot;\r\n        ssh-add -K ~/.ssh-/id_rsa\r\n\r\nSubstitute “id_rsa” for the name of your key if you changed it when you were prompted to choose a key name from the first command.\r\n\r\nThen, run the following command to see your public key:\r\n\r\n    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\r\n\r\nThis will give you the string you need to upload into your version control system.\r\n\r\nCause #3: Using the wrong method of authentication\r\nWe’ve configured our repository to use an SSH URL:\r\n\r\n    git remote add origin git@github.com:career-karma-tutorials/ck-git.git\r\n\r\nUsing this URL means we must use SSH authorized key pairs to authenticate with our repository. \r\n\r\nThis is only possible if we have set up SSH authentication. If you want to configure your repository with HTTP, which lets you use a username and password to authenticate, you must use an HTTP URL:\r\n\r\n    git remote add origin https://github.com/career-karma-tutorials/ck-git\r\n\r\nWhen we push our code to our remote server, we’ll be asked for our Git username and password. This will give us a chance to authenticate using HTTP instead of SSH.\r\n\r\n&gt; Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe “Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository” error is caused by an issue with the way in which you authenticate with a Git repository.\r\n\r\nTo solve this error, make sure your key is being used on your Git account. If it is not, add your key to Git. If you do not have a public key and want to use one to authenticate with Git, you’ll need to create one.\r\n\r\nYou may want to opt to authenticate using HTTP if you do not want to use SSH. You can do this by using a HTTP URL as the remote URL for your repository.\r\n\r\nref :[https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push","title":"The git-push command failed","body":"<p>SSH keys let you authenticate with a Git repository without worrying about passwords.

To do this, we can use the git remote command:</p>\n<pre><code>git remote add origin git@github.com:career-karma-tutorials/ck-git.git\n</code></pre>\n<p>We have created a remote called “origin” to which we can push our code. To push our local repository to GitHub, we can use the git push command:</p>\n<pre><code>git push -u origin master\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command uploads our changes to the master branch on our “origin” remote server. Let’s see what happens when we run the command:</p>\n<pre><code>Permission denied (publickey).\nfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Please make sure you have the correct access rights\nand the repository exists.</p>\n<p>We have encountered an error.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Solution #1:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Check that your key is used\nBefore we explore any other solutions, we should make sure that our key is being used to make an SSH connection. We can do this by using the ssh-add command:</p>\n<p>eval &quot;$(ssh-agent -s)&quot;\nssh-add -l -E md5\nThe first command starts the SSH agent on your computer. The next command lists all of the SSH keys that are configured on your machine.</p>\n<p>Now that you have this list of SSH keys, check to see if they match the one you’ve uploaded to GitHub, Bitbucket, or another version control system you use. If at least one of the keys on the list does not match, you need to add one of them to your version control system.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Solution #2</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>: Adding an SSH key\nYou may encounter this error if you have not yet added an SSH key to your version control account. The way in which you add an SSH key to a Git repository varies depending on the version control system you use.</p>\n<p>For GitHub, you can use the following steps:</p>\n<p>Note down your SSH key using the commands we discussed in Solution #1\nOpen GitHub, click on your avatar on the top-right corner and click <code>“Settings”</code>\nClick “SSH and GPG keys” in the sidebar\nAdd an SSH key to your account\nTo add an SSH key to your account, you must first have a key. You can generate one using the following commands:</p>\n<pre><code> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &quot;email@email.com&quot;\n    ssh-add -K ~/.ssh-/id_rsa\n</code></pre>\n<p>Substitute “id_rsa” for the name of your key if you changed it when you were prompted to choose a key name from the first command.</p>\n<p>Then, run the following command to see your public key:</p>\n<pre><code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will give you the string you need to upload into your version control system.</p>\n<p>Cause #3: Using the wrong method of authentication\nWe’ve configured our repository to use an SSH URL:</p>\n<pre><code>git remote add origin git@github.com:career-karma-tutorials/ck-git.git\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using this URL means we must use SSH authorized key pairs to authenticate with our repository.</p>\n<p>This is only possible if we have set up SSH authentication. If you want to configure your repository with HTTP, which lets you use a username and password to authenticate, you must use an HTTP URL:</p>\n<pre><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/career-karma-tutorials/ck-git\n</code></pre>\n<p>When we push our code to our remote server, we’ll be asked for our Git username and password. This will give us a chance to authenticate using HTTP instead of SSH.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conclusion</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The “Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository” error is caused by an issue with the way in which you authenticate with a Git repository.</p>\n<p>To solve this error, make sure your key is being used on your Git account. If it is not, add your key to Git. If you do not have a public key and want to use one to authenticate with Git, you’ll need to create one.</p>\n<p>You may want to opt to authenticate using HTTP if you do not want to use SSH. You can do this by using a HTTP URL as the remote URL for your repository.</p>\n<p>ref :<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push</a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":21753539,"reputation":31,"user_id":16059199,"display_name":"tarun nt"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1985,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1643705811,"creation_date":1643703473,"question_id":70937351,"body_markdown":"I am facing this problem for a very long now.I am able to ssh clone the repo and commit to the same repo, but when try `mvn clean release:clean release:prepare release:perform` the build is failing as below.\r\n\r\n    [ERROR] Provider message:\r\n    [ERROR] The git-push command failed.\r\n    [ERROR] Command output:\r\n    [ERROR] username@github.someCompany.com: Permission denied (publickey).\r\n    [ERROR] fatal: Could not read from remote repository.\r\n    [ERROR] \r\n    [ERROR] Please make sure you have the correct access rights\r\n    [ERROR] and the repository exists.\r\nThe thing is when I try to `mvn clean release:clean release:prepare release:perform` it should use `git@github.someCompany.com` instead of `username@github.someCompany.com`.

It&#39;s a question of responsibility (purpose) and change; the two logical components you refer to, a REST API and a repository / system service:\r\n\r\n - **Responsibility**: a REST service cares about working with its callers, so ideally when designing a REST API you should be involving someone from the client-side (client as in caller), because if the API doesn&#39;t work for them it&#39;s not going to be an effective API.  On the other hand, repositories are somewhat self-centered, and may need to consider things that are or no interest to API callers (and vis-versa).\r\n- **Change**: if you pay attention to design principles, like SOLID, you&#39;ll know that part of a system should do one job - as a way of limiting the reasons why it needs to change (see: [SRP][1]).

It's a question of responsibility (purpose) and change; the two logical components you refer to, a REST API and a repository / system service:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Responsibility</strong>: a REST service cares about working with its callers, so ideally when designing a REST API you should be involving someone from the client-side (client as in caller), because if the API doesn't work for them it's not going to be an effective API.  On the other hand, repositories are somewhat self-centered, and may need to consider things that are or no interest to API callers (and vis-versa).</li>\n<li><strong>Change</strong>: if you pay attention to design principles, like SOLID, you'll know that part of a system should do one job - as a way of limiting the reasons why it needs to change (see: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SRP</a>).

So the question to be specific is, how do I make my random 2-D array platform generator, less random so it looks more like a platformer game level as well as adding a bit more variables to it for adding variation to each Map Generated. Explanation below.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I have this:\r\n```java\r\nvoid GenerateMap() {\r\n  int x = width/30;\r\n  int y = height/28;\r\n  int[][] map = new int[x][y];\r\n  //println(map.length);\r\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; map.length; i++) {\r\n    for (int j = 0; j &lt; map[i].length; j++) {\r\n      float val = random(0, 100);\r\n      float nv = noise(val);\r\n      println(nv);\r\n      if (j &lt;= (int) (.5 * map.length)) {\r\n        map[i][j] = nv &lt; .3 ? 0 : 1;\r\n      } else if (j &gt;= (int) (.7 * map.length)) {\r\n        map[i][j] = nv &lt; .6 ? 1 : 0;\r\n      } else {\r\n        map[i][j] = nv &lt;= .3 ? 0 : 1;\r\n      }\r\n      println(i +&quot;-&quot; + j + &quot; - rowcol: &quot; + map[i][j]);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  levelMap = map;\r\n  JSONArray saveArr = arrayToJson(levelMap);\r\n  saveJSONArray(saveArr, dataPath(&quot;./maps/Generation_&quot; + mapGenerations + &quot;.json&quot;), &quot;compact&quot;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt builds a 2d array with 1s and 0s, I tried to make it less random so it looks like a playable terrain. the top-most section will be 0&#39;s (air), the bottom-most will be 1&#39;s (platform).

So the question to be specific is, how do I make my random 2-D array platform generator, less random so it looks more like a platformer game level as well as adding a bit more variables to it for adding variation to each Map Generated. Explanation below.</p>\n<p>Currently, I have this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>void GenerateMap() {\n  int x = width/30;\n  int y = height/28;\n  int[][] map = new int[x][y];\n  //println(map.length);\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; map.length; i++) {\n    for (int j = 0; j &lt; map[i].length; j++) {\n      float val = random(0, 100);\n      float nv = noise(val);\n      println(nv);\n      if (j &lt;= (int) (.5 * map.length)) {\n        map[i][j] = nv &lt; .3 ? 0 : 1;\n      } else if (j &gt;= (int) (.7 * map.length)) {\n        map[i][j] = nv &lt; .6 ? 1 : 0;\n      } else {\n        map[i][j] = nv &lt;= .3 ? 0 : 1;\n      }\n      println(i +&quot;-&quot; + j + &quot; - rowcol: &quot; + map[i][j]);\n    }\n  }\n  levelMap = map;\n  JSONArray saveArr = arrayToJson(levelMap);\n  saveJSONArray(saveArr, dataPath(&quot;./maps/Generation_&quot; + mapGenerations + &quot;.json&quot;), &quot;compact&quot;);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It builds a 2d array with 1s and 0s, I tried to make it less random so it looks like a playable terrain. the top-most section will be 0's (air), the bottom-most will be 1's (platform).

edited the dependencies above and placed exclusions for log4j in the spring-boot-starter-test and the log4j dependencies were gone. But I tested in another project that I have only three dependencies and none of them is spring-boot-starter-test and log4j shows up again, which leads me to my first question, why log4j were gone from the first project if I just placed exclusions in spring-boot-starter-test?\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the exclusions:\r\n\r\n\t&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;exclusions&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;exclusion&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;com.vaadin.external.google&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;android-json&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;/exclusion&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;exclusion&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.logging.log4j&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;log4j-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;/exclusion&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;exclusion&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.logging.log4j&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;log4j-to-slf4j&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;/exclusion&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/exclusions&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd here&#39;s my second project dependencies:\r\n\r\n\t&lt;dependencies&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-actuator&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\n\t\t&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-webflux&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\n\t\t&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;jackson-dataformat-xml&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/dependencies&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd a second question is, shouldn&#39;t all the transitive dependencies be excluded from my final jar independent to its scope to a direct test dependency? I mean, shouldn&#39;t log4j not be included in my final jar since it is inherited by a direct test dependency?","title":"Why does spring-boot include compile transitive dependencies from a test direct dependency?","body":"<p>I am generating my build and I am seeing deployed with my microservice compile transitive dependencies such as log4j, that came with a direct test dependency such as spring-boot-starter-test.

Now I have a question, does anyone have any idea to change these points to positive and negative, for example I have a 51x51 px picture so for x: 0 z: 0 there must be a color from the point x: 26 z: 26 etc. Thank you for any help I have tried everything, sometimes it seems to me that I had a good idea and it will be a breakthrough, but after a while one big XD comes out of it","title":"XY coords to XZ positive/negative coords like minecraft","body":"<p>I recently came up with the idea to color my minecraft map with a picture of colors.
