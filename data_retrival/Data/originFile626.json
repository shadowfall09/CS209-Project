Further, take care to use the result value and run the methods multiple times, to see the impact of first time initialization overhead and the JIT compiler and optimizer.\r\n\r\nGenerally, `Math.pow(x, 2)` is expected to be more expensive than `x * x`, unless the optimizer recognizes that you are using a constant argument.

I have only one JTable and I use the same dtm (DefaultTableModel) for every query.</p>\n<pre><code>\npublic class store extends JPanel{\n    \n    int WIDTH = 1000;\n    int HEIGHT = 600;\n    String[] columnnames = new String[] {&quot;id&quot;, &quot;type&quot;, &quot;cost&quot;};\n    JComboBox jcb;\n    JButton button;\n    DataBaseConnection dbc = new DataBaseConnection();\n    \n    public store() {\n        super();\n        this.setVisible(true);\n        this.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(WIDTH, HEIGHT));\n        this.setBackground(new Color(224, 224, 224));\n        \n        \n        GroupLayout gLayout = new GroupLayout(this);\n        gLayout.setAutoCreateGaps(true);\n        gLayout.setAutoCreateContainerGaps(true);\n        this.setLayout(gLayout);\n        \n         this.jcb = new JComboBox();\n         \n         \n         this.button=new JButton(&quot;Search&quot;);\n         button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {\n             public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {\n                 showTable();\n             }\n         });\n         \n         try { \n                Connection conn;\n                try {\n                    Class.forName(&quot;org.postgresql.Driver&quot;);\n                \n                conn = DriverManager.getConnection(&quot;jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/Try&quot;, &quot;postgres&quot;,\n                        &quot;******&quot;);\n                String sql = &quot;select distinct type from try&quot;;\n                PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement(sql);\n                ResultSet rs2 = ps.executeQuery();\n                while (rs2.next()) {\n\n                    String aS = rs2.getString(1);\n                    jcb.addItem(aS);\n                }\n\n                conn.close();\n\n            } catch (SQLException e) {\n                // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n         } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {\n                // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n         \n         \n         gLayout.setHorizontalGroup(gLayout.createSequentialGroup()\n                 .addGap(400)\n                 .addComponent(jcb).addGroup(\n                    gLayout.createParallelGroup(GroupLayout.Alignment.CENTER).addComponent(button)\n\n            )\n\n\n            );\n            gLayout.setVerticalGroup(gLayout.createSequentialGroup()\n                    .addGap(250)\n                    .addGroup(gLayout.createParallelGroup(GroupLayout.Alignment.CENTER).addComponent(jcb)\n                            .addComponent(button)\n                            )\n                    .addGap(250)\n                    \n\n            );\n        \n        \n    }\n    \n    public void showTable() {\n\n        DefaultTableModel dtm = new DefaultTableModel();\n        \n        JTable t = new JTable();\n        \n        \n        dtm.setColumnIdentifiers(columnnames);\n        \n        JScrollPane pane = new JScrollPane(t);\n        pane.setBounds(25, 120, 850, 150);\n        \n        String ta = jcb.getSelectedItem().toString();\n\n        try { \n            \n            Class.forName(&quot;org.postgresql.Driver&quot;);\n            Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(&quot;jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/Try&quot;,\n                    &quot;postgres&quot;, &quot;*****&quot;);\n            PreparedStatement pstm = conn.prepareStatement(\n                    &quot;SELECT try.* FROM try WHERE type=?&quot;);\n            pstm.setString(1, ta);\n            ResultSet Rs = pstm.executeQuery();\n            \n            \n            \n            while (Rs.next()) {\n                dtm.addRow(new Object[] { Rs.getString(1), Rs.getString(2), Rs.getString(3) });\n            }\n\n            conn.close();\n            \n            \n            t.setModel(dtm);\n            add(pane);

And here I&#39;d like to share some thoughts...\r\n\r\nMost samples/comments will show how to use `ReentrantLock` to solve a problem, but in most cases there is another solution, and it may be even simpler, more clear, more natural. For example, &quot;chain locking&quot; tries to solve the problem of specific sequence of execution. This particular problem can be resolved with appropriate `ExecutorService` (for example with a single threaded executor for sequential execution) and a set of Tasks we put in specific order to be executed. More complex cases can be addressed with something like `java.util.concurrent.Phaser` etc. Or, there is another trick: to schedule next task(s) to be executed in the end of the current one (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67421884/how-to-execute-threads-with-executorservice-in-concrete-order/67441030#67441030). Threads and queues (mostly blocking) are very-very power, natural and canonical way to orchestrate multithreading work, and that way is significantly more safe, than locking.\r\n\r\nFor example, &quot;chain locking&quot; is deadlock-prone if different chains may have different order. Compare &quot;*lock1.lock, do something, lock2.lock, lock1.unlock, do something, lock2.unlock*&quot; and &quot;*lock2.lock, do something, lock1.lock, lock2.unlock, do something, lock1.unlock*&quot;. So, I would recommend to avoid &quot;chain locking&quot; in real design, if possible. The same for classic nested `synchronized` blocks.\r\n\r\nAnother example when a task &quot;should not run in parallel&quot; (`ProtectedExecutable` below) also perfectly can be resolved (by design) with a single threaded executor, and so on.\r\n\r\nThen why we may prefer `ReentrantLock` over `synchronized` in our day-to-day practice?...\r\n\r\nThere is a known small difference in terms of performance between synchronized and `ReentrantLock` in cases of high contention, but not sure that&#39;s really important somewhere out of synthetic tests on specific JDK (Java 15 have disabled biased locking (JEP 374) in the Java virtual machine and this can affect test results).\r\n\r\nI&#39;d say that the only thing I&#39;ve found useful in my personal practice is design-related, and it bases on the fact that *with a lock we can cross method scope*. This is not about a problem which can be resolved with `ReentrantLock` only, but about a case when it may be convenient to use it. When you need a thread safe structure/class with a more or less complex behavior, there are 2 main patterns:\r\n\r\n    // each thread-safe business method is atomic\r\n    // and synchronized\r\n    class A {\r\n      // a lot of fields here\r\n    \r\n      private void doX() {\r\n        // a portion of manipulations with the fields\r\n      }\r\n      private void doY() {\r\n        // another portion of manipulations with the fields\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      public synchronized void threadSafeOperation() {\r\n         doX();\r\n         doY();\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    A a = new A();\r\n    a.threadSafeOperation();\r\n\r\n\r\n    // each thread-safe business method is atomic\r\n    // and synchronized\r\n    class A {\r\n      private final ReenterantLock lock = new ReenterantLock();\r\n      // a lot of fields here\r\n \r\n      public void lock() {\r\n        lock.lock();\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      public void unlock() {\r\n        lock.unlock();\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      public void doX() {\r\n        // a portion of manipulations with the fields\r\n      }\r\n      public void doY() {\r\n        // another portion of manipulations with the fields\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    A a = new A();\r\n    a.lock();\r\n    try {\r\n      a.doX();\r\n      a.doY();\r\n    } finally {\r\n      a.unlock();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first pattern requires each thread-safe operation/usage to be defined as one single synchronized method. The second pattern allows you to use different combinations in different use cases. Each one may be reasonable/preferable in specific case.\r\n\r\nIn the second case we also may say &quot;use synchronized instead of lock&quot;, but specifically and explicitly defined lock/unlock operations say more about our intentions and rules of usage than:\r\n\r\n    A a = new A();\r\n    synchronized(a) {\r\n      a.doX();\r\n      a.doY();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nJava object monitor&#39;s based synchronization (`synchronized` + `wait` + `notify(All)`) helped to resolve all practical problems for years, but one day Doug Lea and Co had decided to develop a rich, object-oriented library of concurrent primitives.
