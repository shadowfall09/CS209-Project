This allows the compiler to generate the code to chase the pointer for you without you having to type it. For instance, if there is a variable &quot;a&quot; in the outer class then the code in your inner class can just do &quot;a=0&quot;, but the compiler will generate code for &quot;outerPointer.a=0&quot; maintaining the hidden pointer under the covers.\r\n\r\nThis means when you create an instance of an inner class you have to have an instance of a outer class to link it to. If you do this creation inside a method of the outer class then the compiler knows to use &quot;this&quot; as the implicit pointer.

This allows the compiler to generate the code to chase the pointer for you without you having to type it.

The reason this doesn&#39;t work is that there is an additional step that is being missed. During the `package` phase, the [Maven JAR Plugin][1] packages files from the `${project.build.outputDirectory}` (by default). An earlier `process-resources` phase copies project resources to this directory from the sources listed in the `project/build/resources` section of the POM. The `process-resources` phase runs _before_ the `compile` phase in the [Maven default lifecycle][2]. That means that the dynamic library is compiled into the `${project.build.directory}/native/lib` directory _after_ that directory has been copied to `${project.build.outputDirectory}`.\r\n\r\nIf it seems to work when running `mvn package`, this is most likely because an existing compiled library already exists in this directory when the `process-resources` phase runs. If you run `mvn clean package` instead, I think you&#39;ll find that the library is missing from the JAR.\r\n\r\nThe reason that running `mvn release:clean release:prepare &amp;&amp; mvn release:perform` _does not_ pick up the existing compiled library is that the Maven Release Plugin creates a fresh clone of the project from source control into a new directory when performing a release, and uses a separate build output directory. This is specifically to avoid the possibility of releasing files that only exist by coincidence on the release machine. So it&#39;s working as intended.\r\n\r\nThe reason that it _does_ include the library in the sources JAR is that the [`source:jar-no-fork`][3] goal binds to the `package` lifecycle phase, which runs after `compile`. Because it is intended to package source code, it adds files from the original sources and resources directories (including the additional `${project.build.directory}/native/lib` resources directory) rather than the build output directory.\r\n\r\nThe intended use of the [Native Maven Plugin][4] is to treat each native library as a separate module, but in this case, the native code is in the same project as the Java code. One possible solution, without restructuring the entire project, would be to bind the `native-maven-plugin` executions to an earlier lifecycle phase, such as `generate-resources`:\r\n\r\n        &lt;executions&gt;\r\n          &lt;execution&gt;\r\n            &lt;id&gt;dylib&lt;/id&gt;\r\n            &lt;phase&gt;generate-resources&lt;/phase&gt;\r\n            &lt;goals&gt;\r\n              &lt;goal&gt;initialize&lt;/goal&gt;\r\n              &lt;goal&gt;compile&lt;/goal&gt;\r\n              &lt;goal&gt;link&lt;/goal&gt;\r\n            &lt;/goals&gt;\r\n          &lt;/execution&gt;\r\n        &lt;/executions&gt;\r\n\r\nAn alternative option may be to configure the `linkerOutputDirectory` parameter of the Native Maven Plugin to output directly into `${project.build.outputDirectory}`, and remove uses of `${project.build.directory}/native/lib`.

To use this solution, you need to know the &quot;network interface&quot; to look on. In my code, this is the 192.168.0.50 . This is the network that my camera that I&#39;m looking to discover is on. To find this, run an `arp -a` command in your cmd prompt (Not sure how to do this on Mac or Linux), and locate the IP of your camera. The interface that it falls under is the one you&#39;ll want to use as that &quot;192.168.0.50&quot;. In my limited understanding, these interfaces basically segment your network, so you need to pick the right one to look for devices on. I think (?) Thomas&#39; code avoids this problem by finding all these network interfaces.This is done in lines 81-100 in [his code](https://github.com/thhart/javaWsDiscovery/blob/master/src/org/me/javawsdiscovery/DeviceDiscovery.java). \r\n\r\n\r\n 2. You MUST give your Probe a unique UUID when you send it. This was one of my errors in doing this; I tested with a hardcoded UUID in the Probe (in the `WS_DISCOVERY_PROBE_MESSAGE`). This will work to discover devices ONCE; but after that, if you send a probe with the same UUID, it seems the devices won&#39;t reply at all. You&#39;ll get no error response either, hence why this was tough fro me to find out. It&#39;s as if the device keeps some internal log of the UUIDs of all the Probe&#39;s its received; and if you send a probe with an old UUID, it just rejects it. Or at least, this is the case for the ONVIF-compliant camera I&#39;m testing with (an AXIS M3045-V). I&#39;m not sure if this behavior is *required* by the ONVIF spec, but it is at least apparent in an AXIS M3045-V.    \r\n\r\n\r\n 3. Notice: SOAP normally relies on HTTP for transfer; but here we use it on top of UDP. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps anyone trying to do something similar. Let me know if there&#39;s anything I can do to help; I&#39;ve read tons of documentation at this point, so I may be able to lend a hand!\r\n\r\n ","title":"How to use WS-Discovery spec to discover ONVIF devices on a network in Java?","body":"<p>Through much trial and error, I have found (another) solution to my problem. mpromonet's is probably the way to go in most cases, I just wanted to avoid using a sizable dependency like Apache.

Ultimately getting this detailed information of the ONVIF devices on the network is my goal. In general I&#39;m also looking for some guidance relating to using the ONVIF Spec.   \r\n      \r\nI am still new to the web service world (and networking in general), so forgive me if I say anything dumb. However, I have put in a lot of effort into this myself: I have read a good deal of [ONVIF Core Spec](https://www.onvif.org/specs/core/ONVIF-Core-Specification.pdf), [ONVIF Application Programmer&#39;s Guide](https://www.onvif.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ONVIF_WG-APG-Application_Programmers_Guide-1.pdf), and [WS-Discovery Specification](http://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/04/discovery/ws-discovery.pdf). If I may I&#39;ll just summarize what I know so you can tell me if I&#39;m on the right track:  \r\n\r\n1. &quot;Web Services&quot; is the name of a standard technology using platform and language independent web service standards such as XML, SOAP, and WSDL over an IP Network. The basic idea is that we want to be able to call what are effectively methods/functions (a service) from any programming language.             \r\n2. A web service is typically hosted on a server; but in the ONVIF use case, the web service provider is the ONVIF device (eg, an IP Camera). Thus to interact with the device from any language we use web service operations / calls, as web service calls can be implemented in any language. \r\n3. XML is the data description syntax (used because it&#39;s language agnostic; any language can parse it). SOAP is the communication protocol used to get SOAP-infused XML documents back and forth (basically, make our method calls). WSDL is used for describing the services (it&#39;s an XML based description of the web services&#39; interface). I have downloaded the WSDL for device management [here](https://www.onvif.org/ver10/device/wsdl/devicemgmt.wsdl), and generated via WSDL compiler `wsimport` (provided by JDK) the Java classes from the WSDL to use in my code. But I understand that calling these methods will come after device discovery, correct?    \r\n4. ONVIF Devices are discovered according WS-Discovery specification. You send a `Probe` message, and devices that match the Probe&#39;s constraints send back a `ProbeMatch` message, as described on page 13 and 14 [in ONVIF Application Programmers Guide](https://www.onvif.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ONVIF_WG-APG-Application_Programmers_Guide-1.pdf)        \r\n\r\n\r\nHere is where I begin to get confused. How exactly do I send this message in Java? The ONVIF Application Programmer&#39;s Guide provides some pseudocode on page 15, but I can&#39;t figure out how to implement it. Section 4.3.1 in that guide specifically is what I&#39;m stuck on. I understand that the &quot;scopes&quot; and &quot;types&quot; are just constraints you can embed in a probe, but they are not required (as per page 5 of [WS discovery spec](http://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/04/discovery/ws-discovery.pdf)). Since I want to discover all devices I figure I need no constraints to start, right?   \r\n\r\nSo that guide also provides a sample SOAP Message on page 110 used for discovery. Removing the type declaration out of it (because I don&#39;t want that constraint), I understand that my SOAP Message to send would be (I believe?) this:    \r\n\r\n```    \r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n&lt;e:Envelope xmlns:e=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope&quot;\r\n xmlns:w=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/08/addressing&quot;\r\n xmlns:d=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/04/discovery&quot;\r\n xmlns:dn=&quot;http://www.onvif.org/ver10/network/wsdl&quot;&gt;\r\n &lt;e:Header&gt;\r\n &lt;w:MessageID&gt;uuid:84ede3de-7dec-11d0-c360-f01234567890&lt;/w:MessageID&gt;\r\n &lt;w:To e:mustUnderstand=&quot;true&quot;&gt;urn:schemas-xmlsoap-org:ws:2005:04:discovery&lt;/w:To&gt;\r\n &lt;w:Action\r\na:mustUnderstand=&quot;true&quot;&gt;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/04/discovery/Pr\r\nobe&lt;/w:Action&gt;\r\n &lt;/e:Header&gt;\r\n &lt;e:Body&gt;\r\n &lt;d:Probe&gt;\r\n &lt;/d:Probe&gt;\r\n &lt;/e:Body&gt;\r\n&lt;/e:Envelope&gt;   \r\n```     \r\n\r\nAnd I also understand the WS-Discovery technology used address 239.255.255.259 with UDP port 3702... but that&#39;s the end of what I get. How do I send that SOAP Message to that address and port in Java? How do I read the response (I *think* that I&#39;ll get back a ProbeMatch message, in the form of an SOAP-infused XML document, so I&#39;ll need to parse that XML to get the `XAddrs`, but not sure). Do I need to send a UDP broadcast of that SOAP message to that address somehow?\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**: I believe to do ONVIF Device Discovery I need to send that SOAP message above to address 239.255.255.259 on UDP Port 3702. I have no clue how to do that in Java and was just looking for some guidance; I&#39;m not even sure I&#39;m on the right track to do device discovery.\r\n","title":"How to use WS-Discovery spec to discover ONVIF devices on a network in Java?","body":"<p>I am trying to discover ONVIF devices with some Java code.

Removing the type declaration out of it (because I don't want that constraint), I understand that my SOAP Message to send would be (I believe?) this:    </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;e:Envelope xmlns:e=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope\"\n xmlns:w=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/08/addressing\"\n xmlns:d=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/04/discovery\"\n xmlns:dn=\"http://www.onvif.org/ver10/network/wsdl\"&gt;\n &lt;e:Header&gt;\n &lt;w:MessageID&gt;uuid:84ede3de-7dec-11d0-c360-f01234567890&lt;/w:MessageID&gt;\n &lt;w:To e:mustUnderstand=\"true\"&gt;urn:schemas-xmlsoap-org:ws:2005:04:discovery&lt;/w:To&gt;\n &lt;w:Action\na:mustUnderstand=\"true\"&gt;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/04/discovery/Pr\nobe&lt;/w:Action&gt;\n &lt;/e:Header&gt;\n &lt;e:Body&gt;\n &lt;d:Probe&gt;\n &lt;/d:Probe&gt;\n &lt;/e:Body&gt;\n&lt;/e:Envelope&gt;   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And I also understand the WS-Discovery technology used address 239.255.255.259 with UDP port 3702... but that's the end of what I get. How do I send that SOAP Message to that address and port in Java? How do I read the response (I <em>think</em> that I'll get back a ProbeMatch message, in the form of an SOAP-infused XML document, so I'll need to parse that XML to get the <code>XAddrs</code>, but not sure). Do I need to send a UDP broadcast of that SOAP message to that address somehow?</p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: I believe to do ONVIF Device Discovery I need to send that SOAP message above to address 239.255.255.259 on UDP Port 3702. I have no clue how to do that in Java and was just looking for some guidance; I'm not even sure I'm on the right track to do device discovery.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":290683,"reputation":12512,"user_id":592355,"display_name":"xerx593"},"score":0,"creation_date":1678228655,"post_id":75667570,"comment_id":133492246,"body_markdown":"Does this answer your question?

I am really sorry about the silly question"},{"owner":{"display_name":"user16422658"},"score":0,"creation_date":1678225844,"post_id":75667328,"comment_id":133491623,"body_markdown":"Does this mean say if I have List&lt;? super BloodOrange&gt; that means I can pass to it a List&lt;BloodOrange&gt;, List&lt;Orange&gt;, List&lt;Object&gt; ?

Given:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBloodOrange a = new BloodOrange();\r\nOrange b = a; // this is, obviously, legal.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe type of the `b` variable is `Orange`, but the object it is pointing at, is actually a BloodOrange. Which is fine. All bloodoranges are oranges. But, therefore, obviously:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBloodOrange a = new BloodOrange();\r\nOrange b = a;\r\nList&lt;Orange&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\nlist.add(b); // this.. has to be legal!\r\nlist.add(a); // it would be ridiculous if this wasn&#39;t, then!\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above compiles completely fine. I just added a bloodorange to a `List&lt;Orange&gt;`. Which, of course, I can do: __All BloodOranges are Oranges__. So why wouldn&#39;t I be able to?\r\n\r\nHence, for the meaning &#39;a list that contain anything that is either an Orange or some subtype of it&#39;, `List&lt;Orange&gt;` is it. Not `List&lt;? extends Orange&gt;`.\r\n\r\n`List&lt;? extends Orange&gt;` has a different meaning. It means:\r\n\r\n_This is a list that is restricted to contain.. I don&#39;t actually know. It has some, unknown to this code, restriction. However, what I do is, that the nature of the restriction is either that it can only contain Oranges (and therefore, BloodOranges are also fine), or, some subtype of Orange._\r\n\r\nIn other words, this is legal:\r\n\r\n```\r\nList&lt;BloodOrange&gt; bloodOranges = new ArrayList&lt;BloodOrange&gt;();\r\nList&lt;? extends Orange&gt; someSortOfOrangesList = bloodOranges;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand now you see why you can&#39;t call `.add(new Orange())` on a `List&lt;? extends Orange&gt;`. After all, java is reference based, the above code contains only one `new` statement __so there is just one list, period__. You merely have 2 variables that both point at the same list - it&#39;s like having an address book with 2 separate pages both listing the same address - that doesn&#39;t magically mean there are now somehow 2 houses. So, if you add something to `someSortOfOrangesList`, you&#39;re also adding it to the list pointed at by variable `bloodOranges`, given that both variables are pointing at the same list. Thus, if you COULD add `.add(new Orange())` to a `List&lt;? extends Orange&gt;`, then I just added a NOT BloodOrange to a list whose type is `List&lt;BloodOrange&gt;` and I just broke it. Hence why the compiler won&#39;t let you, at all.\r\n\r\nOnce you understand this, all is clear:\r\n\r\n&gt;``` java\r\n&gt; List&lt;? super BloodOrange&gt; objects = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n&gt; objects.add(new BloodOrange());\r\n&gt;        //objects.add(new Orange()); // Why doesn&#39;t it work ?\r\n&gt;        //objects.add(new Object()); // Why doesn&#39;t it work ?\r\n&gt; ```\r\n\r\nSame reason: `List&lt;? super BloodOrange&gt;` does not mean &#39;this list can contain bloodoranges or any supertype of it&#39;. Because that&#39;s completely pointless - if you want that, just write `List&lt;Object&gt;`. No, it means: &quot;This List has some unknown to be restriction, however, I do know, that restriction is either BloodOrange, or Orange, or Fruit, or Object. One of those 4, I don&#39;t know which one, but.. it has to be one of those 4 or the compiler wouldn&#39;t have allowed me to write the assignment&quot;.\r\n\r\nAnd with that specific restriction, you CAN add BloodOrange instances to this list. Because `.add(new BloodOrange())` is fine on a `List&lt;Orange&gt;`, it is also fine on a `List&lt;BloodOrange&gt;`, and also fine on a `List&lt;Fruit&gt;`, and also fine on a `List&lt;Object&gt;`.
