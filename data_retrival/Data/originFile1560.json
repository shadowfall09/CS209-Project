So i messed up a bit with the project's settings trying to access all the propper dependencies.</p>\n<p>That caused some unexpected changes on my project's <em>pom.xml</em> file that leaded to the error. So, cloning again de project to a new folder and making the maven re import with some decent internet speed just worked fine for me.\nHope to be helpful. Regards</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":3731288,"reputation":501,"user_id":3103578,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"user1"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":22196,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":39818674,"answer_count":2,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1645821992,"creation_date":1475415734,"question_id":39817610,"body_markdown":"I tried to debug my project but got this \r\n\r\n    SLF4J: Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings.\r\n    SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/usr/local/storm/lib/logback-classic-1.0.13.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\r\n    SLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/home/user/.m2/repository/ch/qos/logback/logback-classic/1.0.13/logback-classic-1.0.13.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\r\n\r\nwhat should i do ? \r\n\r\ni haven&#39;t any dependency for SLF4J in POM just this \r\n\r\n    &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.storm&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;storm-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;version&gt;0.9.6&lt;/version&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n    &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\ni tried to use the solutions i found in similar posts but didn&#39;t solve it !  like \r\n\r\n    &lt;exclusions&gt;\r\n                &lt;exclusion&gt;\r\n                    &lt;groupId&gt;org.slf4j&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;log4j-over-slf4j&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                &lt;/exclusion&gt;\r\n                &lt;exclusion&gt;\r\n                    &lt;groupId&gt;org.slf4j&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;slf4j-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                &lt;/exclusion&gt;\r\n                &lt;exclusion&gt;\r\n                    &lt;groupId&gt;logback-classic&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;ch.qos.logback&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                &lt;/exclusion&gt;\r\n            &lt;/exclusions&gt;\r\n\r\nI tried to replace `provided` to `compile` but didn&#39;t solve it too . \r\n\r\nI got this with using  `mvn dependency:tree`\r\n\r\n     org.slf4j:log4j-over-slf4j:jar:1.6.6:provided \r\n     org.slf4j:slf4j-api:jar:1.7.5:compile\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings","body":"<p>I tried to debug my project but got this </p>\n\n<pre><code>SLF4J: Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings.\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/usr/local/storm/lib/logback-classic-1.0.13.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/home/user/.m2/repository/ch/qos/logback/logback-classic/1.0.13/logback-classic-1.0.13.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>what should i do ? </p>\n\n<p>i haven't any dependency for SLF4J in POM just this </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n        &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.storm&lt;/groupId&gt;\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;storm-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n        &lt;version&gt;0.9.6&lt;/version&gt;\n        &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>i tried to use the solutions i found in similar posts but didn't solve it !  like </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;exclusions&gt;\n            &lt;exclusion&gt;\n                &lt;groupId&gt;org.slf4j&lt;/groupId&gt;\n                &lt;artifactId&gt;log4j-over-slf4j&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;/exclusion&gt;\n            &lt;exclusion&gt;\n                &lt;groupId&gt;org.slf4j&lt;/groupId&gt;\n                &lt;artifactId&gt;slf4j-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;/exclusion&gt;\n            &lt;exclusion&gt;\n                &lt;groupId&gt;logback-classic&lt;/groupId&gt;\n                &lt;artifactId&gt;ch.qos.logback&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;/exclusion&gt;\n        &lt;/exclusions&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I tried to replace <code>provided</code> to <code>compile</code> but didn't solve it too . </p>\n\n<p>I got this with using  <code>mvn dependency:tree</code></p>\n\n<pre><code> org.slf4j:log4j-over-slf4j:jar:1.6.6:provided \n org.slf4j:slf4j-api:jar:1.7.5:compile\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","mongodb","spring-boot","aggregate"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":213468,"reputation":103486,"user_id":466862,"display_name":"Mark Rotteveel"},"score":0,"creation_date":1645818180,"post_id":71270439,"comment_id":125979720,"body_markdown":"I would rather suspect your problem is `into(results)`.

Here is how I have implemented the ApiRequestException: \r\n\r\n 1. I have implemented the ApiRequestException class: \r\n\r\n        public class ApiRequestException extends RuntimeException {\r\n    \r\n          public ApiRequestException(String message) {\r\n            super(message);\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n 2. I have implemented an Exception handler: \r\n\r\n        @ControllerAdvice\r\n        public class ApiExceptionHandler {\r\n        \r\n          @ExceptionHandler(value = { ApiRequestException.class })\r\n          public ResponseEntity&lt;Object&gt; handleApiRequestException(ApiRequestException e) {\r\n            HttpStatus badRequestStatus = HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST;\r\n            ApiRequestError apiRequestError = new ApiRequestError(badRequestStatus, e.getMessage());\r\n            return ResponseEntity.status(badRequestStatus)\r\n                                 .body(apiRequestError);\r\n          }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n 1. Well, as you can see, the exception handler is using an ApiRequestError class. I have implemented this as well: It&#39;s just a class that stores a message-string and an httpStatus. \r\n\r\nWhen debugging my application, I have verified that the exception handler is called. Setting a breakpoint inside my GET-Controller shows that the ApiRequestException is thrown. The exception is handled by the ExceptionHandler. \r\n\r\nSo, anyways, I cannot explain why there is no custom error message in my browser console, but instead what seems to be a default message generated by Spring Boot. Can somebody help?\r\n\r\n===================================================\r\n\r\nupdate: \r\n\r\nAs it turns out, this issue seems to be related to my frontend, not my backend. The code I have presented here works fine. I have tested this by logging the error message in the way described in [this][2] follow-up question.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/K0mUV.png\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71268028/why-does-a-get-request-with-fetch-api-log-a-server-response-error-message-into-t","title":"How to create a custom error message for a spring boot rest aplication","body":"<p>I am using Spring Boot to handle REST calls.
