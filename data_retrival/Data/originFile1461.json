As @pringi mentions, you need to get the public certificate from the server and add it to cacerts. If i remember correctly its just appending the public key to the file. It can take some experimeting, main thing is to get the whole certificate chain into cacerts so Java can verifiy it.

By default, these are not recognized in this way, so anyone trying to scan your code probably would not have gotten any results for Absolute Path Traversal.  It is possible that the risk profile of your application requires that you call properties and environment variables as untrusted inputs, so you can&#39;t really just remove these and revert back to the OOTB settings.\r\n\r\nAs Roman had mentioned, the logic in the query does look for values that are prepended to this untrusted input to remove those data flows as results.  The below code shows how this could be done using Roman&#39;s method to trick the scanner.  (I highly suggest you do not choose the route to trick the scanner.....very bad idea.)  There could be other string literal values that would work using this method, but it would require some actions that control how the runtime is executed (like using chroot) to make sure it actually fixed the issue.\r\n\r\nIf you scan the code below, you should see only one vulnerable data path.  The last example is likely something along the lines of what you could use to remediate the issues.  It really depends on what you&#39;re trying to do with the file being created.  \r\n\r\n(I tested this on 9.2; it should work for prior versions.

Pre-docker, this would have been the method to use.  The vulnerability would have still been detected but most courses of action would have been to say &quot;our deployment environment has security measures around it to prevent a bad actor from injecting an undesired path into the environment variable where we store our base path.&quot;\r\n\r\nBut now, with Docker, this is a thing of the past.  Generally the point of Docker is to create applications that run [the way same everywhere they are deployed](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container).  Using a base path in an environment likely means OP is executing the code outside of a container for development (based on the update showing a Windows path) and inside the container for deployment.  Why not just run the code in the container for development as well as deployment as is intended by Docker?\r\n\r\nMost of the answers tend to explain that OP should use a static path.  This is because they are realizing that there is no way to avoid this issue because taking an untrusted input (from the environment) and prefixing it to a path *is the exact problem of Absolute Path Traversal*.\r\n\r\nOP could follow the good advice of many posters here and put a static base path in the code then use [Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) or [Docker bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/).\r\n\r\nIs it difficult? Nope.  If I were OP, I&#39;d fix the base path prefix in code to a static value of `/app/data` and do a simple volume binding during development.  (When you think about it, if there is storage of data in the container during a deployment then the deployment environment must be doing this exact thing for `/app/data` unless the data is not kept after the lifetime of the container.)\r\n\r\nWith the base path fixed at `/app/data`, one option for OP to run their development build is:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -it -v&quot;C:\\\\projects\\\\app\\\\data&quot;:/app/data {container name goes here}\r\n```  \r\n\r\nAll data written by the application would appear in `C:\\projects\\app\\data` the same way it does when using the environment variables.  The main difference is that there are no environment-variable-prefixed paths and thus no Absolute Path Traversal results from the static analysis scanner.\r\n","title":"checkmarx - How to resolve Stored Absolute Path Traversal issue?","body":"<p>Your first attempt is not going to work because escaping alone isn't going to prevent a path traversal.

If it doesn't work, post your version and I can look into that version's query.)</p>\n<pre><code>// Vulnerable\nString fn1 = System.getProperty (&quot;test&quot;);\nFile f1 = new File(fn1);\n\n\n// Path prepend - still vulnerable, tricks the scanner, DO NOT USE\nString fn2 = System.getProperty (&quot;test&quot;);\nFile f2 = new File(Paths.get (&quot;&quot;, fn2).toString () );\n\n// Path prepend - still vulnerable, tricks the scanner, DO NOT USE\nString fn3 = System.getProperty (&quot;test&quot;);\nFile f3 = new File(&quot;&quot; + fn3);\n\n// Path prepend - still vulnerable, tricks the scanner, DO NOT USE\nString fn4 = System.getProperty (&quot;test&quot;);\nFile f4 = new File(&quot;&quot;, fn4);\n\n// Sanitized by stripping path separator as defined in the JDK\n// This would be the safest method\nString fn5 = System.getProperty (&quot;test&quot;);\nFile f5 = new File(fn5.replaceAll (File.separator, &quot;&quot;));\n\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, in summary (TL;DR), replace the file separator in the untrusted input value:</p>\n<pre><code>String fn5 = System.getProperty (&quot;test&quot;);\nFile f5 = new File(fn5.replaceAll (File.separator, &quot;&quot;));\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>\nUpdating for other Checkmarx users that may come across this in search of an answer.</p>\n<p>After my answer, OP updated the question to reveal that the issue being found was due to a mechanism written for the code to run in different environments.  Pre-docker, this would have been the method to use.  The vulnerability would have still been detected but most courses of action would have been to say &quot;our deployment environment has security measures around it to prevent a bad actor from injecting an undesired path into the environment variable where we store our base path.&quot;</p>\n<p>But now, with Docker, this is a thing of the past.  Generally the point of Docker is to create applications that run <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the way same everywhere they are deployed</a>.  Using a base path in an environment likely means OP is executing the code outside of a container for development (based on the update showing a Windows path) and inside the container for deployment.  Why not just run the code in the container for development as well as deployment as is intended by Docker?</p>\n<p>Most of the answers tend to explain that OP should use a static path.  This is because they are realizing that there is no way to avoid this issue because taking an untrusted input (from the environment) and prefixing it to a path <em>is the exact problem of Absolute Path Traversal</em>.</p>\n<p>OP could follow the good advice of many posters here and put a static base path in the code then use <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Docker volumes</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Docker bind mounts</a>.</p>\n<p>Is it difficult? Nope.  If I were OP, I'd fix the base path prefix in code to a static value of <code>/app/data</code> and do a simple volume binding during development.  (When you think about it, if there is storage of data in the container during a deployment then the deployment environment must be doing this exact thing for <code>/app/data</code> unless the data is not kept after the lifetime of the container.)</p>\n<p>With the base path fixed at <code>/app/data</code>, one option for OP to run their development build is:</p>\n<pre><code>docker run -it -v&quot;C:\\\\projects\\\\app\\\\data&quot;:/app/data {container name goes here}\n</code></pre>\n<p>All data written by the application would appear in <code>C:\\projects\\app\\data</code> the same way it does when using the environment variables.  The main difference is that there are no environment-variable-prefixed paths and thus no Absolute Path Traversal results from the static analysis scanner.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":20316762,"reputation":39,"user_id":14902492,"display_name":"Asaf Ben-Natan"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1610764102,"creation_date":1610709422,"answer_id":65735143,"question_id":65106898,"body_markdown":"how about using Java&#39;s Path to make the check(&quot;../test1.txt&quot; is the input from user):\r\n\r\n    File base=new File(&quot;/your/base&quot;);\r\n    Path basePath=base.toPath();\r\n    Path resolve = basePath.resolve(&quot;../test1.txt&quot;);\r\n    Path relativize = basePath.relativize(resolve);\r\n    if(relativize.startsWith(&quot;..&quot;)){\r\n        throw new Exception(&quot;invalid path&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n","title":"checkmarx - How to resolve Stored Absolute Path Traversal issue?","body":"<p>how about using Java's Path to make the check(&quot;../test1.txt&quot; is the input from user):</p>\n<pre><code>File base=new File(&quot;/your/base&quot;);\nPath basePath=base.toPath();\nPath resolve = basePath.resolve(&quot;../test1.txt&quot;);\nPath relativize = basePath.relativize(resolve);\nif(relativize.startsWith(&quot;..&quot;)){\n    throw new Exception(&quot;invalid path&quot;);\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3282,"reputation":146296,"user_id":4725,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Tom Hawtin - tackline"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1610885454,"creation_date":1610885454,"answer_id":65760417,"question_id":65106898,"body_markdown":"If there is one thing to remember it is this\r\n\r\n**use allow lists not deny lists**\r\n\r\n(traditionally known as whitelists and blacklists).\r\n\r\nFor instance, consider replacing `/../` with `/` suggested in another answer.
