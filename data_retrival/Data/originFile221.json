The problem is a semantic/philosophy argument: What does `protected` really _mean_?\r\n\r\nSure, it&#39;s defined as: &quot;Only accessible / visible by anything else in the same package, and any subclasses&quot;.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I write:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass ClassB extends ClassA {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere ClassB and ClassA are _not_ in the same package, and ClassA has hypotetically `protected` access level, how does the chicken and egg situation work? In order to &#39;parse and understand&#39; `extends ClassA`, we need to be in a valid context (in the same package, or be a subclass), but we aren&#39;t in that context quite yet.\r\n\r\nWe can update the lang spec to decree that for the purposes of understanding any `extends` or `implements` clauses, that we should act as if we are in the right context for the purposes of `protected`. But that is an additional complication.\r\n\r\nHence, instead, the spec erred on the side of caution and simply doesn&#39;t allow it.\r\n\r\nSo, to answer your _direct_ question:\r\n\r\nQ: Why can&#39;t we we have protected top level class in java?\r\n\r\nA: __Because the spec says so__.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s it. That&#39;s the answer.\r\n\r\nI assume you find that answer not very satisfying. But it is the answer.\r\n\r\nSo let&#39;s instead answer your underlying question, which is _actually_:\r\n\r\nQ: I have a class (`ClassA`) that I do not want any code outside of `ClassA`&#39;s package to be able to access - I do not want any code to invoke static methods or read static fields (`ClassA.someStaticMethod()`), and I do not want any code to be able to create new instances (`new ClassA()`) either. However, I __do__ want code outside of `ClassA`&#39;s package to write `extends ClassA`.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, the answer there is: That is a bizarre question, and I (and, evidently, the authors of the java language specification) cannot fathom any realistic scenarios where you&#39;d want such an access level.\r\n\r\nThere is no access level modifier that means: &quot;This method is not accessible to code outside of the class, __except__ for source files who source file name starts with the letter &#39;Q&#39;, _those_ can access it&quot;. For the same reason: That&#39;s so bizarre the authors didn&#39;t foresee any need for it, and therefore, the language doesn&#39;t support it.\r\n\r\nI suggest you make it `public`, and document it accordingly. Alternatively, consider that the only useful things you can do with a class __are always focused on members of it__. There&#39;s nothing useful you can do with, literally:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass ExampleUselessClass {\r\n // the class is completely empty. There is nothing here.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen who cares what the access level of that class is? It&#39;s not useful, in any way.\r\n\r\nThus, you can effectively get what you want _by making every __member__ within `ClassA` protected instead_.\r\n\r\nIf you have:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class ClassA {\r\n\r\n  protected static final String SOME_CONSTANT = &quot;Hello&quot;;\r\n  protected int someField = 5;\r\n\r\n  protected ClassA() {\r\n    // our constructor\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  protected void foo() {\r\n    // some method\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen explain to me what code in other packages can do, that _you do not want it to do_? Think it through. Other code can&#39;t write `new ClassA()` (unless they `extends ClassA`), they can&#39;t write `ClassA.SOME_CONSTANT`, they can&#39;t write `someInstanceOfClassB.foo()` unless you override `foo()` in `ClassB`. What&#39;s left, other than academic pointless cases, such as, say:\r\n\r\n```\r\nClass&lt;?&gt; classRef = ClassA.class;\r\n```\r\n\r\nrestricted access levels (`private`, package private, `protected`) __are API access tools__: They let you mark parts of your API as: &quot;Hey, I do not feel like documenting precisely what these methods do, and I reserve the right to modify this stuff in backwards incompatible ways in point releases.&quot;.\r\n\r\nIt doesn&#39;t mean anything further. access levels aren&#39;t security tools. Code that wants to &#39;access private stuff&#39; can do so trivially (using reflection, or just hacking the class file, that&#39;s trivial to do). That&#39;s not the point of `private` and friends. Whatever&#39;s left isn&#39;t API related and therefore isn&#39;t relevant. There&#39;s no purpose to denying other code from writing `ClassA.class` or otherwise referring to the existence of `ClassA` itself (not to anything it can do, i.e. any of its fields/methods/inner types).\r\n","title":"Why ant we have protected top level class in java?","body":"<p>In basis, what you asked for is <strong>not possible</strong>.

In order to 'parse and understand' <code>extends ClassA</code>, we need to be in a valid context (in the same package, or be a subclass), but we aren't in that context quite yet.</p>\n<p>We can update the lang spec to decree that for the purposes of understanding any <code>extends</code> or <code>implements</code> clauses, that we should act as if we are in the right context for the purposes of <code>protected</code>. But that is an additional complication.</p>\n<p>Hence, instead, the spec erred on the side of caution and simply doesn't allow it.</p>\n<p>So, to answer your <em>direct</em> question:</p>\n<p>Q: Why can't we we have protected top level class in java?</p>\n<p>A: <strong>Because the spec says so</strong>.</p>\n<p>That's it. That's the answer.</p>\n<p>I assume you find that answer not very satisfying. But it is the answer.</p>\n<p>So let's instead answer your underlying question, which is <em>actually</em>:</p>\n<p>Q: I have a class (<code>ClassA</code>) that I do not want any code outside of <code>ClassA</code>'s package to be able to access - I do not want any code to invoke static methods or read static fields (<code>ClassA.someStaticMethod()</code>), and I do not want any code to be able to create new instances (<code>new ClassA()</code>) either. However, I <strong>do</strong> want code outside of <code>ClassA</code>'s package to write <code>extends ClassA</code>.</p>\n<p>But, unfortunately, the answer there is: That is a bizarre question, and I (and, evidently, the authors of the java language specification) cannot fathom any realistic scenarios where you'd want such an access level.</p>\n<p>There is no access level modifier that means: &quot;This method is not accessible to code outside of the class, <strong>except</strong> for source files who source file name starts with the letter 'Q', <em>those</em> can access it&quot;. For the same reason: That's so bizarre the authors didn't foresee any need for it, and therefore, the language doesn't support it.</p>\n<p>I suggest you make it <code>public</code>, and document it accordingly. Alternatively, consider that the only useful things you can do with a class <strong>are always focused on members of it</strong>. There's nothing useful you can do with, literally:</p>\n<pre><code>class ExampleUselessClass {\n // the class is completely empty. There is nothing here.\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then who cares what the access level of that class is? It's not useful, in any way.</p>\n<p>Thus, you can effectively get what you want <em>by making every <strong>member</strong> within <code>ClassA</code> protected instead</em>.</p>\n<p>If you have:</p>\n<pre><code>public class ClassA {\n\n  protected static final String SOME_CONSTANT = &quot;Hello&quot;;\n  protected int someField = 5;\n\n  protected ClassA() {\n    // our constructor\n  }\n\n  protected void foo() {\n    // some method\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then explain to me what code in other packages can do, that <em>you do not want it to do</em>? Think it through. Other code can't write <code>new ClassA()</code> (unless they <code>extends ClassA</code>), they can't write <code>ClassA.SOME_CONSTANT</code>, they can't write <code>someInstanceOfClassB.foo()</code> unless you override <code>foo()</code> in <code>ClassB</code>. What's left, other than academic pointless cases, such as, say:</p>\n<pre><code>Class&lt;?&gt; classRef = ClassA.class;\n</code></pre>\n<p>restricted access levels (<code>private</code>, package private, <code>protected</code>) <strong>are API access tools</strong>: They let you mark parts of your API as: &quot;Hey, I do not feel like documenting precisely what these methods do, and I reserve the right to modify this stuff in backwards incompatible ways in point releases.&quot;.</p>\n<p>It doesn't mean anything further. access levels aren't security tools. Code that wants to 'access private stuff' can do so trivially (using reflection, or just hacking the class file, that's trivial to do). That's not the point of <code>private</code> and friends. Whatever's left isn't API related and therefore isn't relevant. There's no purpose to denying other code from writing <code>ClassA.class</code> or otherwise referring to the existence of <code>ClassA</code> itself (not to anything it can do, i.e. any of its fields/methods/inner types).</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":20082852,"reputation":13,"user_id":14725111,"display_name":"zenmonkey"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1693270002,"accepted_answer_id":76984056,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1693070375,"creation_date":1693067319,"question_id":76983870,"body_markdown":"If i have a top level class classA in packageA, and i want to make a classB extend classA, but i want to include classB in packageB, without any other class in packageB being able to have access to classA (so classA cannot be public), wouldnt this mean that classA must be accessible to its own package plus its children that are in other packages, hence shouldnt classA be protected?\r\nobviously we can solve this by moving classB to packageA but what if we cannot do for some reason?\r\n\r\nalright i guess i have to fill this in too, i tried making classA protected and i got an error.","title":"Why ant we have protected top level class in java?","body":"<p>If i have a top level class classA in packageA, and i want to make a classB extend classA, but i want to include classB in packageB, without any other class in packageB being able to have access to classA (so classA cannot be public), wouldnt this mean that classA must be accessible to its own package plus its children that are in other packages, hence shouldnt classA be protected?\nobviously we can solve this by moving classB to packageA but what if we cannot do for some reason?</p>\n<p>alright i guess i have to fill this in too, i tried making classA protected and i got an error.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","list","data-structures"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"display_name":"user153498"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1255971187,"creation_date":1255971187,"answer_id":1589842,"question_id":1589813,"body_markdown":"If you want the array of items to expand (i.e. if you don&#39;t know what the size of the list will be beforehand), a List will be beneficial.

I generated two JAR files and a directory with all the JAR files. I compared the results and definitely the *maven-shade-plugin* is the best.\r\n\r\nMy challenge was that I have multiple [Spring][1] resources that needed to be merged, as well as jax-rs, and [JDBC][2] services. They were all merged properly by the shade plugin in comparison with the *maven-assembly-plugin*. In which case Spring will fail unless you copy them to your own resources folder and merge them manually one time.\r\n\r\nBoth plugins output the correct dependency tree.

They both produced the same manifest, but I was able to consolidate licenses with the shade plugin using their transformer.\r\nWith the *maven-dependency-plugin* of course you don&#39;t have those problems, because the JAR files are not extracted.

in this post. I generated two JAR files and a directory with all the JAR files. I compared the results and definitely the <em>maven-shade-plugin</em> is the best.</p>\n<p>My challenge was that I have multiple <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Spring</a> resources that needed to be merged, as well as jax-rs, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JDBC</a> services. They were all merged properly by the shade plugin in comparison with the <em>maven-assembly-plugin</em>. In which case Spring will fail unless you copy them to your own resources folder and merge them manually one time.</p>\n<p>Both plugins output the correct dependency tree. I had multiple scopes like test, provide, compile, etc. The test and provided were skipped by both plugins. They both produced the same manifest, but I was able to consolidate licenses with the shade plugin using their transformer.\nWith the <em>maven-dependency-plugin</em> of course you don't have those problems, because the JAR files are not extracted. But like some other have pointed out, you need to carry one extra file(s) to work properly.</p>\n<p>Here is a snip of the <em>pom.xml</em> file:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;plugin&gt;\n

I know that I could swap my layout to using [`CardLayout`][3] or something instead, but the application I am building is more of a dashboard, and therefore, having all the elements viewable at once is rather important. And this lack of horizontal space is for a maximized window, so maximizing isn&#39;t an option.\r\n\r\nWell, as it turns out, the other 2 components had horizontal space to spare, so I thought to myself, &quot;Why don&#39;t I just move the 2 big components into the same column, the 2 small components into the other column, and then resize the column so that they both have the adequate space they need?&quot;\r\n\r\nHere is a simple visual representation of what I mean.\r\n\r\n[![Image of 2 grids, demonstrating the current state on the left side, and my desired state on the right side.

Of all the layouts, [GridBagLayout][6] seemed to be the best fit for my needs.\r\n\r\nSo, I took a look at the [tutorial for `GridBagLayout`][7]. My first goal was to recreate what I already have with `GridLayout`, then manipulate that solution until it looks like what I needed.\r\n\r\nHere is my first, naive attempt.

The components are all scrunched in the middle.\r\n\r\n`GridLayout` ensures that each component takes up all available vertical and horizontal space. I need this if I am going to be using `GridBagLayout`. After all, the entire reason why I just switched over to `GridBagLayout` was to be able to squeeze out just a little more horizontal width. What I have now is a step backwards.\r\n\r\nSo, I read through the tutorial again, thoroughly this time, and saw the following quote.\r\n\r\n&gt; fill\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Used when the component&#39;s display area is larger than the component&#39;s requested size to determine whether and how to resize the component. Valid values (defined as GridBagConstraints constants) include NONE (the default), HORIZONTAL (make the component wide enough to fill its display area horizontally, but do not change its height), VERTICAL (make the component tall enough to fill its display area vertically, but do not change its width), and **BOTH (make the component fill its display area entirely)**.\r\n\r\nReading that, I tried to add a `c.fill = GridBagConstraints.BOTH;` for each of the components. However, the result was 100% the same. No difference between the first version and the second version.\r\n\r\nReading through a second time, I noticed the following quote.\r\n\r\n&gt; A GridBagLayout places components in a grid of rows and columns, allowing specified components to span multiple rows or columns. Not all rows necessarily have the same height. Similarly, not all columns necessarily have the same width. Essentially, GridBagLayout places components in rectangles (cells) in a grid, and **then uses the components&#39; preferred sizes to determine how big the cells should be**.\r\n\r\nReading that, I started trying out different preferred sizes. That had an impact, but not quite what I wanted. Now my GUI doesn&#39;t resize correctly. The preferredSize that I provide is what the component stays at. I need my components to take up all horizontal space. If my display area increases or decreases in size, I need my components to follow suit while maintaining proportion to each other.\r\n\r\nSo, I tried to reread the tutorial again and found the following quote.\r\n\r\n&gt; For example, to make button 4 be extra tall, the example has this code:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; c.ipady = 40;\r\n\r\nSo, I tried ipadx, but it didn&#39;t change anything. It looked the same as my first 2 attempts.\r\n\r\nFinally, I tried to reread the tutorial again, but nothing else seemed like it would work for my solution.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/GridLayout.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/JPanel.html\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/CardLayout.html\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/nN8G9.png\r\n  [5]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/visual.html\r\n  [6]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/GridBagLayout.html\r\n  [7]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/gridbag.html","title":"Struggling to create an uneven grid in Swing","body":"<p>I have a working application that uses <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/GridLayout.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>GridLayout</code></a> to make a 2 by 2 grid, each containing a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/JPanel.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>JPanel</code></a>.</p>\n<p>The <code>GridLayout</code> worked just fine, I just did <code>mainPanel.setLayout(new GridLayout(2, 2))</code>, and everything worked out just fine.</p>\n<p>However, I noticed that 2 of my components were a little cramped (horizontally) inside of the grid.
