The reason why it doesn&#39;t keep storing increments of 5 into your &#39;i&#39; variable is because when you use the &#39;==&#39; operator in java, you&#39;re telling the program to check to see if two strings are the same **object**, but that&#39;s not what you want. You want to use the &#39;str.equals()&#39; method when you want to see if two strings share the exact same characters.

The reason why it doesn't keep storing increments of 5 into your 'i' variable is because when you use the '==' operator in java, you're telling the program to check to see if two strings are the same <strong>object</strong>, but that's not what you want. You want to use the 'str.equals()' method when you want to see if two strings share the exact same characters. Since your if statement checks to see if these strings are equal and it's not passing because of your conditions not being setup properly, it's not able to increment the value of 'i'.

Don&#39;t think about how to call a method from one thread and have it execute on a different thread. Instead, think about how to pass objects between threads. You want to give your &quot;worker thread&quot; a message to send. So, you need to figure out how to give that message _object_ to said thread.\r\n\r\nEssentially, you need to provide a &quot;synchronization point&quot; where you can pass data (or even actions, e.g., as `Runnable`s&lt;sup&gt;**1**&lt;/sup&gt;) between threads. There are quite a few ways you can do this. And how exactly you decide to do this depends on how exactly this &quot;worker thread&quot; of yours is supposed to work. Regardless, I recommend doing some research into Java concurrency. Take a look at:\r\n\r\n* Concurrency tutorials (e.g., [this one][4] or [this one][5], among many others, including full books).\r\n\r\n* The `synchronized` keyword and the corresponding `wait`, `notify`, and `notifyAll` methods (all declared in `Object`).\r\n\r\n* The [`java.util.concurrent`][1], [`java.util.concurrent.atomic`][2], and [`java.util.concurrent.locks`][3] packages.\r\n\r\n* [Concurrency in JavaFX][6] and the [`javafx.concurrent`][7] package (both JavaFX-specific; you included the [tag:javafx] tag).\r\n\r\n\r\nConcurrency is hard, and it&#39;s going to take some work to become proficient with it.\r\n\r\nThat said, if your &quot;worker thread&quot; is meant to send multiple messages as the user enters them, then probably one of the easiest solutions is to use a [`BlockingQueue`][8]. Here&#39;s an example (in JavaFX, given the [tag:javafx] tag):\r\n\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\nimport java.util.Objects;\r\nimport java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue;\r\nimport java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;\r\nimport java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;\r\nimport java.util.concurrent.Executors;\r\nimport javafx.application.Application;\r\nimport javafx.geometry.Insets;\r\nimport javafx.scene.Scene;\r\nimport javafx.scene.control.Button;\r\nimport javafx.scene.control.TextField;\r\nimport javafx.scene.layout.HBox;\r\nimport javafx.scene.layout.Priority;\r\nimport javafx.stage.Stage;\r\n\r\npublic class Main extends Application {\r\n\r\n  private ExecutorService executor;\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void start(Stage primaryStage) {\r\n    executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();\r\n\r\n    BlockingQueue&lt;String&gt; messageQueue = new ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;&gt;(10);\r\n    executor.execute(new Messenger(messageQueue));\r\n\r\n    TextField inputField = new TextField();\r\n\r\n    Button sendBtn = new Button(&quot;Send&quot;);\r\n    sendBtn.setDefaultButton(true);\r\n    sendBtn.setOnAction(e -&gt; {\r\n      e.consume();\r\n\r\n      String message = inputField.getText();\r\n      if (message != null &amp;&amp; !message.isEmpty()) {\r\n        System.out.printf(\r\n            &quot;[%s] Enqueueing message: &#39;%s&#39;%n&quot;,\r\n            Thread.currentThread().getName(),\r\n            message  \r\n        );\r\n        messageQueue.add(message);\r\n        inputField.clear();\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    HBox root = new HBox(10, inputField, sendBtn);\r\n    root.setPadding(new Insets(10));\r\n    HBox.setHgrow(inputField, Priority.ALWAYS);\r\n\r\n    primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(root, 600, -1));\r\n    primaryStage.setTitle(&quot;JavaFX Demo&quot;);\r\n    primaryStage.show();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public void stop() {\r\n    executor.shutdownNow();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private static class Messenger implements Runnable {\r\n\r\n    private final BlockingQueue&lt;String&gt; queue;\r\n\r\n    Messenger(BlockingQueue&lt;String&gt; queue) {\r\n      this.queue = Objects.requireNonNull(queue, &quot;queue&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void run() {\r\n      try {\r\n        searchForConnections();\r\n        while (!Thread.interrupted()) {\r\n          String message = queue.take();\r\n          sendMessage(message);\r\n        }\r\n      } catch (InterruptedException ignore) {\r\n        // If the thread is interrupted, we simply want to stop\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void searchForConnections() {}\r\n\r\n    private void sendMessage(String message) {\r\n      System.out.printf(\r\n          &quot;[%s] Sending message: &#39;%s&#39;%n&quot;,\r\n          Thread.currentThread().getName(),\r\n          message\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote how this actually works. We aren&#39;t calling a method from one thread, but having it execute on another. We have the background thread (your &quot;worker thread&quot;) blocked on the `BlockingQueue` waiting for messages to send. When the _JavaFX Application Thread_ (the UI thread) places a `String` in the queue, the background thread takes it and calls `sendMessage` with the `String`.\r\n\r\nAlso, in case there&#39;s some confusion here, note how we do not create nor manage the UI thread. That is handled by the UI framework, and the thread is already running in essentially a loop that processes user-generated events and syncs the rendered UI with the state of the scene graph.\r\n\r\nIf you run the above example, type `Hello, World!` into the text field, and then trigger the &lt;kbd&gt;Send&lt;/kbd&gt; button, you should see something like:\r\n\r\n```lang-none\r\n[JavaFX Application Thread] Enqueueing message: &#39;Hello, World!&#39;\r\n[pool-2-thread-1] Sending message: &#39;Hello, World!&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrinted to the console.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;**1.** One of the main `ExecutorService` implementations, `ThreadPoolExecutor`, works on this principle. It maintains a `BlockingQueue&lt;Runnable&gt;` and a pool of threads. These threads essentially loop trying to take a `Runnable` from the queue and then calling its `run()` method. The queue is populated by calling e.g., `execute` and `submit` on the `ExecutorService`. And that&#39;s one way you can give a &quot;task&quot; to another thread. It&#39;s also how the above example executes `Messenger` on a background thread.&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/atomic/package-summary.html\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/locks/package-summary.html\r\n  [4]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/\r\n  [5]: https://jenkov.com/tutorials/java-concurrency/index.html\r\n  [6]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/interoperability-tutorial/concurrency.htm#JFXIP546\r\n  [7]: https://openjfx.io/javadoc/19/javafx.graphics/javafx/concurrent/package-summary.html\r\n  [8]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/19/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html","title":"How to call a method on one running thread but execute it on another running thread?","body":"<p>I believe you've got a slight conceptual misunderstanding.

Definition of SHA256withRSA ####\r\n\r\n\r\n`&quot;SHA256withRSA&quot;` implements the PKCS#1 v1.5 padding and modular exponentiation with the formal name [RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8017#section-8.2) after calculating the hash over the data using SHA256. \r\n\r\n## Signature generation ##\r\n\r\nThe general strategy for signature generation is:\r\n\r\n 1. **hashing the message;**\r\n 2. **padding the hash for signature generation;**\r\n 3. conversion of the previous result to a number using OS2IP;\r\n 4. **modular exponentiation using the **private** exponent and the modulus;**\r\n 5. conversion of the previous result to an octet string using I2OSP.\r\n\r\n## Signature verification ##\r\n\r\nThe strategy for signature verification consists of two parts.\r\n\r\nPart 1:\r\n\r\n 1. **hashing;**\r\n 2. **padding the hash using the same method used for signature generation;**\r\n\r\nThe result of part 1 is the locally generated padded hash (called EM&#39;).\r\n\r\nPart 2:\r\n\r\n 1. conversion of the signature to a number using OS2IP;\r\n 2. **modular exponentiation using the **public** exponent and the modulus;**\r\n 3. conversion of the previous result to an octet string using I2OSP.\r\n\r\nThe result of part 2 is the original padded hash (called EM).\r\n\r\nFinally the original and local padded hashes (EM and EM&#39;) are compared; the signature verifies if the comparison succeeds. \r\n\r\n## Notes ###\r\n\r\n - The PSS scheme in PKCS#1 v2.0 onward has been designed to provide a non-deterministic scheme with a better security proof for the padding. For new protocols it is advisable to use the PSS scheme instead, although the PKCS#1 v1.5 scheme is still considered secure.\r\n\r\n - The modular exponentiation during signature generation may not use the private exponent; it quite often uses the Chinese Remainder Theorem if the CRT parameters are present for a ~4x speedup.\r\n\r\n - OS2IP converts an octet string (or byte array) to an integer by interpreting it as a statically sized unsigned big endian value, I2OSP performs the reverse operation. If the runtime can directly perform big integer calculations on the binary representation then the conversion is implicit (i.e. doesn&#39;t need to be performed at all).\r\n\r\n - The PKCS#1 v1.5 padding used for encryption and signature generation is different, so using encryption may result in erroneous signatures.\r\n\r\n - An alternative verification method is to extract the hash from the padding and perform a compare of the hash values.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## PKCS#1 v1.5 for iOS ##\r\n\r\nWith regards to the padding in iOS, please check [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5066573/589259) by Thomas Pornin.

If ZIP and JAR files are pretty much the same why is there a need for two different libraries?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","wear-os"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":27995136,"reputation":1,"user_id":21380557,"display_name":"Mike"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1678599702,"creation_date":1678599702,"answer_id":75711253,"question_id":75710297,"body_markdown":"Confirming this code works on WearOS 3.5.
