You are using the wrong index to print the word. Here is your code for method `collectWords`:\r\n```java\r\nprivate String[] collectWords(FileResource fr) {\r\n    int nWords = countWordsInFile(fr);\r\n    String[] fileWords = new String[nWords + 1];\r\n    int i = 0;\r\n    for (String s : fr.words()) {\r\n        fileWords[i] = s;\r\n        i++;\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;fileWords: &quot; + i + &quot; word: &quot; + fileWords[i]);\r\n    }\r\n    return fileWords;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn the first iteration of the `for` loop, the value of `i` is 0 (zero). You store a word in array `fileWords` at index 0. Then you increment the index so the value of `i` is now 1 (one). The element in `fileWords` at index 1 is [still] null.

Have an extra flag in your entity definition, and update it on Delete.\n\n    In this case you need to be careful, and rewrite all existing queries, to be sure, that removed entities would not be returned, and keep in mind this separation of results, for all future entities.

This scope will call the initialization each time the bean is requested.\r\nAs you can see from the code, this suits our case very well since calling again the method to initialize will also get the new configured database connection details.\r\nThere are some caveats to using Prototype.\r\nMore info about the scopes can be found in the docs: https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.0.0.M3/reference/html/ch04s04.html\r\n\r\nHere’s the code the Repository as well:\r\n\r\n    @Lazy\r\n    @Repository\r\n    @ComponentScan(basePackages = „com.cli.jdbc.datasource“)\r\n    public class CustomRepository{\r\n    \r\n        @Qualifier(„customJdbcTemplate“)\r\n        @Autowired\r\n        private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;\r\n    \r\n    //Implement methods here\r\n\r\nSo we’ve configured the DataSource by reading from our custom Configuration file which changes dynamically at runtime.\r\nNow, when the Settings are changed, we need a way to reinitialize the data source.\r\nConceptually this is done by simply retrieving the DataSource bean from the Spring Context. Because we used Prototype scope, this will cause the logic in the above defined method to be called again which in turn will take the newest changes for our database. After this step, we need to retrieve the jdbcTemplate from the context as well and set this new DataSource to it.\r\n\r\nThe code looks like this:\r\n\r\n    public void refreshCustomJdbc() {\r\n            DataSource ds = (DataSource) getSpringContext().getBean(„customDataSource“);\r\n            JdbcTemplate customJdbcTemplate = (JdbcTemplate) getSpringContext().getBean(„customJdbcTemplate“);\r\n            customJdbcTemplate.setDataSource(ds);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\nReference:\r\nhttps://blog.virtual7.de/dynamically-change-data-source-connection-details-at-runtime-in-spring-boot/\r\n\r\n","title":"How to add new Datasource at runtime Spring Boot","body":"<p>There are plenty of resources explaining how to configure data source in Spring Boot using various options and various ways to retrieve the configuration details of the connections (from external file, from application.properties, hard-coded, etc).\nOn the other hand, if you already have a data source configured and at runtime you want to change the details of this connection (perhaps hostname of database changes) without restarting the application, the information is a bit scarcer.</p>\n<p>The use-case I am talking about is a situation where the user is allowed to change all or part of the connection details to the database (hostname for example).\nThe user has a Settings page where he can edit these details.

This scope will call the initialization each time the bean is requested.\nAs you can see from the code, this suits our case very well since calling again the method to initialize will also get the new configured database connection details.\nThere are some caveats to using Prototype.\nMore info about the scopes can be found in the docs: <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.0.0.M3/reference/html/ch04s04.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.0.0.M3/reference/html/ch04s04.html</a></p>\n<p>Here’s the code the Repository as well:</p>\n<pre><code>@Lazy\n@Repository\n@ComponentScan(basePackages = „com.cli.jdbc.datasource“)\npublic class CustomRepository{\n\n    @Qualifier(„customJdbcTemplate“)\n    @Autowired\n    private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;\n\n//Implement methods here\n</code></pre>\n<p>So we’ve configured the DataSource by reading from our custom Configuration file which changes dynamically at runtime.\nNow, when the Settings are changed, we need a way to reinitialize the data source.\nConceptually this is done by simply retrieving the DataSource bean from the Spring Context. Because we used Prototype scope, this will cause the logic in the above defined method to be called again which in turn will take the newest changes for our database. After this step, we need to retrieve the jdbcTemplate from the context as well and set this new DataSource to it.</p>\n<p>The code looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>public void refreshCustomJdbc() {\n        DataSource ds = (DataSource) getSpringContext().getBean(„customDataSource“);\n        JdbcTemplate customJdbcTemplate = (JdbcTemplate) getSpringContext().getBean(„customJdbcTemplate“);\n        customJdbcTemplate.setDataSource(ds);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Reference:\n<a href=\"https://blog.virtual7.de/dynamically-change-data-source-connection-details-at-runtime-in-spring-boot/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://blog.virtual7.de/dynamically-change-data-source-connection-details-at-runtime-in-spring-boot/</a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":14573336,"reputation":135,"user_id":10525983,"display_name":"Juan David"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":3089,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"answer_count":2,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1651305030,"creation_date":1549557868,"question_id":54578227,"body_markdown":"I have this, but I don&#39;t find any possible solution.

For example, if both the user A and the super-user B tried the very same search parameters (even the very same url), the user B would get all of user A&#39;s files and then some more.

Here is what I come up with:</p>\n<pre><code>public class TreeNode {\n    int val;\n    TreeNode left;\n    TreeNode right;\n    public TreeNode() {}\n    public TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }\n    public TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {\n        this.val = val;\n        this.left = left;\n        this.right = right;\n    }\n}\n\npublic static int maxDepthDfs(TreeNode root){\n    Deque&lt;TreeNode&gt; stack = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();\n    Deque&lt;Integer&gt; depths = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();\n    TreeNode current = root;\n    int maxDepth = 0;\n    int currentDepth = 0;\n    while(!stack.isEmpty() || current != null){\n        if(current == null){\n            if(currentDepth &gt; maxDepth){\n                maxDepth = currentDepth;\n            }\n            current = stack.pop().right;\n            currentDepth = depths.pop() + 1;\n        } else {\n            stack.push(current);\n            current = current.left;\n            depths.push(currentDepth);\n            currentDepth++;\n        }\n    }\n    return maxDepth;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The problem about this solution is that there are to much of extra space.

So, in the JIT-compiled code, getting a reference to the current thread is just a single load from a structure pointed by a dedicated register.</p>\n<p>E.g. on x64 the register R15 holds a pointer to the current VM thread while executing Java code, and <code>Thread.currentThread()</code> call is compiled to something like</p>\n<pre><code>  mov  0x280(%r15),%r11\n</code></pre>\n<p>Therefore calling <code>Thread.currentThread()</code> is not slower than reading a regular field, and should not be a performance issue.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":11900174,"reputation":380,"user_id":9193035,"display_name":"Husker"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":579,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":72064966,"answer_count":1,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1651280783,"creation_date":1650989660,"question_id":72017226,"body_markdown":"I have Runnable queue that invokes one by one in specified thread.\r\n```kotlin\r\nval queue = LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;() -&gt; Unit&gt;()\r\n\r\nval queueThread = thread {\r\n  while(true)\r\n    queue.take().invoke()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso I have function that adds Runnable and wait for it to complete.\r\n```kotlin\r\nfun invokeOnQueueThread(toInvoke: () -&gt; Unit){\r\n  if(Thread.currentThread() == queueThread)\r\n    toInvoke()\r\n  else {\r\n    queue.offer(toInvoke)\r\n    // Some waiting code...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI test if current thread is already inside my queue&#39;s thread to prevent unnecessary locking itself.\r\n\r\nSo, the question is:\r\n\r\nWill ```Thread.currentThread()``` cause performance issues if I call this code very, very often?","title":"Thread.currentThread() performance","body":"<p>I have Runnable queue that invokes one by one in specified thread.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-kotlin prettyprint-override\"><code>val queue = LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;() -&gt; Unit&gt;()\n\nval queueThread = thread {\n  while(true)\n    queue.take().invoke()\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also I have function that adds Runnable and wait for it to complete.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-kotlin prettyprint-override\"><code>fun invokeOnQueueThread(toInvoke: () -&gt; Unit){\n  if(Thread.currentThread() == queueThread)\n    toInvoke()\n  else {\n    queue.offer(toInvoke)\n    // Some waiting code...\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I test if current thread is already inside my queue's thread to prevent unnecessary locking itself.</p>\n<p>So, the question is:</p>\n<p>Will <code>Thread.currentThread()</code> cause performance issues if I call this code very, very often?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","multithreading","scheduledexecutorservice"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":322981,"reputation":310745,"user_id":642706,"accept_rate":58,"display_name":"Basil Bourque"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1651280447,"creation_date":1651247793,"answer_id":72060674,"question_id":72058102,"body_markdown":"# Just use the main thread\r\n\r\nIf your app has nothing else to do, then why use an executor service?
