Playing around with the low level `CT*` classes is very complex and error prone.\r\n\r\nUsing line charts I have provided an example already here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63245147/second-line-in-an-apache-poi-chart-with-seperate-axis/63246879#63246879.\r\n\r\nBut using bar charts there is an additional problem to solve. If one bar chart series is on primary axis and another is on secondary axis, then the bars will overlap each other. This is because each of the series are oriented only on those series using the same axis. In other words the series on primary axis do not respect the series on the secondary axis when it comes to taking space on the chart. For line charts this is not a problem but for bar charts it is.\r\n\r\nTo solve this additional series having dummy data (all 0) can be used on both the axes. Those additional series lead to invisible bars (height 0) which also take space and so can be used to shift the visible bars.\r\n\r\nThe following complete example shows this.

The pad series are needed to shift the visible bar series and to determine the bar width of them. So if you have two visible bar series on the first chart which uses the left axis and one visible bar series on the second chart which uses the right axis, then you need one additional pad series as the last series in the first bar chart and you need two pad series as the first series in the second bar chart.

It isn&#39;t valid because you haven&#39;t specified the name of the address that the queue will be bound to. The broker should log something like this when it comes up indicating that the configuration isn&#39;t valid:\r\n```\r\nWARN  [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.server] AMQ222275: Failed to deploy queue &lt;queue name&gt;: null\r\n```\r\nAs noted in the [JMS-to-core mapping documentation][1], a JMS queue is a core address and an *anycast* core queue with the same name. Therefore, you should be using a configuration like this instead:\r\n```java\r\ncoreQueueConfiguration.setAddress(&quot;Queue123&quot;).setName(&quot;Queue123&quot;).setDurable(true).setRoutingType(org.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.RoutingType.ANYCAST);\r\n```\r\nMy guess is that things are partially working because by default the core JMS client will auto-create the destinations that it needs so whatever you configure in your JNDI properties will get automatically created regardless of the `CoreQueueConfiguration` you&#39;ve specified. If you don&#39;t want to auto-create the underlying addresses and queues required for JMS destinations then you should disable this using the corresponding address settings. There are also settings to auto-delete addresses and queues when they are no longer used (i.e. when the message-count = 0 &amp; counsumer-count = 0) which you&#39;d probably want to disable as well. Here&#39;s an example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nserver.getAddressSettingsRepository().addMatch(&quot;#&quot;, new AddressSettings()\r\n   .setAutoCreateQueues(false)\r\n   .setAutoDeleteQueues(false)\r\n   .setAutoCreateAddresses(false)\r\n   .setAutoDeleteAddresses(false));\r\n```\r\nSecond, JNDI configuration is explained in [this bit of documentation][2]:\r\n\r\n&gt; JMS destinations are also typically looked up via JNDI. As with connection factories, destinations can be configured using special properties in the JNDI context environment. The property *name* should follow the pattern: `queue.&lt;jndi-binding&gt;` or `topic.&lt;jndi-binding&gt;`. The property *value* should be the name of the queue hosted by the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server.\r\n\r\nThis explains why you need this line:\r\n```java\r\njndi.put(&quot;queue.queue/Queue123&quot;, &quot;Queue123&quot;);\r\n```\r\n[The documentation][2] also states:\r\n&gt; It is also possible to look-up JMS destinations which haven&#39;t been configured explicitly in the JNDI context environment. This is possible using `dynamicQueues/` or `dynamicTopics/` in the look-up string. For example, if the client wanted to look-up the aforementioned &quot;OrderQueue&quot; it could do so simply by using the string &quot;dynamicQueues/OrderQueue&quot;. Note, the text that follows `dynamicQueues/` or `dynamicTopics/` must correspond exactly to the name of the destination on the server.\r\n\r\nThis means that you could leave out the aforementioned line and use this kind of lookup instead:\r\n```java\r\nQueue jmsQueue = (Queue) initialContext.lookup(&quot;dynamicQueues/Queue123&quot;);\r\n```\r\nThat said, it&#39;s not clear why you would use JNDI here at all versus simply instantiating the destination with the JMS API. You could simplify that code substantially by removing all the JNDI code, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory(&quot;vm://0&quot;);\r\n\r\ntry (Connection connection = connectionFactory.createConnection(); \r\n     Session jmsSession = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE)) {\r\n   MessageProducer producer = jmsSession.createProducer(jmsSession.createQueue(&quot;Queue123&quot;));\r\n   connection.start();\r\n   TextMessage message = jmsSession.createTextMessage(&quot;Hello, Artemis!&quot;);\r\n   producer.send(message);\r\n   System.out.println(&quot;Message sent: &quot; + message.getText());\r\n} catch (Exception ex) {\r\n   ex.printStackTrace();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTo get the control for the queue use something like this:\r\n```\r\nQueueControl coreQueueControl = (QueueControl) server.getManagementService().getResource(org.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.management.ResourceNames.QUEUE + &quot;Queue123&quot;);\r\n```\r\nTo browse the queue you can use a [`javax.jms.QueueBrowser`][3]. There&#39;s lots of tutorials on the web for that.\r\n\r\nLastly, the decision to deprecate the JMS configuration and management bits was made before version 2.0.0 was released after we added support for AMQP, MQTT, and OpenWire. At that point it made sense to simplify the config and management down to just core resources (i.e. addresses, queues, and routing-types). Having all the core stuff *plus* corresponding config and management for JMS would have certainly caused confusion for users and would have also been hard to maintain. We spent a fair amount of time updating the documentation to explain how everything maps from the various  supported protocols and APIs down to the core resources.

Here's an example:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>server.getAddressSettingsRepository().addMatch(\"#\", new AddressSettings()\n   .setAutoCreateQueues(false)\n   .setAutoDeleteQueues(false)\n   .setAutoCreateAddresses(false)\n   .setAutoDeleteAddresses(false));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Second, JNDI configuration is explained in <a href=\"http://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/using-jms.html#jndi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this bit of documentation</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>JMS destinations are also typically looked up via JNDI. As with connection factories, destinations can be configured using special properties in the JNDI context environment. The property <em>name</em> should follow the pattern: <code>queue.&lt;jndi-binding&gt;</code> or <code>topic.&lt;jndi-binding&gt;</code>. The property <em>value</em> should be the name of the queue hosted by the Apache ActiveMQ Artemis server.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This explains why you need this line:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>jndi.put(\"queue.queue/Queue123\", \"Queue123\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/using-jms.html#jndi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The documentation</a> also states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is also possible to look-up JMS destinations which haven't been configured explicitly in the JNDI context environment. This is possible using <code>dynamicQueues/</code> or <code>dynamicTopics/</code> in the look-up string. For example, if the client wanted to look-up the aforementioned \"OrderQueue\" it could do so simply by using the string \"dynamicQueues/OrderQueue\". Note, the text that follows <code>dynamicQueues/</code> or <code>dynamicTopics/</code> must correspond exactly to the name of the destination on the server.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This means that you could leave out the aforementioned line and use this kind of lookup instead:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>Queue jmsQueue = (Queue) initialContext.lookup(\"dynamicQueues/Queue123\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That said, it's not clear why you would use JNDI here at all versus simply instantiating the destination with the JMS API. You could simplify that code substantially by removing all the JNDI code, e.g.:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory(\"vm://0\");\n\ntry (Connection connection = connectionFactory.createConnection(); \n     Session jmsSession = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE)) {\n   MessageProducer producer = jmsSession.createProducer(jmsSession.createQueue(\"Queue123\"));\n   connection.start();\n   TextMessage message = jmsSession.createTextMessage(\"Hello, Artemis!\");\n   producer.send(message);\n   System.out.println(\"Message sent: \" + message.getText());\n} catch (Exception ex) {\n   ex.printStackTrace();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To get the control for the queue use something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>QueueControl coreQueueControl = (QueueControl) server.getManagementService().getResource(org.apache.activemq.artemis.api.core.management.ResourceNames.QUEUE + \"Queue123\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To browse the queue you can use a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/jms/QueueBrowser.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>javax.jms.QueueBrowser</code></a>. There's lots of tutorials on the web for that.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, the decision to deprecate the JMS configuration and management bits was made before version 2.0.0 was released after we added support for AMQP, MQTT, and OpenWire. At that point it made sense to simplify the config and management down to just core resources (i.e. addresses, queues, and routing-types). Having all the core stuff <em>plus</em> corresponding config and management for JMS would have certainly caused confusion for users and would have also been hard to maintain. We spent a fair amount of time updating the documentation to explain how everything maps from the various  supported protocols and APIs down to the core resources. <a href=\"http://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/address-model.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This document</a> provides an overview you may find helpful.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":152350,"reputation":5455,"user_id":366816,"accept_rate":18,"display_name":"ipolevoy"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1584728835,"creation_date":1584728835,"answer_id":60779726,"question_id":60747639,"body_markdown":"additional detail: \r\n\r\nConfigure the queue: \r\n\r\n    CoreQueueConfiguration coreQueueConfiguration = new CoreQueueConfiguration();\r\n    coreQueueConfiguration.setAddress(QUEUE_NAME).setName(QUEUE_NAME).setDurable(true).setRoutingType(RoutingType.ANYCAST);\r\n    configuration.addQueueConfiguration(coreQueueConfiguration);\r\n\r\nthe way to register the queue name: \r\n\r\n    jndi.put(&quot;queue.queue/&quot; + QUEUE_NAME, QUEUE_NAME);\r\n\r\nThe way to configure the broker: \r\n\r\n    server.getActiveMQServer().getAddressSettingsRepository().addMatch(&quot;#&quot;, new AddressSettings()\r\n                    .setAutoCreateQueues(false)\r\n                    .setAutoCreateAddresses(false)\r\n                    .setAutoDeleteQueues(false)\r\n                    .setAutoDeleteAddresses(false));\r\n\r\n\r\nA full working example: https://github.com/ipolevoy/artemis-sanbox/blob/7e2194788ec4e825d4219f06ebbaa9b9195e2b30/src/main/java/examples/JMSExampleJNDI_GUI.java#L23","title":"How to create Apache Artemis queues in code and use them with JMS?","body":"<p>additional detail: </p>\n\n<p>Configure the queue: </p>\n\n<pre><code>CoreQueueConfiguration coreQueueConfiguration = new CoreQueueConfiguration();\ncoreQueueConfiguration.setAddress(QUEUE_NAME).setName(QUEUE_NAME).setDurable(true).setRoutingType(RoutingType.ANYCAST);\nconfiguration.addQueueConfiguration(coreQueueConfiguration);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>the way to register the queue name: </p>\n\n<pre><code>jndi.put(\"queue.queue/\" + QUEUE_NAME, QUEUE_NAME);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The way to configure the broker: </p>\n\n<pre><code>server.getActiveMQServer().getAddressSettingsRepository().addMatch(\"#\", new AddressSettings()\n                .setAutoCreateQueues(false)\n                .setAutoCreateAddresses(false)\n                .setAutoDeleteQueues(false)\n                .setAutoDeleteAddresses(false));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A full working example: <a href=\"https://github.com/ipolevoy/artemis-sanbox/blob/7e2194788ec4e825d4219f06ebbaa9b9195e2b30/src/main/java/examples/JMSExampleJNDI_GUI.java#L23\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/ipolevoy/artemis-sanbox/blob/7e2194788ec4e825d4219f06ebbaa9b9195e2b30/src/main/java/examples/JMSExampleJNDI_GUI.java#L23</a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":152350,"reputation":5455,"user_id":366816,"accept_rate":18,"display_name":"ipolevoy"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":5062,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":60749623,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1640910158,"creation_date":1584566382,"question_id":60747639,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m migrating the [JavaLite Async][1] from Artemis 2.3.0 to 2.11.0 version.

Here&#39;s an example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport java.io.*;\r\n\r\ntry {\r\n    String cmd = &quot;git clone https://github.com/account/repo.git&quot;;\r\n    Process p = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd);\r\n}\r\ncatch(IOException e)\r\n{\r\n   System.err.println(&quot;Exception occurred while executing command.&quot;);\r\n   e.printStackTrace();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional References:**\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4193277/looking-for-decent-git-libraries-for-java\r\n- https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JGit/article.html\r\n- https://www.codeaffine.com/2014/12/09/jgit-authentication/\r\n- https://github.com/centic9/jgit-cookbook/\r\n- https://www.infoworld.com/article/2071275/when-runtime-exec---won-t.html\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/\r\n  [2]: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.jgit/org.eclipse.jgit\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html","title":"How can we use/access/read file contents of files placed in a private gitlab repository in our java code","body":"<p>If the purpose of your Java application is to analyze/control git repositories, then it would make sense to perform the git operations in the JAR.

This makes it a lot easier to do things like rotation.....\r\n\r\n    g2d.translate(50 * cellWidth, 50 * cellHeight);\r\n\r\nThen you can rotate the context around the centre point of the cell (remember, `0x0` is now our cell offset)...\r\n\r\n    g2d.rotate(Math.toRadians(90), cellWidth / 2, cellWidth / 2);\r\n\r\nAnd then we can simply draw the image...\r\n\r\n    g2d.drawImage(image, 0, 0, cellWidth, cellHeight, Color.WHITE, null);\r\n\r\nAnd don&#39;t forget to dispose of the copy when you&#39;re done\r\n\r\n    g2d.dispose();\r\n\r\nYou might also want to take a look at The [2D Graphics trail](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/index.html), as you could use a `AffineTransformation` instead, but it&#39;d be accomplishing the same thing, more or less\r\n\r\n&gt; Is there a way to actually see the rotating happening (so see the rotation &quot;live&quot;)?\r\n\r\nAnimation is a complex subject, add in the fact that Swing is single threaded and not thread safe and you need to think carefully about it.\r\n\r\nHave a look at [Concurrency in Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html) and [How to Use Swing Timers](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/timer.html) for more details.\r\n\r\n# Simple animation\r\n\r\nThe following example makes use of simple Swing `Timer` to rotate a image when it&#39;s clicked.

For example, if you want to have multiple images rotate.  Towards that end, you will need to keep track of some kind of model for each image which contains the required information to calculate the current rotation value.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is, what happens if you want to compound the animation?  That is, scale and rotate the animation at the same time.\r\n\r\nTowards this end, I&#39;d lean towards using concepts like &quot;time lines&quot; and &quot;key frames&quot;\r\n\r\nThe following example is based on my personal library [Super Simple Swing Animation Framework](https://github.com/RustyKnight/SuperSimpleSwingAnimationFramework). This is bit more of a playground for me then a fully fledged animation framework, but it embodies many of the core concepts which help make animating in Swing simpler and help produce a much nicer result\r\n\r\n\r\n    import java.awt.Dimension;\r\n    import java.awt.EventQueue;\r\n    import java.awt.Graphics;\r\n    import java.awt.Graphics2D;\r\n    import java.awt.event.MouseAdapter;\r\n    import java.awt.event.MouseEvent;\r\n    import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;\r\n    import java.io.IOException;\r\n    import java.time.Duration;\r\n    import java.util.ArrayList;\r\n    import java.util.HashMap;\r\n    import java.util.List;\r\n    import java.util.Map;\r\n    import java.util.logging.Level;\r\n    import java.util.logging.Logger;\r\n    import javax.imageio.ImageIO;\r\n    import javax.swing.JFrame;\r\n    import javax.swing.JPanel;\r\n    import org.kaizen.animation.Animatable;\r\n    import org.kaizen.animation.AnimatableAdapter;\r\n    import org.kaizen.animation.AnimatableDuration;\r\n    import org.kaizen.animation.DefaultAnimatableDuration;\r\n    import org.kaizen.animation.curves.Curves;\r\n    import org.kaizen.animation.timeline.BlendingTimeLine;\r\n    import org.kaizen.animation.timeline.DoubleBlender;\r\n\r\n    public class Advanced {\r\n\r\n        public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\r\n            new Advanced();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public Advanced() {\r\n            EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public void run() {\r\n                    try {\r\n                        JFrame frame = new JFrame();\r\n                        frame.add(new TestPane());\r\n                        frame.pack();\r\n                        frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\r\n                        frame.setVisible(true);\r\n                    } catch (IOException ex) {\r\n                        Logger.getLogger(Advanced.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public class TestPane extends JPanel {\r\n\r\n            private List&lt;BufferedImage&gt; images;\r\n\r\n            private Map&lt;BufferedImage, Double&gt; imageZoom = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n            private Map&lt;BufferedImage, Double&gt; imageRotate = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n            private BlendingTimeLine&lt;Double&gt; zoomTimeLine;\r\n            private BlendingTimeLine&lt;Double&gt; rotateTimeLine;\r\n\r\n            public TestPane() throws IOException {\r\n\r\n                zoomTimeLine = new BlendingTimeLine&lt;&gt;(new DoubleBlender());\r\n                zoomTimeLine.addKeyFrame(0, 1.0);\r\n                zoomTimeLine.addKeyFrame(0.25, 1.5);\r\n                zoomTimeLine.addKeyFrame(0.75, 1.5);\r\n                zoomTimeLine.addKeyFrame(1.0, 1.0);\r\n\r\n                rotateTimeLine = new BlendingTimeLine&lt;&gt;(new DoubleBlender());\r\n                rotateTimeLine.addKeyFrame(0d, 0d);\r\n                rotateTimeLine.addKeyFrame(0.1, 0d);\r\n    //            rotateTimeLine.addKeyFrame(0.85, 360.0 * 4d);\r\n                rotateTimeLine.addKeyFrame(1.0, 360.0 * 4d);\r\n\r\n                images = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(9);\r\n                for (int index = 0; index &lt; 9; index++) {\r\n                    BufferedImage img = ImageIO.read(getClass().getResource(&quot;/images/p&quot; + (index + 1) + &quot;.png&quot;));\r\n                    images.add(img);\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {\r\n                    @Override\r\n                    public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {\r\n                        int col = (e.getX() -

For example, if you want to have multiple images rotate.  Towards that end, you will need to keep track of some kind of model for each image which contains the required information to calculate the current rotation value.</p>\n<p>Another issue is, what happens if you want to compound the animation?  That is, scale and rotate the animation at the same time.</p>\n<p>Towards this end, I'd lean towards using concepts like &quot;time lines&quot; and &quot;key frames&quot;</p>\n<p>The following example is based on my personal library <a href=\"https://github.com/RustyKnight/SuperSimpleSwingAnimationFramework\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Super Simple Swing Animation Framework</a>.
