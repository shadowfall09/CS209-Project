Any help is appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","geometry","javafx"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":483434,"reputation":25487,"user_id":898478,"accept_rate":86,"display_name":"m0skit0"},"score":0,"creation_date":1384707791,"post_id":20033512,"comment_id":29834664,"body_markdown":"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3851520/basic-2d-collision-detection","body":"<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3851520/basic-2d-collision-detection\" title=\"basic 2d collision detection\">stackoverflow.com/questions/3851520/&hellip;</a>"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1299356,"reputation":1264,"user_id":2312686,"accept_rate":90,"display_name":"matovitch"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1384723885,"creation_date":1384723885,"answer_id":20036434,"question_id":20033512,"body_markdown":"I don&#39;t know JavaFx but here is the idea :\r\n\r\n    while (1) {\r\n        bool btop = pos.y &gt;= top\r\n        bool bbottom = pos.y &lt;= bottom\r\n        bool bleft = pos.x &lt;= left\r\n        bool bright = pos.x &gt;= right\r\n        bool rect_btop = pos.y &lt;= rect_top &amp;&amp;

code, and when the XML is read, I see a difference between Jboss version and Wildly version.\r\n\r\nJboss version with a &quot;UnifiedClassLoader&quot; has dozen of &quot;packages&quot; loaded in it (included spring-beans and others things) :\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nWildfly version with a &quot;ModuleClassLoader&quot; has only 2 packages, and not the spring-beans jar :\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a problem with my two files for my App : 1 war and 1 .ear file.\r\n\r\nThe .ear file is not loaded like Jboss, and miss the spring dependencies.\r\n\r\nBut why in the stack trace we see &quot;spring-beans-4.0.6.RELEASE.jar&quot; mentioned in this case ?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/UwE9o.jpg\r\n  [2]:

If you use JSSE&#39;s default TrustManager it always uses that type of file, though you can specify a different file name, and if you use JSSE&#39;s default TrustManager _implementations_ obtained from `TrustManagerFactory` they go one level higher by taking a `KeyStore` object containing/providing root certs -- which you can have created using something other than a file.\r\n\r\nWhen JSSE needs to validate a cert-chain for a handshake, SSLSocketImpl (or SSLEngineImpl) doesn&#39;t do so directly but calls the TrustManager which was set from the factory and context (default or other), and [the above default](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk11/file/1ddf9a99e4ad/src/java.base/share/classes/sun/security/ssl/X509TrustManagerImpl.java) first calls `checkTrustedInit` which (once) calls [sun.security.validator.Validator.getInstance](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk11/file/1ddf9a99e4ad/src/java.base/share/classes/sun/security/validator/Validator.java) to create either [SimpleValidator](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk11/file/1ddf9a99e4ad/src/java.base/share/classes/sun/security/validator/SimpleValidator.java) or [PKIXValidator](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk11/file/1ddf9a99e4ad/src/java.base/share/classes/sun/security/validator/PKIXValidator.java) which is then used to validate the cert-chain. The former (now considered obsolete but still in the code) directly implements a simpler/earlier version of the validation algorithm, and as you can see for the anchor/root at `chain[chain.length-1]` it does almost no checks before turning it into a [`sun.security.cert.TrustAnchor`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/security/cert/TrustAnchor.html) which is used to check the lower certs. The latter (now default) is more complicated and uses the `CertPathValidator` (and possibly `CertPathBuilder`) API(s), which end up doing the same thing.\r\n\r\nIf you want you can substitute your own TrustManager implementation which implements the standard differently (perhaps including checking validity period on the anchor cert) or even not at all (in which case of course the security of connections you make depends on what you implement).\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s Encrypt actually makes use of behavior like this to [support old versions of Android](https://letsencrypt.org/2020/12/21/extending-android-compatibility.html) that don&#39;t have LE&#39;s own root cert &#39;ISRG Root X1&#39; because they predate 2015-ish, and can&#39;t be updated usually because the manufacturer stopped supporting them or even stopped existing. Although they describe this only for Android, it actually works for Java also -- where it shouldn&#39;t be needed because most uses of Java, except maybe the embedded/card version ME, can be and are updated or at least the truststore maintained. \r\n\r\nYou can demonstrate this by running the below code to read in the expired DST-X3 root cert and use only it, and not the ISRG-X1 root that people normally should use, to validate a connection to a site that uses a LetsEncrypt cert with the &#39;compatibility&#39; chain -- StackExchange itself including stackoverflow.com is such a site at least for now. You can&#39;t get DST-X3 from a current Java, where it has been deleted precisely because it is expired and should not be used (and of course _deleting_ it does cause cert chains using it to fail validation!) or most other systems/devices if current. If you use an _Oracle_ Java package older than last fall, it does have the DST-X3 cert; if you use an older OpenJDK it _may_ use a private cacerts that does have DST-X3 but depending on which builder&#39;s package you use it may instead use an external (platform) truststore that is updated to remove DST-X3 even though Java itself is not updated. You can also get DST-X3 [from LetsEncrypt or Identrust directly](https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/) or from public repositories such as [this one](https://crt.sh/?id=8395) (also linked by LetsEncrypt). \r\n\r\n\t\t// file_containing_CAcert(e.g. DSTX3) hostname [port]\r\n\t\tX509Certificate c;\r\n\t\ttry( InputStream is = new FileInputStream (args[0])) {\r\n\t\t\tc = (X509Certificate) CertificateFactory.getInstance(&quot;X.509&quot;).generateCertificate(is);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println (c.getNotAfter()+&quot; &quot;+c.getSubjectDN());\r\n\t\tKeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(&quot;PKCS12&quot;); // any file-based\r\n\t\tks.load(null); ks.setCertificateEntry(&quot;test&quot;, c);\r\n\t\tTrustManagerFactory tmf = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(&quot;PKIX&quot;);\r\n\t\ttmf.init(ks);\r\n\t\tSSLContext ctx = SSLContext.getInstance(&quot;TLS&quot;);\r\n\t\tctx.init(null,  tmf.getTrustManagers(), null);\r\n\t\tSSLSocket s = (SSLSocket) ctx.getSocketFactory().createSocket(args[1], args.length&gt;2?

The latter (now default) is more complicated and uses the <code>CertPathValidator</code> (and possibly <code>CertPathBuilder</code>) API(s), which end up doing the same thing.</p>\n<p>If you want you can substitute your own TrustManager implementation which implements the standard differently (perhaps including checking validity period on the anchor cert) or even not at all (in which case of course the security of connections you make depends on what you implement).</p>\n<p>Let's Encrypt actually makes use of behavior like this to <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/2020/12/21/extending-android-compatibility.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">support old versions of Android</a> that don't have LE's own root cert 'ISRG Root X1' because they predate 2015-ish, and can't be updated usually because the manufacturer stopped supporting them or even stopped existing. Although they describe this only for Android, it actually works for Java also -- where it shouldn't be needed because most uses of Java, except maybe the embedded/card version ME, can be and are updated or at least the truststore maintained.</p>\n<p>You can demonstrate this by running the below code to read in the expired DST-X3 root cert and use only it, and not the ISRG-X1 root that people normally should use, to validate a connection to a site that uses a LetsEncrypt cert with the 'compatibility' chain -- StackExchange itself including stackoverflow.com is such a site at least for now. You can't get DST-X3 from a current Java, where it has been deleted precisely because it is expired and should not be used (and of course <em>deleting</em> it does cause cert chains using it to fail validation!) or most other systems/devices if current. If you use an <em>Oracle</em> Java package older than last fall, it does have the DST-X3 cert; if you use an older OpenJDK it <em>may</em> use a private cacerts that does have DST-X3 but depending on which builder's package you use it may instead use an external (platform) truststore that is updated to remove DST-X3 even though Java itself is not updated. You can also get DST-X3 <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">from LetsEncrypt or Identrust directly</a> or from public repositories such as <a href=\"https://crt.sh/?id=8395\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this one</a> (also linked by LetsEncrypt).</p>\n<pre><code>    // file_containing_CAcert(e.g. DSTX3) hostname [port]\n    X509Certificate c;\n    try( InputStream is = new FileInputStream (args[0])) {\n        c = (X509Certificate) CertificateFactory.getInstance(&quot;X.509&quot;).generateCertificate(is);\n    }\n    System.out.println (c.getNotAfter()+&quot; &quot;+c.getSubjectDN());\n    KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(&quot;PKCS12&quot;); // any file-based\n    ks.load(null); ks.setCertificateEntry(&quot;test&quot;, c);\n    TrustManagerFactory tmf = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(&quot;PKIX&quot;);\n    tmf.init(ks);\n    SSLContext ctx = SSLContext.getInstance(&quot;TLS&quot;);\n    ctx.init(null,  tmf.getTrustManagers(), null);\n    SSLSocket s = (SSLSocket) ctx.getSocketFactory().createSocket(args[1], args.length&gt;2?

My array is:</p>\n<pre><code>    public void makeCharacters() {\n    characters = new Array&lt;Characters&gt;();\n    characters.add(new Characters(new Sprite(new Texture(&quot;img1.png&quot;)), spawn));\n    characters.add(new Characters(new Sprite(new Texture(&quot;img2.png&quot;)), spawn));\n    characters.add(new Characters(new Sprite(new Texture(&quot;img3.png&quot;)), spawn));\n    characters.add(new Characters(new Sprite(new Texture(&quot;img4.png&quot;)), spawn));\n    characters.add(new Characters(new Sprite(new Texture(&quot;img5png&quot;)), spawn));\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","regex","string","impala"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1021725,"reputation":10018,"user_id":1031887,"accept_rate":77,"display_name":"phatfingers"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1656516581,"creation_date":1656516581,"answer_id":72804087,"question_id":72802750,"body_markdown":"You could key the pattern off of a word immediately preceding one of a set of known data types.

We can **not** reject any combinations on the fly, because we can&#39;t know in advance which of them can be used in the optimal solution. For instance, if `target` is `6` and a list of number is `[3,3,2,2,1,1]`, there will be the following combinations: `[3,3]`, `[2,2,1,1]` and `[3,2,1]` appear two times. If we pick `[3,3]`, which is the shortest combination, we will not be able to construct any combinations and resulting score will be wrong (`6`). Instead, we need to choose two combinations `[3,2,1]` which well give the result `12`. That proves that we can&#39;t rely on the combination size, we need to explore all the combinations and then choose the optimal set of combinations.\r\n\r\n* Generate all possible groups of combinations that fit to the given list of numbers and find a group having the maximum number of combinations in it.\r\n\r\nIn the code below both steps are implemented recursively.\r\n\r\n[*A link to Online Demo*](https://www.jdoodle.com/ia/sKN)\r\n\r\n*Expalanation:*\r\n\r\nThe enty point, this method that kicks in the process. \r\n\r\n    public static int sumRecursively(List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers, int target) {\r\n        Deque&lt;List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; combinations = new ArrayDeque&lt;&gt;();\r\n        generateCombinations(numbers, combinations, new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(), target);\r\n        \r\n        return processCombinations(combinations, numbers, target);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Step 1**.

I.e. each time we find a combination which sums up to the target number, we should prohibit the usage of elements that have been used in this combination, but not earlier (because there can be many combinations which are not able to produce the target, and therefore any element should eligible to be used until we didn&#39;t construct a complete combination that gives the target using this element).\r\n\r\nTo track the elements that are taken, we need an object that would be visible in every recursive branch. And we are already passing a list of numbers while making every recursive call, what if we would modify it each time we found a combination that produces the target number by removing the elements that have been use in this combination? If we took this road after the first combination, thing would become complicated because we will not be able to rely on the indices (*because they can change in an unpredictable way*) while constructing a single combination - it&#39;s crucial to ensure that each element that belongs to a particular combination is used only once withing a combination. Since values of elements might be identical, we should use the iteration order to construct each combination properly, but each removal of elements would create a mess. So, is there a better way?\r\n\r\nWe can maintain an array of `boolean` values, each element is this array would indicate whether a number at a particular index already belongs to a combination that gives the target or not.\r\n\r\nInstead of clattering the recursive method with the code that manipulates with this `boolean` array, I&#39;ve encapsulated it within a class with simple and self-explanatory methods, and `sumRecursively()` makes use of an instance of this class.\r\n```\r\npublic class CombinationTracker {\r\n    private boolean[] isUsed;\r\n    \r\n    public CombinationTracker(int size) {\r\n        this.isUsed = new boolean[size];\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public boolean indexIsUsed(int ind) {\r\n        return isUsed[ind];\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public boolean allNotUsed(List&lt;Integer&gt; indices) {\r\n//            return indices.stream().noneMatch(i -&gt; isUsed[i]); // this line does the same as the loop below\r\n        \r\n        boolean result = true;\r\n        for (int idx: indices) {\r\n            if (isUsed[idx]) {\r\n                result = false;\r\n                break;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return result;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public void setIsUsed(List&lt;Integer&gt; indices) {\r\n        for (int ind: indices)\r\n            setIsUsed(ind);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public void setIsUsed(int ind) {\r\n        isUsed[ind] = true;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nUsing this approach, we are able to construct combinations from numbers that are not used yet, and iterate over the list of numbers starting from a particular position by passing the index while making a recursive call.  We can be sure that any of the elements that reside prier to the current position would not be added to the current combination.\r\n\r\nNow, a quick recap on *recursion*.\r\n\r\nEvery recursive implementation consists of two parts:\r\n\r\n * **Base case** - that represents an edge-case (*or a set of edge-cases*) for which the outcome is known in advance. For this problem, there are **two** edge-cases: \r\n\r\n      * we&#39;ve managed to find a combination that gives the target number, i.e. `currentSum == target`, and the result would be equal to `target`; \r\n\r\n      * the end of the list is reached (and the combination doesn&#39;t result to the target), the result would be `0` (this edge-case resolves automatically by termination condition of the `for` loop in the *recursive case*, and therefore no need to treat it separately).\r\n\r\n* **Recursive case** - a part of a solution where recursive calls are made and where the main logic resides. In the *recursive case* we&#39;re iterating over the list of numbers and at each iteration step (*if the index is not yet used*) we are making *one* or *two* recursive calls depending on a value of the current element (*depending whether we exceed the target or not*). In the general, we have two opportunities: either take the current element, or ignore it. The results of these recursive calls would be added together and produce the return value of the *recursive case*.\r\n\r\nSince we need a couple of additional parameters, it&#39;s a good practice to create an auxiliary overloaded method (*that will be used in the client code*) which expects *only* a list of numbers and a target value and delegates the actual work to the recursive method.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s how it might look like.\r\n\r\n    public static int sumRecursively(List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers, int target) {\r\n        \r\n        return sumRecursively(new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(numbers),\r\n                              new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(),\r\n                              new CombinationTracker(numbers.size()),\r\n                              0, 0, target);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe actual recursive method:\r\n\r\n    private static int sumRecursively(List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers,\r\n                                      List&lt;Integer&gt; combination,\r\n                                      CombinationTracker tracker,\r\n                                      int currentIndex,\r\n                                      int currentSum, int target) {\r\n        \r\n        if (currentSum == target &amp;&amp; tracker.allNotUsed(combination)) { // base case - a combination has been found\r\n            tracker.setIsUsed(combination);\r\n            return target;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        // recursive case\r\n        int result = 0;\r\n        \r\n        for (int i = currentIndex; i &lt; numbers.size(); i++) {\r\n\r\n            int next = numbers.get(i);\r\n\r\n            if (tracker.indexIsUsed(i)) continue;\r\n            if (currentSum + next &gt; target) continue;\r\n            // there are two opportunities for each number: either use next number, or ignore it\r\n            // add next number\r\n            if (next + currentSum &lt;= target) {\r\n                List&lt;Integer&gt; newCombination = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(combination);\r\n                newCombination.add(i);\r\n                result += sumRecursively(numbers, newCombination, tracker, i + 1, currentSum + next, target);\r\n            }\r\n            // ignore next number\r\n            result += sumRecursively(numbers, new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(combination), tracker, i + 1, currentSum, target);\r\n        }\r\n        return result;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n`main()`\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        System.out.println(sumRecursively(List.of(1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6), 12));\r\n        System.out.println(sumRecursively(List.of(6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6), 12));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n*Output:*\r\n```\r\n12\r\n36\r\n```","title":"Calculate the sum of dices based on target accurately","body":"<h3>Update</h3>\n<p>In order to find the maximum possible score of the list, we maximize the number of <em>non-overlapping combinations</em> that we can construct from it.</p>\n<p>For we need to take the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Find all the possible <em>combinations</em> which produce the <code>target</code> sum.

I.e. each time we find a combination which sums up to the target number, we should prohibit the usage of elements that have been used in this combination, but not earlier (because there can be many combinations which are not able to produce the target, and therefore any element should eligible to be used until we didn't construct a complete combination that gives the target using this element).</p>\n<p>To track the elements that are taken, we need an object that would be visible in every recursive branch. And we are already passing a list of numbers while making every recursive call, what if we would modify it each time we found a combination that produces the target number by removing the elements that have been use in this combination? If we took this road after the first combination, thing would become complicated because we will not be able to rely on the indices (<em>because they can change in an unpredictable way</em>) while constructing a single combination - it's crucial to ensure that each element that belongs to a particular combination is used only once withing a combination. Since values of elements might be identical, we should use the iteration order to construct each combination properly, but each removal of elements would create a mess. So, is there a better way?</p>\n<p>We can maintain an array of <code>boolean</code> values, each element is this array would indicate whether a number at a particular index already belongs to a combination that gives the target or not.</p>\n<p>Instead of clattering the recursive method with the code that manipulates with this <code>boolean</code> array, I've encapsulated it within a class with simple and self-explanatory methods, and <code>sumRecursively()</code> makes use of an instance of this class.</p>\n<pre><code>public class CombinationTracker {\n    private boolean[] isUsed;\n    \n    public CombinationTracker(int size) {\n        this.isUsed = new boolean[size];\n    }\n    \n    public boolean indexIsUsed(int ind) {\n        return isUsed[ind];\n    }\n    \n    public boolean allNotUsed(List&lt;Integer&gt; indices) {\n//            return indices.stream().noneMatch(i -&gt; isUsed[i]); // this line does the same as the loop below\n        \n        boolean result = true;\n        for (int idx: indices) {\n            if (isUsed[idx]) {\n                result = false;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n    \n    public void setIsUsed(List&lt;Integer&gt; indices) {\n        for (int ind: indices)\n            setIsUsed(ind);\n    }\n    \n    public void setIsUsed(int ind) {\n        isUsed[ind] = true;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using this approach, we are able to construct combinations from numbers that are not used yet, and iterate over the list of numbers starting from a particular position by passing the index while making a recursive call.  We can be sure that any of the elements that reside prier to the current position would not be added to the current combination.</p>\n<p>Now, a quick recap on <em>recursion</em>.</p>\n<p>Every recursive implementation consists of two parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Base case</strong> - that represents an edge-case (<em>or a set of edge-cases</em>) for which the outcome is known in advance. For this problem, there are <strong>two</strong> edge-cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>we've managed to find a combination that gives the target number, i.e. <code>currentSum == target</code>, and the result would be equal to <code>target</code>;</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>the end of the list is reached (and the combination doesn't result to the target), the result would be <code>0</code> (this edge-case resolves automatically by termination condition of the <code>for</code> loop in the <em>recursive case</em>, and therefore no need to treat it separately).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Recursive case</strong> - a part of a solution where recursive calls are made and where the main logic resides. In the <em>recursive case</em> we're iterating over the list of numbers and at each iteration step (<em>if the index is not yet used</em>) we are making <em>one</em> or <em>two</em> recursive calls depending on a value of the current element (<em>depending whether we exceed the target or not</em>). In the general, we have two opportunities: either take the current element, or ignore it. The results of these recursive calls would be added together and produce the return value of the <em>recursive case</em>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since we need a couple of additional parameters, it's a good practice to create an auxiliary overloaded method (<em>that will be used in the client code</em>) which expects <em>only</em> a list of numbers and a target value and delegates the actual work to the recursive method.</p>\n<p>That's how it might look like.</p>\n<pre><code>public static int sumRecursively(List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers, int target) {\n    \n    return sumRecursively(new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(numbers),\n                          new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(),\n                          new CombinationTracker(numbers.size()),\n                          0, 0, target);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The actual recursive method:</p>\n<pre><code>private static int sumRecursively(List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers,\n                                  List&lt;Integer&gt; combination,\n                                  CombinationTracker tracker,\n                                  int currentIndex,\n                                  int currentSum, int target) {\n    \n    if (currentSum == target &amp;&amp; tracker.allNotUsed(combination)) { // base case - a combination has been found\n        tracker.setIsUsed(combination);\n        return target;\n    }\n    \n    // recursive case\n    int result = 0;\n    \n    for (int i = currentIndex; i &lt; numbers.size(); i++) {\n\n        int next = numbers.get(i);\n\n        if (tracker.indexIsUsed(i)) continue;\n        if (currentSum + next &gt; target) continue;\n        // there are two opportunities for each number: either use next number, or ignore it\n        // add next number\n        if (next + currentSum &lt;= target) {\n            List&lt;Integer&gt; newCombination = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(combination);\n            newCombination.add(i);\n            result += sumRecursively(numbers, newCombination, tracker, i + 1, currentSum + next, target);\n        }\n        // ignore next number\n        result += sumRecursively(numbers, new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(combination), tracker, i + 1, currentSum, target);\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>main()</code></p>\n<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {\n    System.out.println(sumRecursively(List.of(1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6), 12));\n    System.out.println(sumRecursively(List.of(6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6), 12));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Output:</em></p>\n<pre><code>12\n36\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4181375,"reputation":5091,"user_id":3426309,"display_name":"Andrey B.

Consider if you truly want a map in this case (you typically wouldn&#39;t keep multiple keys for one value, but it&#39;s not _always_ bad).
