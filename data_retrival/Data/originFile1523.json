Since only a number of movies is needed, `counting()` has to be used as a downstream collector to reduce *movie objects* mapped to each actor to a number of these objects.\r\n\r\nWith that will be created an intermediate map of type `Map&lt;String, Map&lt;String, Long&gt;&gt;` that represent the total **count** of movies by **actor** for each **year**.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to create a stream over the *entry set* and *flatten* the nested map (*count of movies by actor*) by wrapping every entry in the map with a new *composed entry* of type `Map.Entry&lt;String, Map.Entry&lt;String, Long&gt;&gt;` that will contain a **year**, **actor&#39;s name** and a **count**.\r\n\r\nAnd the last step is to find the *entry* with the *maximum count*.\r\n\r\nFor that operation`max()` has to applied on the stream.

There is often no direct user interaction.\r\n\r\nA Web service basically is a collection of open protocols that is used to exchange data between applications. The use of open protocols enables Web services to be platform independent. Software that are written in different programming languages and that run on different platforms can use Web services to exchange data over computer networks such as the Internet. In other words, Windows applications can talk to PHP, Java and Perl applications and many others, which in normal circumstances would not be possible.\r\n\r\n&gt; How Do Web Services Work?\r\n\r\nBecause different applications are written in different programming languages, they often cannot communicate with each other. A Web service enables this communication by using a combination of open protocols and standards, chiefly XML, SOAP and WSDL. A Web service uses XML to tag data, SOAP to transfer a message and finally WSDL to describe the availability of services. Let&#39;s take a look at these three main components of a Web service application.\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nThe Simple Object Access Protocol or SOAP is a protocol for sending and receiving messages between applications without confronting interoperability issues (interoperability meaning the platform that a Web service is running on becomes irrelevant). Another protocol that has a similar function is HTTP. It is used to access Web pages or to surf the Net. HTTP ensures that you do not have to worry about what kind of Web server -- whether Apache or IIS or any other -- serves you the pages you are viewing or whether the pages you view were created in ASP.NET or HTML.\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Because SOAP is used both for requesting and responding, its contents vary slightly depending on its purpose.&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of a SOAP request and response message\r\n\r\n**SOAP Request:**\r\n\r\n    POST /InStock HTTP/1.1 \r\n    Host: www.bookshop.org \r\n    Content-Type: application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8 \r\n    Content-Length: nnn \r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt; \r\n    &lt;soap:Envelope \r\n    xmlns:soap=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope&quot; \r\n    soap:encodingStyle=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-encoding&quot;&gt; \r\n    &lt;soap:Body xmlns:m=&quot;http://www.bookshop.org/prices&quot;&gt; \r\n    \t&lt;m:GetBookPrice&gt; \r\n    \t&lt;m:BookName&gt;The Fleamarket&lt;/m:BookName&gt; \r\n    \t&lt;/m:GetBookPrice&gt; \r\n    &lt;/soap:Body&gt; \r\n    &lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;\r\n    \t\r\n\r\n**SOAP Response:**\r\n\r\n\r\n    POST /InStock HTTP/1.1 \r\n    Host: www.bookshop.org \r\n    Content-Type: application/soap+xml; charset=utf-8 \r\n    Content-Length: nnn \r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt; \r\n    &lt;soap:Envelope \r\n    xmlns:soap=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope&quot; \r\n    soap:encodingStyle=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-encoding&quot;&gt; \r\n    &lt;soap:Body xmlns:m=&quot;http://www.bookshop.org/prices&quot;&gt; \r\n    \t&lt;m:GetBookPriceResponse&gt; \r\n    \t&lt;m: Price&gt;10.95&lt;/m: Price&gt; \r\n    \t&lt;/m:GetBookPriceResponse&gt; \r\n    &lt;/soap:Body&gt; \r\n    &lt;/soap:Envelope&gt; \r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough both messages look the same, they carry out different methods. For instance looking at the above examples you can see that the requesting message uses the `GetBookPrice` method to get the book price. The response is carried out by the `GetBookPriceResponse` method, which is going to be the message that you as the &quot;requestor&quot; will see. You can also see that the messages are composed using XML.\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Web Services Description Language or WSDL&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nWSDL is a document that describes a Web service and also tells you how to access and use its methods.\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;WSDL takes care of how do you know what methods are available in a Web service that you stumble across on the Internet.&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nTake a look at a sample WSDL file:\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt; \r\n    &lt;definitions  name =&quot;DayOfWeek&quot;  \r\n      targetNamespace=&quot;http://www.roguewave.com/soapworx/examples/DayOfWeek.wsdl&quot; \r\n      xmlns:tns=&quot;http://www.roguewave.com/soapworx/examples/DayOfWeek.wsdl&quot; \r\n      xmlns:soap=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/&quot;  \r\n      xmlns:xsd=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; \r\n      xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/&quot;&gt;  \r\n      &lt;message name=&quot;DayOfWeekInput&quot;&gt; \r\n    \t&lt;part name=&quot;date&quot; type=&quot;xsd:date&quot;/&gt; \r\n      &lt;/message&gt; \r\n      &lt;message name=&quot;DayOfWeekResponse&quot;&gt; \r\n    \t&lt;part name=&quot;dayOfWeek&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt; \r\n      &lt;/message&gt; \r\n      &lt;portType name=&quot;DayOfWeekPortType&quot;&gt; \r\n    \t&lt;operation name=&quot;GetDayOfWeek&quot;&gt; \r\n    \t  &lt;input message=&quot;tns:DayOfWeekInput&quot;/&gt; \r\n    \t  &lt;output message=&quot;tns:DayOfWeekResponse&quot;/&gt; \r\n    \t&lt;/operation&gt; \r\n      &lt;/portType&gt; \r\n      &lt;binding name=&quot;DayOfWeekBinding&quot; type=&quot;tns:DayOfWeekPortType&quot;&gt; \r\n    \t&lt;soap:binding style=&quot;document&quot;  \r\n    \t  transport=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http&quot;/&gt; \r\n    \t&lt;operation name=&quot;GetDayOfWeek&quot;&gt; \r\n    \t  &lt;soap:operation soapAction=&quot;getdayofweek&quot;/&gt; \r\n    \t  &lt;input&gt; \r\n    \t\t&lt;soap:body use=&quot;encoded&quot;  \r\n    \t\t  namespace=&quot;http://www.roguewave.com/soapworx/examples&quot;  \r\n    \t\t  encodingStyle=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot;/&gt; \r\n    \t  &lt;/input&gt; \r\n    \t  &lt;output&gt; \r\n    \t\t&lt;soap:body use=&quot;encoded&quot;  \r\n    \t\t  namespace=&quot;http://www.roguewave.com/soapworx/examples&quot;   \r\n    \t\t\tencodingStyle=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/&quot;/&gt; \r\n    \t  &lt;/output&gt; \r\n    \t&lt;/operation&gt; \r\n      &lt;/binding&gt; \r\n      &lt;service name=&quot;DayOfWeekService&quot; &gt; \r\n    \t&lt;documentation&gt; \r\n    \t  Returns the day-of-week name for a given date \r\n    \t&lt;/documentation&gt; \r\n    \t&lt;port name=&quot;DayOfWeekPort&quot; binding=&quot;tns:DayOfWeekBinding&quot;&gt; \r\n    \t  &lt;soap:address location=&quot;http://localhost:8090/dayofweek/DayOfWeek&quot;/&gt; \r\n    \t&lt;/port&gt; \r\n      &lt;/service&gt; \r\n    &lt;/definitions&gt; \r\n\r\nThe main things to remember about a WSDL file are that it provides you with:\r\n\r\n&lt;li&gt;A description of a Web service\r\n\r\n&lt;li&gt;The methods a Web service uses and the parameters that it takes\r\n\r\n&lt;li&gt;A way to locate Web services","title":"Difference between a SOAP message and a WSDL?","body":"<p>We need to define what is a web service before telling what are the difference between the SOAP and WSDL where the two (SOAP and WSDL) are components of a web service</p>\n\n<p>Most applications are developed to interact with users, the user enters or searches for data through an interface and the application then responds to the user's input.</p>\n\n<p>A Web service does more or less the same thing except that a Web service application communicates only from machine to machine or application to application.

Right now code is comparing date getTimeMillis to see if the end date time in millis is less than Day objects 23:59 UTC time or if the objects start time is greater than the Day object start time of 00:01.\nSo... is there a class out there that I can simply pass in the two date time's in millis, time zone and get a yes/no answer that handles all these offsets?\nI of course could do it all manually using the &quot;afterDate&quot; or &quot;beforeDate&quot; stuff but was hoping there is some fancy built already to handle it all already?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","mysql","spring","spring-boot","rest"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":7888329,"reputation":58,"user_id":5959501,"display_name":"Lucas"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1647045831,"creation_date":1647045831,"answer_id":71446066,"question_id":71445533,"body_markdown":"Can you put here full stacktrace of error that you get?\r\n\r\n    org.springframework.beans.factory.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: Error creating bean with name &#39;sellkonApplication&#39;: Unsatisfied dependency expressed through field &#39;sliderRepository&#39;;\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s only the top beginning of stacktrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"Java spring custom queries to mysql doesnt work properly","body":"<p>Can you put here full stacktrace of error that you get?</p>\n<pre><code>org.springframework.beans.factory.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: Error creating bean with name 'sellkonApplication': Unsatisfied dependency expressed through field 'sliderRepository';\n</code></pre>\n<p>It's only the top beginning of stacktrace.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":22750553,"reputation":321,"user_id":17236065,"display_name":"Pedro Luiz"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1647046591,"creation_date":1647046591,"answer_id":71446133,"question_id":71445533,"body_markdown":"Actually the error is on the query.\r\n\r\nA way to fix it would be to inform that it is a native query and that it is the value.

In the case of a many-to-many relationship, both sides can relate to multiple instances of the other side.\r\n\r\nNOTE: we need to create a separate table to hold the foreign keys for holding the many to many association in all these approaches\r\n\r\nExample : \r\n\r\n    @Entity\r\n    class Student {\r\n    \r\n        @Id\r\n        Long id;\r\n    \r\n        @ManyToMany\r\n        Set&lt;Course&gt; likedCourses;\r\n    \r\n        // additional properties\r\n        // standard constructors, getters, and setters\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    @Entity\r\n    class Course {\r\n    \r\n        @Id\r\n        Long id;\r\n    \r\n        @ManyToMany\r\n        Set&lt;Student&gt; likes;\r\n    \r\n        // additional properties\r\n        // standard constructors, getters, and setters\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOR We can do this with the @JoinTable annotation in the Student class.\r\n\r\n    @ManyToMany\r\n    @JoinTable(\r\n      name = &quot;course_like&quot;, \r\n      joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = &quot;student_id&quot;), \r\n      inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = &quot;course_id&quot;))\r\n    Set&lt;Course&gt; likedCourses;\r\n\r\nOn the target side, we only have to provide the name of the field, which maps the relationship.\r\n\r\n    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = &quot;likedCourses&quot;)\r\n    Set&lt;Student&gt; likes;\r\n\r\n2. Many-to-Many Using a Composite Key\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say we want to let students rate the courses. A student can rate any number of courses, and any number of students can rate the same course. Therefore, it&#39;s also a many-to-many relationship.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this example a bit more complicated is that there is more to the rating relationship than the fact that it exists. We need to store the rating score the student gave on the course.\r\n\r\nWhere can we store this information?

This form of Map only maintains weak references to the keys. Weak references don't hold up GC, so they key won't cause a memory accumulation. However, the values are <strong>not</strong> referenced weakly. So if the values are for example instances of the classes used as keys, the <code>WeakHashMap</code> does not work.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":76005,"reputation":38195,"user_id":217862,"accept_rate":64,"display_name":"ewernli"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1343794984,"creation_date":1271150337,"answer_id":2628352,"question_id":2625546,"body_markdown":"That depends where the reference `classToInstance=new HashMap();` is defined.\r\n\r\nA class points back to its class loader, and as a consequence, the class loader can not be garbage collected while a reference to the class exists.

It is not feasible to keep a copy of all data sent so far in memory just in case you may at some point wish to start over from the beginning. It is also not feasible to save a copy to disk. That slows everything way down and wastes 20GB of disk spaces if you don&#39;t need to ever go back, and you usually don&#39;t.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you say: Ah, but it&#39;s already a file. Okay, but BufferedReader is an abstraction that works just as well for data streamed over a network. This abstraction doesn&#39;t let you - because if it did, it could _not_ be used for large files being streamed like that.\r\n\r\nSo, what&#39;s the fix? It depends on what&#39;s happening.\r\n\r\n## Fix 1: Just.. re-open\r\n\r\nIf whatever stream you are reading can be recreated at will (example: You can just.. close this bufferedreader and call `Files.newBufferedReader` a second time, no problem - if a file is where you are getting this from) - then do so.\r\n\r\n## Fix 2: Cache in full\r\n\r\nPerhaps you know the data that&#39;s incoming is relatively small. Assuming it&#39;s also sent relatively quickly, one easy solution is to read it all in, and then you can repeatedly re-stream over the contents in memory. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nString data;\r\ntry (var in = someSocket.getInputStream()) {\r\n  data = new String(in.readAllBytes(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// now you can do this as many times as you want:\r\nBufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new StringReader(data));\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Fix 3: Stream a copy to disk\r\n\r\nYou can also write code that saves everything you read to disk _whilst_ processing it all. Assuming you go through the entire input and _then_ you want to go through it again, open the file for the second runthrough.\r\n\r\n## Fix 4: Forget about BufferedReader\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re just reading a file already, there&#39;s no need for BufferedReader which is an abstraction that fundamentally doesn&#39;t include at-will restarting. a `FileChannel` or `RandomAccessFile` object can be asked to reset their positions to 0. Note that they operate on bytes, not characters. This is particularly problematic if the data in it is a random-width character format such as the very common UTF-8.\r\n\r\n## Fix 5: limited rewind\r\n\r\nBufferedReader does support a _limited_ rewind feature, which is just implemented under the hood by saving the last X bytes read into memory. This is the &#39;mark&#39; system. You __have to__ decree how large that memory buffer can maximally be, and the BufferedReader object _will_ immediately create a buffer of that size when you do so. Thus, when reading a 1GB file, you could open the reader, set a mark for 1GB worth of data, start reading, and now you can reset at will. But note that this will increase your JVM&#39;s memory footprint by 1GB immediately, and cannot be used to save any more than 2GB (because java does not let you make arrays larger than that).\r\n\r\nLooks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry (BufferedReader br = howeverYouGetIt()) {\r\n  // let&#39;s reread the stream 100 times!\r\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {\r\n    if (i &gt; 0) br.reset(); // don&#39;t reset the first time.\r\n    br.mark(1234567); // how large should it be?\r\n    // code that reads goes here\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Fix 6: Reimagine the algorithm\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say that the only reason you need to go back to the start is for one relatively simple detail. Say, the file is a really really long list of first names and all you actually need to go through it a second time is to add up the amount of times that name &#39;Jane&#39; shows up in the list. Then instead perhaps you want to just.. count those names, now there&#39;s no need to restart at all:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMap&lt;String, Integer&gt; nameCounts = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\ntry (var br = howeverYouGetYourBufferedReader()) {\r\n  while (true) {\r\n    String name = br.readLine();\r\n    int count = nameCounts.getOrDefault(name, 0);\r\n    nameCounts.put(name, count + 1);\r\n    if (name.equals(&quot;Joe&quot;)) {\r\n      // let&#39;s say you want to go back and count all\r\n      // janes read so far when this happens...\r\n      int countOfJanes = nameCounts.get(&quot;Jane&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbout 50 other options come to mind, but surely you get the idea.","title":"readLine() reading from 1 line twice","body":"<p>The basic upshot is: <strong>That is impossible</strong>.</p>\n<p>BufferedReader is fundamentally a streaming concept.</p>\n<p>Imagine you have a file being streamed directly over a network that's 20GB in size.

File`. The name says it: That only works for __FILES__. Entries in jar files aren&#39;t themselves files.\r\n\r\nIf you write `new File`, or mention `FileInputStream`, you&#39;ve lost. That cannot be made to work with this stuff.\r\n\r\nFortunately, you can just ask the JVM to give you a resource from the same place it loads class files, whereever those class files might be.

Then the &quot;main&quot; thread can poll the queue(s) in an event-driven way, receiving and processing the messages.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this &quot;main&quot; thread MUST NOT be the event dispatch thread of a GUI framework.

In the case of retrieving the &quot;if-none-match&quot; header in `HttpServletRequest`, I see three different methods that could legitimately be used to retrieve the header: [`getHeader(String name)`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservletrequest#getHeader(java.lang.String)), [`getHeaders(String name)`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservletrequest#getHeaders(java.lang.String)), and [`getHeaderNames()`](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservletrequest#getHeaderNames()).  Furthermore, the argument for both `getHeader` and `getHeaders` are case-insensitive (the same results are returned for &quot;if-none-match&quot;, &quot;If-None-Match&quot;, etc.), so any possible argument casing would be correct.  It&#39;s very possible to support this with a direct mock, though it involves extra boilerplate code that complicates the test and makes it less obvious.\r\n\r\nThe [`MockHttpServletRequest`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/mock/web/MockHttpServletRequest.html) class from the [`spring-test`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/testing.html#integration-testing-overview) library mocks this interface, and allows setting the header and other values via a straightforward API.  While the library is designed for testing [Spring](https://spring.io) applications, the `MockHttpServletRequest` class is independent of any Spring-specific functionality, and should be completely usable on its own even if the application doesn&#39;t use Spring.","title":"How to mock HttpServletRequest with Headers?","body":"<p>For <a href=\"https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservletrequest\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>HttpServletRequest</code></a>, I would recommend using a fully functional mock type instead of directly mocking it with Mockito mocks.

In the case of retrieving the &quot;if-none-match&quot; header in <code>HttpServletRequest</code>, I see three different methods that could legitimately be used to retrieve the header: <a href=\"https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservletrequest#getHeader(java.lang.String)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>getHeader(String name)</code></a>, <a href=\"https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservletrequest#getHeaders(java.lang.String)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>getHeaders(String name)</code></a>, and <a href=\"https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservletrequest#getHeaderNames()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>getHeaderNames()</code></a>.  Furthermore, the argument for both <code>getHeader</code> and <code>getHeaders</code> are case-insensitive (the same results are returned for &quot;if-none-match&quot;, &quot;If-None-Match&quot;, etc.), so any possible argument casing would be correct.  It's very possible to support this with a direct mock, though it involves extra boilerplate code that complicates the test and makes it less obvious.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/mock/web/MockHttpServletRequest.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>MockHttpServletRequest</code></a> class from the <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/testing.html#integration-testing-overview\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>spring-test</code></a> library mocks this interface, and allows setting the header and other values via a straightforward API.  While the library is designed for testing <a href=\"https://spring.io\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Spring</a> applications, the <code>MockHttpServletRequest</code> class is independent of any Spring-specific functionality, and should be completely usable on its own even if the application doesn't use Spring.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":13282456,"reputation":21,"user_id":9589585,"display_name":"Sidz"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1637842744,"creation_date":1637842744,"answer_id":70111002,"question_id":37314469,"body_markdown":"This worked in my case \r\n\r\n```\r\nmockMvc.perform(post(&quot;&lt;&lt;url&gt;&gt;&quot;).content(&quot;&lt;&lt;jsonStrig&gt;&gt;&quot;).header(&quot;key&quot;, &quot;value&quot;));\r\n```\r\n\r\ncan also be used in get request.","title":"How to mock HttpServletRequest with Headers?","body":"<p>This worked in my case</p>\n<pre><code>mockMvc.perform(post(&quot;&lt;&lt;url&gt;&gt;&quot;).content(&quot;&lt;&lt;jsonStrig&gt;&gt;&quot;).header(&quot;key&quot;, &quot;value&quot;));\n</code></pre>\n<p>can also be used in get request.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":3506255,"reputation":3810,"user_id":2931744,"accept_rate":52,"display_name":"Sat"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":79663,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":22,"accepted_answer_id":37315412,"answer_count":4,"score":22,"last_activity_date":1647026458,"creation_date":1463635293,"question_id":37314469,"body_markdown":"I am using [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org) with [JUnit](https://junit.org) to test an application.
