However, in pure object oriented programming, you&#39;d also have *active methods* that perform actions on instances of this `employee` class. Now in the domain of employment, you may want to calculate the salary from the hours and wages. One way to do that is to have an hours and wage field and then calculate the salary from it. However, that precludes the use of a &quot;setter&quot; that sets the salary.\r\n\r\nInstead, you&#39;d calculate the salary from the hours and wages when requested, e.g. using a method called `calculateSalary()`. That method should **not** set a field, it should simply perform the calculation on the `hours` and `wage` fields (using *local* variables in the scope of the method where required). **If** you do set such a field then you can have a class that has an *inconsistent state*, i.e. the wage and hours may differ from the salary stored.

Startup Issues","body":"<p>I have installed Apache Tomcat 9.0 on Windows 10. Thus far all I have done is the install and started the service. The service starts and says it's running, but accessing Tomcat Manager or the Welcome Page produces a 404 error. There are clearly errors in the Tomcate9-stderr logs, but I have no idea what the issue may be. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times to no avail.

It is a <code>variable</code> inside a <code>class</code>(<code>class variable</code> or <code>instance variable</code>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>attribute</code> - in some articles you can find that <code>attribute</code> it is an <code>object</code> representation of <code>class variable</code>. <code>Object</code> operates by <code>attributes</code> which define a set of characteristics.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>CustomClass myCustomClass = new CustomClass();\nmyCustomClass.myAttribute = &quot;poor fantasy&quot;; //`myAttribute` is an attribute of `myCustomClass` object with a &quot;poor fantasy&quot; value\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/66282129/4770877\">[Objective-C attributes]</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>property</code> - <code>field</code> + bounded <code>getter/setter</code>. It has a field syntax but uses methods under the hood. <code>Java</code> does not support it in pure form.

This is contrary to the normal usage of a Map, where you look things up by their key rather than their value. I suggest either to use a map where count is the key, and the values are lists of books (having that count) OR to use a List with Book objects with the fields title and count. The latter approach is in my opinion the simplest and most object-oriented design (using maps to collect related fields is a code smell):\r\n\r\n    class Book {\r\n\r\n        String title;\r\n        int count;\r\n\r\n        Book(String title, int count) {\r\n            this.title = title;\r\n            this.count = count;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // accessors to be added\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // ...\r\n\r\n    List&lt;Book&gt; books = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    books.add(new Book(&quot;Chicken Abroad&quot;, 5));\r\n\r\nYou could print books with count==1 in one go like this:\r\n\r\n    books.stream()\r\n        .filter(book -&gt; book.getCount() == 1)\r\n        .map(book -&gt; book.getTitle());\r\n        forEach(book -&gt; System.out.println(book));\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to use a map, then this would make more sense:\r\n\r\n    private static Map&lt;Integer, List&lt;String&gt;&gt; bookTitlesByCount = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        addBookTitle(&quot;Chicken Abroad&quot;, 5);\r\n        List&lt;String&gt; whiteRavens = bookTitlesByCount.get(1);\r\n        // print them\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static void addBookTitle(String title, int count) {\r\n        List&lt;String&gt; bookTitles = bookTitlesByCount.get(count);\r\n        if (bookTitles == null) {\r\n            bookTitles = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n            bookTitlesByCount.put(count, bookTitles);\r\n        }\r\n        bookTitles.add(title);\r\n    }\r\n","title":"How to print keys of specific values in HashMap?","body":"<p>Your method createBooksCounter should probably return the map instead of <code>null</code>.

Regarding the name, I would name it bookCounts, since the map is not counting anything, just representing books and their 'counts'.</p>\n<pre><code>public static Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; createBookCounts() {\n    Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; bookCounts = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n    bookCounts .put(&quot;Chicken Abroad&quot;,5);\n    // ...\n    return bookCounts;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The method findWhiteRavens needs to look up all books in the map which have count==1. This is contrary to the normal usage of a Map, where you look things up by their key rather than their value. I suggest either to use a map where count is the key, and the values are lists of books (having that count) OR to use a List with Book objects with the fields title and count. The latter approach is in my opinion the simplest and most object-oriented design (using maps to collect related fields is a code smell):</p>\n<pre><code>class Book {\n\n    String title;\n    int count;\n\n    Book(String title, int count) {\n        this.title = title;\n        this.count = count;\n    }\n\n    // accessors to be added\n}\n\n// ...\n\nList&lt;Book&gt; books = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\nbooks.add(new Book(&quot;Chicken Abroad&quot;, 5));\n</code></pre>\n<p>You could print books with count==1 in one go like this:</p>\n<pre><code>books.stream()\n    .filter(book -&gt; book.getCount() == 1)\n    .map(book -&gt; book.getTitle());\n    forEach(book -&gt; System.out.println(book));\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you prefer to use a map, then this would make more sense:</p>\n<pre><code>private static Map&lt;Integer, List&lt;String&gt;&gt; bookTitlesByCount = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    addBookTitle(&quot;Chicken Abroad&quot;, 5);\n    List&lt;String&gt; whiteRavens = bookTitlesByCount.get(1);\n    // print them\n}\n\nprivate static void addBookTitle(String title, int count) {\n    List&lt;String&gt; bookTitles = bookTitlesByCount.get(count);\n    if (bookTitles == null) {\n        bookTitles = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n        bookTitlesByCount.put(count, bookTitles);\n    }\n    bookTitles.add(title);\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":23295836,"reputation":37,"user_id":17377261,"display_name":"Proximo_224"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":307,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":70214349,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1638535033,"creation_date":1638524549,"question_id":70212227,"body_markdown":"The question is how to pritn the books that have value = 1 in the HashMap, using the `printWhiteRavens(ArrayList&lt;String&gt; whiteRavens)` method ?

by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein, 2nd Edition. In chapter 24 they analyze &quot;single-source shortest paths&quot; algorithm and in 24.3 you have Dijkstra.\r\n\r\nI will use pseudo-code here. You could replace the min-priority queue below with another data structure like a map in Java. It won&#39;t be fast but it will work and that could be a satisfactory first try. I also have a Java implementation of a min-priority queue if you want.\r\n\r\nSay you have the maze represented by a 2D array like in your code: int[M][N] maze. The first index is the row index and the second is the column index, zero-based. Thus going from 0 to M-1 for the rows and from 0 to N-1 for the columns. The value maze[row][column] represent the danger associated with the room at (row, column). We need a convenient representation to get the weight between two rooms in the maze and to know which rooms are adjacent to a specific room.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to flatten the array and put every row side by side: row1, row2, ..., rowM. Then we can give an index i to each room. To be able to use this idea we need to convert between different type of coordinates: (row, column) -&gt; i and i -&gt; (row, column).\r\n\r\n    convert_to_index(row, column) ::= row * N + column\r\n    convert_to_pair(i) ::= (i div N, i modulo N)\r\n\r\nSay SIZE is M*N, the total number of rooms in the maze.\r\n\r\nNow we can make an adjacency matrix representing the maze with the danger values: int[SIZE][SIZE] adjacency_matrix, the first index is the FROM, the second is the TO. In a cell we find the cost or weight to go from one room to another. Note that given a specific room, there are only a few room that are adjacent to that room. The other rooms in the maze are not reachable from that room. By convention, we will use the biggest integer to indicate that and use the constant INFINITY. The other values represent danger and range from 0 to 9. The matrix will be sparse and there are techniques to optimize that.\r\n\r\nWhen we have a room located at (r, c), what are the rooms adjacent to it ? We want to have a vector of indices to be used directly in our algorithm. If we don&#39;t take the maze borders into account, we have: (r-1, c-1), (r-1, c), (r-1, c+1), (r, c-1), (r, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r+1, c) and (r+1,c+1).

In chapter 24 they analyze &quot;single-source shortest paths&quot; algorithm and in 24.3 you have Dijkstra.</p>\n<p>I will use pseudo-code here. You could replace the min-priority queue below with another data structure like a map in Java. It won't be fast but it will work and that could be a satisfactory first try. I also have a Java implementation of a min-priority queue if you want.</p>\n<p>Say you have the maze represented by a 2D array like in your code: int[M][N] maze. The first index is the row index and the second is the column index, zero-based. Thus going from 0 to M-1 for the rows and from 0 to N-1 for the columns. The value maze[row][column] represent the danger associated with the room at (row, column). We need a convenient representation to get the weight between two rooms in the maze and to know which rooms are adjacent to a specific room.</p>\n<p>The idea is to flatten the array and put every row side by side: row1, row2, ..., rowM. Then we can give an index i to each room. To be able to use this idea we need to convert between different type of coordinates: (row, column) -&gt; i and i -&gt; (row, column).</p>\n<pre><code>convert_to_index(row, column) ::= row * N + column\nconvert_to_pair(i) ::= (i div N, i modulo N)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Say SIZE is M*N, the total number of rooms in the maze.</p>\n<p>Now we can make an adjacency matrix representing the maze with the danger values: int[SIZE][SIZE] adjacency_matrix, the first index is the FROM, the second is the TO. In a cell we find the cost or weight to go from one room to another. Note that given a specific room, there are only a few room that are adjacent to that room. The other rooms in the maze are not reachable from that room. By convention, we will use the biggest integer to indicate that and use the constant INFINITY. The other values represent danger and range from 0 to 9. The matrix will be sparse and there are techniques to optimize that.</p>\n<p>When we have a room located at (r, c), what are the rooms adjacent to it ? We want to have a vector of indices to be used directly in our algorithm. If we don't take the maze borders into account, we have: (r-1, c-1), (r-1, c), (r-1, c+1), (r, c-1), (r, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r+1, c) and (r+1,c+1). We could then apply convert_to_index to each of them, check they are in the range 0..SIZE-1 and initialize the matrix with that. Thus, e.g., going from (r, c) to (r-1, c-1) has a cost or danger of maze[r-1, c-1] and going from (r-1, c-1) to (r, c) has a cost of maze[r, c].
