The database instance still needs to be initialised, the EMF &amp; EM created and the JDBC connection still needs to be subsequently established.\r\n\r\nOptions: \r\n\r\n 1. Share a common preloaded DB instance: seems not possible for your business scenario (although JSE technology supports this and also supports client-server design).  \r\n 2. Change to a DB with a faster startup: Derby (a.k.a. Java DB) is included in modern JVMs and has a startup time of about 1.5 seconds (cold) and 0.7 seconds (warm - data pre-loaded). \r\n 3. In many (most?) scenarios, the fastest solution would be to load data directly into in-memory java objects using JAXB with STAX.  Subsequently, use in-memory cached data (particularly using smart structures like maps, hashing and arraylists).  Just as JPA can map POJO classes to database tables &amp; columns, so JAXB can map POJO classes to XML schema &amp; work with XML doc instances.  If you have very complex queries using SQL set-based logic with multiple joins and strong use of DB indexes, this would be less desirable. \r\n\r\n(2) would probably give the best improvement for limited effort.  \r\nAdditionally: \r\n - try to unzip the data files during deployment rather than during app usage.\r\n - initialize the EMF in a startup thread that runs in parallel to the UI startup - try to start the DB initializing as one of the very first steps of the app (that means connecting to the actual instance using JDBC).\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"Hibernate faster EntityManagerFactory creation","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Can I turn off some EntityManagerFactory features to get an instance faster?</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Don't believe so.

The database instance still needs to be initialised, the EMF &amp; EM created and the JDBC connection still needs to be subsequently established.</p>\n\n<p>Options: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Share a common preloaded DB instance: seems not possible for your business scenario (although JSE technology supports this and also supports client-server design).  </li>\n<li>Change to a DB with a faster startup: Derby (a.k.a. Java DB) is included in modern JVMs and has a startup time of about 1.5 seconds (cold) and 0.7 seconds (warm - data pre-loaded). </li>\n<li>In many (most?) scenarios, the fastest solution would be to load data directly into in-memory java objects using JAXB with STAX.  Subsequently, use in-memory cached data (particularly using smart structures like maps, hashing and arraylists).  Just as JPA can map POJO classes to database tables &amp; columns, so JAXB can map POJO classes to XML schema &amp; work with XML doc instances.  If you have very complex queries using SQL set-based logic with multiple joins and strong use of DB indexes, this would be less desirable. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(2) would probably give the best improvement for limited effort.<br>\nAdditionally: \n - try to unzip the data files during deployment rather than during app usage.\n - initialize the EMF in a startup thread that runs in parallel to the UI startup - try to start the DB initializing as one of the very first steps of the app (that means connecting to the actual instance using JDBC).</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":323163,"reputation":2243,"user_id":643011,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"user643011"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":6710,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":27,"accepted_answer_id":15392862,"answer_count":2,"score":26,"last_activity_date":1679332225,"creation_date":1361585480,"question_id":15036233,"body_markdown":"In my desktop application new databases get opened quite often.

I've contacted IT in order to be able to run the command prompt in administrator mode and/or kick out my predecessor if he's still somehow logged into the system (According to some of <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19489720/maven-failed-to-clean-project-failed-to-delete-org-ow2-util-asm-asm-tree\">these answers</a>, that might be an issue.</p>\n<p>Apart from this I'm not really sure what to do. Any ideas?</p>\n<p>I don't really have access (at least to my knowledge) to some kind of fancy point-and-click interface, I have access the command prompt and that's it.</p>\n<p>[UPDATE 2]</p>\n<p>I managed to get administrator rights. That suppresses the first error, but the px-files still aren't generated. I get the same notes about invalid ini- and header files as above.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","class"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1082858,"reputation":104688,"user_id":1079354,"accept_rate":93,"display_name":"Makoto"},"score":1,"creation_date":1369682242,"post_id":16779245,"comment_id":24176814,"body_markdown":"[This will provide you an adequate answer.](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16728381/1079354)","body":"<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/16728381/1079354\">This will provide you an adequate answer.</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":6318774,"reputation":667,"user_id":4907720,"display_name":"Deepak"},"score":0,"creation_date":1469538629,"post_id":16779245,"comment_id":64569876,"body_markdown":"You can refer this link, providing the same knowledge:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/614818/what-is-the-difference-between-public-private-protected-and-nothing/614844#614844","body":"You can refer this link, providing the same knowledge: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/614818/what-is-the-difference-between-public-private-protected-and-nothing/614844#614844\" title=\"what is the difference between public private protected and nothing\">stackoverflow.com/questions/614818/&hellip;</a>"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":11683,"reputation":1438179,"user_id":22656,"accept_rate":86,"display_name":"Jon Skeet"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":54,"is_accepted":false,"score":54,"last_activity_date":1369682164,"creation_date":1369682164,"answer_id":16779258,"question_id":16779245,"body_markdown":"&gt; I have noticed that if don&#39;t write public before a class its works same as like a public class.\r\n\r\nNo it doesn&#39;t.

Is there another implementation of JPA handling this case correctly?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","amazon-web-services","maven"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":4297204,"reputation":2499,"user_id":9926179,"display_name":"b.s"},"score":0,"creation_date":1648873421,"post_id":71713849,"comment_id":126739730,"body_markdown":"share the main handler class which is implementing the `RequestHandler` interface.","body":"share the main handler class which is implementing the <code>RequestHandler</code> interface."}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3562886,"reputation":129,"user_id":7922545,"display_name":"izayoi"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1648883075,"creation_date":1648883075,"answer_id":71715537,"question_id":71713849,"body_markdown":"Please check following sample, save as `src\\main\\java\\com\\abc\\test\\TestServiceHandler.java` \r\n\r\n    package com.abc.test;\r\n    import java.io.IOException;\r\n    import java.io.InputStream;\r\n    import java.io.OutputStream;\r\n    \r\n    import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.Context;\r\n    import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.RequestStreamHandler;\r\n    import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.LambdaLogger;\r\n    \r\n    public class TestServiceHandler implements RequestStreamHandler {\r\n      \r\n      @Override\r\n      public void handleRequest(InputStream inputStream, OutputStream outputStream, Context context) throws IOException {\r\n          LambdaLogger logger = context.getLogger();\r\n          logger.log(&quot;Started up&quot;);\r\n          return;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nCompile, and upload jar as you mentioned in question.\r\n\r\nIn aws lambda console code tab, under Runtime settings, Handler, edit it to `com.abc.test.TestServiceHandler` to call lambda.\r\n\r\nPoint from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55299255/what-interface-should-a-serverless-scheduled-java-function-implement) says use `RequestStreamHandler` instead of `RequestHandler` which [sample from doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/java-handler.html) used.

It can be defined in-line right in the method it&#39;s used which will eliminate typical problems with public variables and the like.  In other words, it&#39;s absolutely better than a pair for this usage (due to the named members) and no worse.  \r\n\r\nIf you actually want a &quot;Pair&quot; for the key of a hashmap you are essentially creating a double-key index. I think this may be the one case where a &quot;Pair&quot; is significantly less code.  It&#39;s not really easier because you could have eclipse generate equals/hash on your little data class, but it would be a good deal more code. Here a Pair would be a quick fix, but if you need a double-indexed hash who&#39;s to say you don&#39;t need an n-indexed hash?

Better than a &quot;Pair&quot; object anyway.\r\n\r\nThe other case I can see a use for Pairs is a public api with return values for callers outside your current package.  For this I&#39;d just create a true object--preferably immutable. Eventually a caller will share this return value and having it mutable could be problematic. This is another case of the Pair object being worse--most pairs cannot be made immutable.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage to all these cases--the java class expands, my sum class needed a second sum and a &quot;Created&quot; flag by the time I was done, I would have had to throw away the Pair and gone with something else, but if the pair made sense, my class with 4 values still makes at least as much sense.","title":"What is the equivalent of the C++ Pair&lt;L,R&gt; in Java?","body":"<p>The answer by @Andreas Krey is actually good.
