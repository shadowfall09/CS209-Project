However, `a[5] = ...` will cause an `ArrayOutOfBoundsException` because the highest index in a 5-element array is 4.\r\n\r\n__Outer loop__\r\n\r\nYour outer loop moves into index 0 starting at the last element (`a[0] = a[j-1]`). This means after the first run of the inner loop you have `[1,1,2,3,4]` and now `a[0] = a[4]` will result in `[4,1,2,3,4]`.\r\n\r\nNow let&#39;s look at the other iterations of the outer loop:\r\n\r\n- `j = 4` -&gt; inner loop result: `[4,4,1,2,3]`, `a[0] = a[3]` results in `[2,4,1,2,3]` (value at `a[3]` is 2)\r\n- `j = 3` -&gt; inner loop result: `[2,2,4,1,2]`, `a[0] = a[2]` results in `[4,2,4,1,2]` (value at `a[2]` is 4)\r\n- `j = 2` -&gt; inner loop result: `[4,4,2,4,1]`, `a[0] = a[1]` results in `[4,4,2,4,1]` (value at `a[1]` is 4)\r\n- `j = 1` -&gt; inner loop result: `[4,4,4,2,4]`, `a[0] = a[0]` doesn&#39;t change anything so the end result would be `[4,4,4,2,4]`\r\n\r\n__How to shift in place__\r\n\r\nIf you want to shift elements in an array without creating a copy of the array, i.e. shift in place, you can do the following:\r\n\r\n     //replace 1st element\r\n     int replacedIndex = dir;\r\n\t int replacedValue = array[replacedIndex];\r\n\t array[replacedIndex] = array[0];\r\n\t\t \r\n\t //replace all other elements\r\n\t for( int i = 1; i &lt; array.length; i++) {\r\n\t\t replacedIndex = (replacedIndex + dir) % array.length;\t\t\t \r\n\t\t int temp = array[replacedIndex];\r\n\t\t array[replacedIndex] = replacedValue;\r\n\t\t replacedValue = temp;\r\n\t }\r\n\r\nWhat this means is the following:\r\n\r\nYou shift the first element to its new position which replaces another element. So you keep track of the replaced element and what index it was at. The loop now shifts the replaced element which replaces another one which the next iteration takes care of.\r\n\r\nSo shifting [A,B,C,D,E] by 2 would mean:\r\n\r\n- Initially shift A from index 0 to index 2, so C will be replaced. Result: [A,B,A,D,E].\r\n- C will be shifted from index 2 to index 4: [A,B,A,D,C]\r\n- E will be shifted from index 4 to index 1 (wrap around): [A,E,A,D,C]\r\n- B will be shifted from index 1 to index 3: [A,E,A,B,C]\r\n- D will be shifted from index 3 to index 0 (wrap around): [D,E,A,B,C]\r\n\r\nThe modulo operator can also be used to allow for larger shifts which basically are brought back into range, i.e. shifting a 4 element array by 13 is the same as shifting it by 1 (13 % 4 = 1).\r\n\r\nNegative shifts can be supported by bringing the shift into a positive range by adding the length, i.e. given a 5 element array a shift by -1 (1 to the left) is the same as a shift by 4 (4 to the right).\r\n\r\nSo you could do this at the start:\r\n\r\n    //copy the initial parameter to keep the original value\r\n    int dir = direction;\r\n  \r\n    //shift direction into a positive range\r\n\twhile( dir &lt; 0) {\r\n\t  dir += array.length;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    //bring any out-of-range direction back into range\r\n\tdir %= array.length;","title":"Movement Of Numbers in an array row","body":"<p><code>newCoordinateArray[i] = newCoordinateArray[i-1];</code> is basically shifting the elements to the back, i.e. the element at index 2 will get the value from index 1, then index 1 will get the value from index 0.

Now I don't know which option is more secure, coding a predefined salt and using PBKDF2 or using a truncated hash.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","android-toast"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":5344591,"reputation":1212,"user_id":4260491,"display_name":"BVantur"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":12,"is_accepted":true,"score":12,"last_activity_date":1606307667,"creation_date":1606307667,"answer_id":65004819,"question_id":65004242,"body_markdown":"As it said in Android documentation about Toast ***setGravity*** method, this method doesn&#39;t work anymore for devices running ***API30*** or higher.

That [API][3] is not built into Java. So you must make a Servlet API [JAR][4] file available to your [IDE][5] while developing.\r\n\r\nTypically in Java development we use a tool such as [Maven][6] or [Gradle][7] to assist our IDE in obtaining external dependencies such as the Servlet API JAR. \r\n\r\nIf you are using Maven, edit your [POM][8] file to specify a dependency for the Servlet API JAR published as part of the [Jakarta.ee][9] project, by the Eclipse Foundation. \r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/jakarta.servlet/jakarta.servlet-api --&gt;\r\n&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n    &lt;groupId&gt;jakarta.servlet&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;jakarta.servlet-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    &lt;version&gt;5.0.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n    &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice the `scope` element, with a value of `provided`. This means the JAR file should be downloaded, made available to your IDE while developing, but should *not* be copied into your resulting product when you build. \r\n\r\nThe output of your build will typically be a [WAR][10] file (not JAR). The `provided` scope means we do *not* want a copy of the Servlet API JAR within that WAR. The reason is that when developing Jakarta EE web apps, we expect to deploy to a compliant application server that carries its own copy of the Servlet API. Every “profile” of Jakarta EE compliant servers are required to include an implementation of the Servlet API. \r\n\r\nSo your POM will look something like this:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n&lt;project xmlns = &quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0&quot;\r\n         xmlns:xsi = &quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\r\n         xsi:schemaLocation = &quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;groupId&gt;work.basil.example&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;demo&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;\r\n    &lt;name&gt;demo&lt;/name&gt;\r\n    &lt;packaging&gt;war&lt;/packaging&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;properties&gt;\r\n        &lt;project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;UTF-8&lt;/project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;\r\n        &lt;maven.compiler.source&gt;17&lt;/maven.compiler.source&gt;\r\n        &lt;maven.compiler.target&gt;17&lt;/maven.compiler.target&gt;\r\n    &lt;/properties&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;dependencies&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/jakarta.servlet/jakarta.servlet-api --&gt;\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;jakarta.servlet&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jakarta.servlet-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;5.0.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n            &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter --&gt;\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.junit.jupiter&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;junit-jupiter&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;5.8.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n            &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;/dependencies&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;build&gt;\r\n        &lt;plugins&gt;\r\n            &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n                &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-war-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                &lt;version&gt;3.3.2&lt;/version&gt;\r\n            &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n        &lt;/plugins&gt;\r\n    &lt;/build&gt;\r\n&lt;/project&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here is the source code for a simple servlet.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage work.basil.example.demo;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.*;\r\n\r\nimport jakarta.servlet.http.*;\r\nimport jakarta.servlet.annotation.*;\r\n\r\n@WebServlet ( name = &quot;helloServlet&quot;, value = &quot;/hello-servlet&quot; )\r\npublic class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet\r\n{\r\n    private String message;\r\n\r\n    public void init ( )\r\n    {\r\n        message = &quot;Hello World!&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void doGet ( HttpServletRequest request , HttpServletResponse response ) throws IOException\r\n    {\r\n        response.setContentType( &quot;text/html&quot; );\r\n\r\n        // Hello\r\n        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();\r\n        out.println( &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&quot; );\r\n        out.println( &quot;&lt;h1&gt;&quot; + message + &quot;&lt;/h1&gt;&quot; );\r\n        out.println( &quot;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot; );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void destroy ( )\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou said:\r\n\r\n&gt; I&#39;ve tried uninstalling and reinstalling Tomcat several times \r\n\r\nCompletely unrelated to your problem, I expect.\r\n\r\nThe installation of Tomcat comes with an *implementation* of the Servlet API. But your IDE does not “see” Tomcat during development. Your IDE needs to see the [interfaces][1] defined in the Servlet API. \r\n\r\nYour IDE does not actually execute your servlet, so it does not need an implementation, it needs only the interfaces. When you run your Servlet from the IDE, Tomcat is invoked *externally* from the IDE. The IDE attaches a debugger connection to Tomcat to facilitate interactive debugging, but the IDE and Tomcat are actually running as separate distinct processes on the host OS. And as I said, Tomcat comes bundled with its own implementation of those interfaces, so your servlet is able to execute. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nYou said you are using Java 13. Be aware that Java 13 is no longer supported. You should move to either the latest version of Java (17, as of 2021-11), or to one of the [Long-Term Support (LTS)][11] versions (8, 11, 17). \r\n\r\nIf using Java 11 or 17 rather than 8, I would suggest using Tomcat 10.1.x rather than Tomcat 10.0.x. Tomcat 10.1.x supports Jakarta EE 9.1 and 10, which supports Java 11 and later versus Java 8. \r\n\r\nSee the [Tomcat version comparison page][12].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(Java)\r\n  [2]: https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API\r\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)\r\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\r\n  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven\r\n  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradle\r\n  [8]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven#Project_Object_Model\r\n  [9]: https://jakarta.ee/\r\n  [10]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAR_(file_format)\r\n  [11]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support\r\n  [12]: https://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html","title":"My IDE is not recognizing HTML commands for my servlet","body":"<h1>tl;dr</h1>\n<p>Your project lacks a JAR containing the definition of the Jakarta Servlet API (a set of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(Java)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">interfaces</a>).</p>\n<p>Add <code>jakarta.servlet-api</code> as a dependency to your project, to present to your IDE the needed JAR file during development but omitted from your final build’s WAR file.</p>\n<h1>Details</h1>\n<p>Your <code>import</code> statements refer to the <a href=\"https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jakarta Servlet</a> API.

But your IDE does not “see” Tomcat during development. Your IDE needs to see the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(Java)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">interfaces</a> defined in the Servlet API.</p>\n<p>Your IDE does not actually execute your servlet, so it does not need an implementation, it needs only the interfaces. When you run your Servlet from the IDE, Tomcat is invoked <em>externally</em> from the IDE. The IDE attaches a debugger connection to Tomcat to facilitate interactive debugging, but the IDE and Tomcat are actually running as separate distinct processes on the host OS. And as I said, Tomcat comes bundled with its own implementation of those interfaces, so your servlet is able to execute.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You said you are using Java 13. Be aware that Java 13 is no longer supported. You should move to either the latest version of Java (17, as of 2021-11), or to one of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Long-Term Support (LTS)</a> versions (8, 11, 17).</p>\n<p>If using Java 11 or 17 rather than 8, I would suggest using Tomcat 10.1.x rather than Tomcat 10.0.x. Tomcat 10.1.x supports Jakarta EE 9.1 and 10, which supports Java 11 and later versus Java 8.</p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tomcat version comparison page</a>.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":16837185,"reputation":33,"user_id":12173526,"display_name":"mario segale"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":98,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1637050745,"accepted_answer_id":69981077,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1637052369,"creation_date":1637011074,"question_id":69981007,"body_markdown":"I am learning how to create a servlet that takes HTML code and makes a program in my browser.\r\nThis code was supposed to output a simple welcome message in my browser via HTML.
