If both of these check out, then the `sudo` command executes the requested command as a different user; typically `root`.\r\n\r\nHowever, in order to do this, the &quot;sudo&quot; program itself is implemented as a &quot;setuid&quot; program; i.e. a program that *itself* that runs with elevated privileges.

To do this, you would need to make the `java` command a &quot;setuid&quot; program.  But the `java` command can execute ANY java program written by anyone.  So a &quot;setuid&quot; `java` would allow anyone to run any java program with administrator privileges.  That would be **insanely** insecure.\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nSo what are the alternatives?\r\n\r\n1. You could use `ProcessBuilder` to &quot;exec&quot; the `sudo` command as an external command.  However, passing a password to `sudo` via its command line is not possible.  So you would need to either:\r\n\r\n   - configure the `sudoers` file to allow the (specific) command to be executed without a password (potentially dangerous), or \r\n\r\n   - figure out a way to use the `--askPass` hook to request the user&#39;s password securely from Java, or\r\n\r\n   - use the `--stdin` option to read the user&#39;s password from standard input instead of the user&#39;s terminal.\r\n\r\n2. Write a custom &quot;setuid&quot; (or &quot;setgid&quot;) wrapper to execute the admin command.  Note: &quot;setuid&quot; shell scripts are fundamentally insecure.  A C / C++ wrapper is potentially the safest approach ... but you need to be sure that the wrapper can&#39;t be tricked into doing something dangerous / nasty by supplying clever arguments or environment variables.\r\n\r\n3. Don&#39;t do it in Java.  Get the user to run the privileged command from the command line; e.g. using `sudo`.  You could potentially make it easier for the user by providing a script (shell, perl, whatever) to handle anything complicated, do sanity checking, etcetera.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is approach #3 (in general).  It is the most secure and transparent approach.

This idea is known as dependency injection, or the dependency inversion principle.\r\n\r\nThe way we do this is to use interfaces. Here&#39;s an example of an application that prints some items:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\n\r\npublic class ItemPrinterApplication {\r\n    public ItemPrinterApplication(OutputWriter outputWriter, List&lt;Item&gt; items) {\r\n        this.outputWriter = outputWriter;\r\n        this.items = items;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void run() {\r\n            outputWriter.writeLine(&quot;Name, Price&quot;);\r\n            items.forEach(item -&gt; outputWriter.writeLine(item.name + &quot;, &quot; + item.price));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private OutputWriter outputWriter;\r\n    private List&lt;Item&gt; items;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`OutputWriter` is the thing responsible for the printing. It&#39;s just an interface, so the application doesn&#39;t know whether it writes to the console or somewhere else:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic interface OutputWriter {\r\n    void writeLine(String line);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor completeness, the `Item` class just holds some data:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Item {\r\n    public Item(String name, Integer price) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n        this.price = price;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public final String name;\r\n    public final Integer price;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can then write a test using [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) that checks that when I run this application, I get the output that I want. I do that by using an implementation of `OutputWriter` that just writes to a string. That way it&#39;s easy to check in the test:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;\r\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\n\r\npublic class ItemPrinterTest {\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void itPrintsAListOfItems() {\r\n        List&lt;Item&gt; items =\r\n                List.of(\r\n                        new Item(&quot;Apple&quot;, 50),\r\n                        new Item(&quot;Carrot&quot;, 25),\r\n                        new Item(&quot;Milk&quot;, 120)\r\n                );\r\n\r\n        FakeOutputWriter fakeOutputWriter = new FakeOutputWriter();\r\n        ItemPrinterApplication app = new ItemPrinterApplication(fakeOutputWriter, items);\r\n\r\n        app.run();\r\n\r\n        Assertions.assertEquals(\r\n                &quot;Name, Price\\n&quot; +\r\n                        &quot;Apple, 50\\n&quot; +\r\n                        &quot;Carrot, 25\\n&quot; +\r\n                        &quot;Milk, 120\\n&quot;,\r\n                fakeOutputWriter.written\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand `FakeOutputWriter` looks like\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class FakeOutputWriter implements OutputWriter {\r\n    public String written = &quot;&quot;;\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void writeLine(String line) {\r\n        written += line;\r\n        written += &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gives me confidence that I&#39;m writing the output correctly.

If you go below 0 return false (unbalanced). Or go until the end of the string and then check if the count is <code>0</code>, this will handle cases when you don't require ordering (just when the count of <code>(</code> == <code>)</code>)</p>\n\n<p>@EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>Ok so the problem is <code>String str = args[];</code> won't compile if you don't provide the index (i.e. <code>String str = args[0];</code>). Also you cannot call <code>toCharArray()</code> on <code>args</code> because that's a method defined on the <code>String</code> class and <code>args</code> is an <strong>array</strong> of <code>String</code>s.</p>\n\n<p>I would not recommend passing the text you want to count that way, it's not easy to use afterwards. How about instead you ass a test file name containing your text and read that instead?</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3831386,"reputation":119,"user_id":3176847,"display_name":"ThreeSidedCoin"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1438849277,"creation_date":1438848737,"answer_id":31850279,"question_id":31849977,"body_markdown":"Read the string from start to finish, use a stack to count the parentheses.

The server is also configured with a server identity (cert/key pair). The server certificate SubjectDN does NOT contain the server&#39;s hostname in the CN portion of the distinguished name. The server certificate also does NOT contain the server&#39;s IP address in an x.509 alternate names extension. \r\n\r\nMy client is configured with a client identity.

I understand that a new trust manager must be built whenever the trust store content is modified because the trust manager copies trust store content rather than holding a reference to the provided KeyStore object, so my code does this. When a client attempts to connect, the server does call checkClientTrusted and getAcceptedIssuers and the certificate contents displayed are correct.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the really weird part - it works intermittently. Sometimes I get successful connections and data interchanges, and sometimes it fails with the title error (seen in the server&#39;s JSSE debug output) and the associated client-side errors about PKIX path building mentioned above. \r\n\r\nOne more fact: The server is using a grizzly embedded server created from SSLEngineConfigurator, and the client is a pure Jersey client, configured with an SSLContext. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m at a total loss.
