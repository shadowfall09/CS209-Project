with the conflicting MongoDB driver versions in `spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb-reactive` and `querydsl-mongodb`.

One with <code>mongo-java-driver-3.12.8.jar</code> and another with <code>mongodb-driver-core-4.6.1.jar</code>.</p>\n<p>How can I mention java driver that works for both (basically overriding the conflicting version) in pom.xml ? I tried to explicitly mention <code>mongodb-java</code>/<code>mongodb-core</code> driver in pom.xml, but it didn't work.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","exceptionhandler"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":8646314,"reputation":2159,"user_id":6473398,"display_name":"sfiss"},"score":1,"creation_date":1580201816,"post_id":59945018,"comment_id":106010341,"body_markdown":"Have you had a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19498378/setting-precedence-of-multiple-controlleradvice-exceptionhandlers","body":"Have you had a look at <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19498378/setting-precedence-of-multiple-controlleradvice-exceptionhandlers\" title=\"setting precedence of multiple controlleradvice exceptionhandlers\">stackoverflow.com/questions/19498378/&hellip;</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":2928320,"reputation":1666,"user_id":5946480,"display_name":"Rishi Prakash"},"score":0,"creation_date":1580201869,"post_id":59945018,"comment_id":106010360,"body_markdown":"No I haven&#39;t, I am doing that now.

As we can't ask user to change the way the interact with our API (managament decision), i'm thinking on creating a custom authenticator, so when I request token endpoint (http://{ip}:{port}/auth/realms/{realm}/protocol/openid-connect/token) with an extra api-key header, I can check if there is an user with that api-key attribute assigned and get a bearer token for that user in return. The idea is to do this internally.</p>\n<p>Is it a correct approach? If so, how do I implement the authenticator? Once I have found the user by api-key, how do I tell the authenticator which is the authenticated user?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","reactjs","spring","spring-boot","react-router"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":7236580,"reputation":16350,"user_id":5521607,"accept_rate":25,"display_name":"Olivier Boiss&#233;"},"score":0,"creation_date":1676228898,"post_id":75429187,"comment_id":133091023,"body_markdown":"dou you have any `index.html` page in your project ?","body":"dou you have any <code>index.html</code> page in your project ?"},{"owner":{"account_id":10046033,"reputation":672,"user_id":7427398,"accept_rate":32,"display_name":"ksernow"},"score":0,"creation_date":1676231030,"post_id":75429187,"comment_id":133091399,"body_markdown":"It gets build during react build.

This works perfectly, with text as well as with images, encryption as well as decryption.\r\n\r\nHowever, I now wanted to make an app in kotlin (using the fernet-java8 library) to be able to decrypt my data without my computer. For that, I use the following function to retrieve the data from the file:\r\n```\r\nval input: InputStream? = data!!.data?.let { getContentResolver().openInputStream(it) }\r\nval inputAsString = input?.bufferedReader().use { it?.readText() } \r\n```\r\nThis code is more or less copied together from various posts.

However, when I try to decrypt an image, the resulting file (which is then saved to Downloads) is not properly working and it cant be displayed. This makes (kind of) sense, because everything in this method is a string (Although when going by the python script, you would not need to distinct between the type of data). But when I try to change the method Token.fromString() to Token.fromBytes() and give a ByteArray object instead of a String, the method crashes with the following exception:\r\n```\r\nProcess: com.example.cryptomobile, PID: 12020\r\n    java.time.DateTimeException: Instant exceeds minimum or maximum instant\r\n        at java.time.Instant.create(Instant.java:405)\r\n        at java.time.Instant.ofEpochSecond(Instant.java:298)\r\n        at com.macasaet.fernet.Token.fromBytes(Token.java:136)\r\n        at com.example.cryptomobile.MainActivity.decrypt(MainActivity.kt:120)\r\n```\r\nQuite frankly, I have no idea whatsoever what this is supposed to mean or how I can fix it. I don&#39;t necessarily need to use the fromBytes method, if the picture decryption works with the fromString method too and my mistake is somewhere else, tell me and I will find it. Otherwise, any help on how I can decrypt pictures and text and/or fix or evade this exception would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nIf you need any additional information on my code, feel free to tell me, I am not very experienced on StackOverflow.\r\nThanks in advance.","title":"fernet.Token.fromBytes() fails with DateTimeException","body":"<p>I wrote a small python script a while ago, which uses the python cryptography module to encrypt some data using fernet.

For that, I use the following function to retrieve the data from the file:</p>\n<pre><code>val input: InputStream? = data!!.data?.let { getContentResolver().openInputStream(it) }\nval inputAsString = input?.bufferedReader().use { it?.readText() } \n</code></pre>\n<p>This code is more or less copied together from various posts. The data is then decrypted using this method:</p>\n<pre><code>fun decrypt(decabledata:String){\n        println(decabledata.toString())\n        val token=Token.fromString(decabledata)\n        //val token=decabledata\n        //val token= Token.fromString(&quot;gAAAAABj512Pcv-sxoGmeeI5oM-a_GSOSUORKjxrp1QEtZH97Gv0XpYFTcMS2MDD8bPBTI_WYbadmG7dcdqE72ySNx_9K6A2sA==&quot;)\n        val fernetKey=Key(&quot;MYKEY&quot;)\n\n        val validator: Validator&lt;String&gt; = object : StringValidator {\n            @RequiresApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.O)\n            override fun getTimeToLive(): TemporalAmount {\n                //val timere:Long = 24\n                return Duration.ofSeconds(Instant.MAX.getEpochSecond())\n            }\n        }\n        val data = token.validateAndDecrypt(fernetKey, validator)\n        val resview=findViewById(R.id.textView1) as TextView\n        resview.setText(data.toString())\n        println(data)\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This also works perfectly when decrypting text files. However, when I try to decrypt an image, the resulting file (which is then saved to Downloads) is not properly working and it cant be displayed. This makes (kind of) sense, because everything in this method is a string (Although when going by the python script, you would not need to distinct between the type of data). But when I try to change the method Token.fromString() to Token.fromBytes() and give a ByteArray object instead of a String, the method crashes with the following exception:</p>\n<pre><code>Process: com.example.cryptomobile, PID: 12020\n    java.time.DateTimeException: Instant exceeds minimum or maximum instant\n        at java.time.Instant.create(Instant.java:405)\n        at java.time.Instant.ofEpochSecond(Instant.java:298)\n        at com.macasaet.fernet.Token.fromBytes(Token.java:136)\n        at com.example.cryptomobile.MainActivity.decrypt(MainActivity.kt:120)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Quite frankly, I have no idea whatsoever what this is supposed to mean or how I can fix it. I don't necessarily need to use the fromBytes method, if the picture decryption works with the fromString method too and my mistake is somewhere else, tell me and I will find it. Otherwise, any help on how I can decrypt pictures and text and/or fix or evade this exception would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>If you need any additional information on my code, feel free to tell me, I am not very experienced on StackOverflow.\nThanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","spring-security","graalvm","graalvm-native-image"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":13215296,"reputation":458,"user_id":9544067,"display_name":"V.

It does not address how to represent a graph visually.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m going to assume the number of nodes needed will be known. If that is not the case, this answer will need to be changed.\r\n\r\nA common way to represent edges of a graph is to use an adjacency matrix. Given `n` Nodes, the simplest adjacency matrix for a directed graph is an 2D array of `boolean`:\r\n\r\n     boolean [][] adjacent = new boolean [n][n];\r\n\r\nThis requires each `Node` to be associated with an index. One way to do that is to use an array:\r\n\r\n     Node [] myNodes = new node [n];\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, finding out if there is an edge between two nodes is simple:\r\n\r\n     public boolean areConnected (int a, int b) { \r\n        return adjacent [a][b];\r\n     }\r\n\r\nAnd, they are easy to connect:\r\n\r\n      public void Connect (int from, int to) { \r\n           adjacent [from][to] = true;\r\n      }\r\n\r\nIf you need to search to find the index of a Node, you can add this code: \r\n\r\n     public int indexOf (Node node) { \r\n         int index = -1;\r\n         for (int i = 0; i &lt; myNodes.length; ++i) {\r\n            if (node.equals (myNode [i]) { \r\n               index = i;\r\n               break;\r\n            }\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      public boolean areConnected (Node a, Node b) { \r\n          int locA = indexOf (a);\r\n          int locB = indexOf (b);\r\n          if (locA &lt; 0 || locB &lt; 0) { \r\n             return false;\r\n          }\r\n          return areConnected (locA, locB);\r\n      } \r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Please seriously consider overriding `equals (Object other)` and `hashCode()` methods. Whether you use an adjacency matrix as described here, or a `Collection`, the default `.equals (Object other)` will be equivalent to `this == other`. That is, it will test if they refer to the same Object.  If you want to know if the contents of `Node` Objects are the same, you need to override `equals`. If you override `equals`, you should also override `hashCode()`.\r\n\r\n**Note:** You will want to decide how to guard against the possibility that an invalid index or node will be passed to `areConnected` or `Connect`. You might, for example, want to throw an exception.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This assumes a directed graph. \r\n\r\n**Comment:** The beginning of this answer has this statement: *&quot;I&#39;m going to assume the number of nodes needed will be known early.&quot;* &quot;Early&quot; means &quot;before the matrix is constructed&quot;. One way to represent an adjacency matrix in which the number of nodes is flexible is to use a `List&lt;List&lt;Boolean&gt;&gt;`. That can represent a 2D `List`.\r\n\r\nAn adjacency matrix is not restricted to `boolean`. For example, if each `Node` represented a city, the adjacency matrix might be an `int [][]` , where each entry represents the number of highway miles between cities. A `double` might represent the geographic distance. A `BigDecimal [][]` could represent the price of airfare between the cities.

It does not address how to represent a graph visually.</p>\n<p>I'm going to assume the number of nodes needed will be known. If that is not the case, this answer will need to be changed.</p>\n<p>A common way to represent edges of a graph is to use an adjacency matrix. Given <code>n</code> Nodes, the simplest adjacency matrix for a directed graph is an 2D array of <code>boolean</code>:</p>\n<pre><code> boolean [][] adjacent = new boolean [n][n];\n</code></pre>\n<p>This requires each <code>Node</code> to be associated with an index. One way to do that is to use an array:</p>\n<pre><code> Node [] myNodes = new node [n];\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, finding out if there is an edge between two nodes is simple:</p>\n<pre><code> public boolean areConnected (int a, int b) { \n    return adjacent [a][b];\n }\n</code></pre>\n<p>And, they are easy to connect:</p>\n<pre><code>  public void Connect (int from, int to) { \n       adjacent [from][to] = true;\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you need to search to find the index of a Node, you can add this code:</p>\n<pre><code> public int indexOf (Node node) { \n     int index = -1;\n     for (int i = 0; i &lt; myNodes.length; ++i) {\n        if (node.equals (myNode [i]) { \n           index = i;\n           break;\n        }\n     }\n  }\n\n  public boolean areConnected (Node a, Node b) { \n      int locA = indexOf (a);\n      int locB = indexOf (b);\n      if (locA &lt; 0 || locB &lt; 0) { \n         return false;\n      }\n      return areConnected (locA, locB);\n  } \n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Please seriously consider overriding <code>equals (Object other)</code> and <code>hashCode()</code> methods. Whether you use an adjacency matrix as described here, or a <code>Collection</code>, the default <code>.equals (Object other)</code> will be equivalent to <code>this == other</code>. That is, it will test if they refer to the same Object.  If you want to know if the contents of <code>Node</code> Objects are the same, you need to override <code>equals</code>. If you override <code>equals</code>, you should also override <code>hashCode()</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You will want to decide how to guard against the possibility that an invalid index or node will be passed to <code>areConnected</code> or <code>Connect</code>. You might, for example, want to throw an exception.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This assumes a directed graph.</p>\n<p><strong>Comment:</strong> The beginning of this answer has this statement: <em>&quot;I'm going to assume the number of nodes needed will be known early.&quot;</em> &quot;Early&quot; means &quot;before the matrix is constructed&quot;. One way to represent an adjacency matrix in which the number of nodes is flexible is to use a <code>List&lt;List&lt;Boolean&gt;&gt;</code>. That can represent a 2D <code>List</code>.</p>\n<p>An adjacency matrix is not restricted to <code>boolean</code>. For example, if each <code>Node</code> represented a city, the adjacency matrix might be an <code>int [][]</code> , where each entry represents the number of highway miles between cities. A <code>double</code> might represent the geographic distance. A <code>BigDecimal [][]</code> could represent the price of airfare between the cities. It could be an array of Objects of a class you create.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":25504041,"reputation":1,"user_id":19296792,"display_name":"Chri"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":83,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1676302594,"creation_date":1675204993,"question_id":75303910,"body_markdown":"I want to make a program where you can make nodes and connect them, I wanna make Graphical interface so you can see the graphs.

Another structure where you count `hash[arr[i]-1]++` the number of occurrences for any given index `i` in the array. Example:\r\n\r\nIf you have `arr[2,1,3,5,3,2]` hashmap will begin in an 6 zero array: `hashmap[0,0,0,0,0,0]` because that&#39;s the size of `arr`. As the algorithm progress it will sum `+1` in the position `arr[i]-1`. It&#39;s using the value as the index of the sum. At then end you get: `arr[1,2,2,0,1,0]`.\r\n\r\nThis has ***O(n)*** in time complexity because it runs the full arr, and ***O(n)*** in time because it runs the array at least 1 time.\r\n\r\n## Without Hashmap\r\n\r\nThe idea of the algorithm above is that you don&#39;t need the extra structure of a hashmap but can use the same array to count the frequency. This might lead to a problem. Let `i-th` element be `a` or (`arr[i]=a`) then the count should be stored at `arr[arr[i]-1]` or (`arr[a-1]`), but when the frequency will be stored the element will be lost.\r\n\r\nExample iteration:  \r\n1. `a[2,1,3,5,3,2]` -&gt; `a[2,1,3,5,3,2]`\r\n2. `a[2,1,3,5,3,2]` -&gt; `a[1,1,3,5,3,2]`\r\n3. `a[1,1,3,5,3,2]` -&gt; `a[1,1,1,5,3,2]`\r\n4. `a[1,1,1,5,3,2]` -&gt; `a[1,1,1,5`**`,1`**,`2]` As you can see we lost the value of `3` when we read `5` as it stored the frequency in `arr[arr[4]-1]` or (`arr[5-1]`).\r\n\r\n#### Solve the missing problem\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem first we put replace the i-th element with `arr[arr[i]-1]` or (`arr[a-1]`) then put `-1` at array `arr[arr[i]-1]` or (`arr[a-1]`). \r\nThe algorithm:\r\n1. Traverse the array from start to end.\r\n2. For each element check if the element is less than or equal to zero or not. If negative or zero skip the element as it is frequency.\r\n3. If an element (`a = arr[i] – 1`) is positive, then check if `arr[a]` is positive or not. If positive then that means it is the first occurrence of `a` in the array and replace `arr[i]` with `arr[a]`, and assign `arr[a] = -1`. If `arr[a]` is negative, then it is not the first occurrence, then update `arr[a]` as `arr[a]--` and update `arr[i]` as `arr[i] = 0`. You use an auxiliary value to save arr[a] that will be used in the next iteration.\r\n4. Again, traverse the array and print `i+1` as value and `arr[i]` as frequency.\r\n\r\nExample iteration: \r\n1. `a[2,1,3,5,3,2]` -&gt; `a[1,1,3,5,3,2]` -&gt; `a[1,-1,3,5,3,2]`\r\n2. `a[1,-1,3,5,3,2]` -&gt; `a[1,-1,3,5,3,2]` -&gt; `a[1,-1,-1,5,3,2]`\r\n3. `a[1,-1,-1,5,3,2]` -&gt; `a[1,-1,-1,0,3,2]`\r\n4. `a[1,-1,-1,0,3,2]` -&gt; `a[1,-1,-1,0,-1,2]` -&gt; `a[1,-1,-2,0,-1,2]`\r\n5. `a[1,-1,-2,0,-1,2]` -&gt; `a[1,-1,-2,0,-1,0]`\r\n6. `a[1,-1,-2,0,-1,0]` -&gt; `a[1,-2,-2,0,-1,0]`\r\n\r\n## firstDuplicate\r\n\r\nAfter knowing this we can now grasp how `firstDuplicate` works. The idea is not to count the frequency but instead just print the `index` that has already a negative in frequency. When we get a negative frequency we return.\r\nSo running the algorithm we get:\r\n\r\n1. With `if(a[2-1]&lt;0)` or `if(1&lt;0)` this comparation is between `arr[arr[0]-1]` or (`arr[1]`) and `0` so we don&#39;t return. `a[2,1,3,5,3,2]` -&gt; `a[2,-1,3,5,3,2]`\r\n2. With `if(a[1-1]&lt;0)` or `if(2&lt;0)` we don&#39;t return `a[2,-1,3,5,3,2]` -&gt; `a[-1,-1,3,5,3,2]`.\r\n3. With `if(a[3-1]&lt;0)` or `if(3&lt;0)` we don&#39;t return. `a[-1,-1,3,5,3,2]` -&gt; `a[-2,-1,-3,5,3,2]` \r\n4. With `if(a[5-1]&lt;0)` or `if(3&lt;0)` we don&#39;t return. `a[-2,-1,-3,5,3,2]` -&gt; `a[-2,-1,-3,5,-3,2]`\r\n5. With `if(a[3-1]&lt;0)` or `if(-3&lt;0)` we return.\r\n\r\n**All of this is based on the idea that `element-1` is the index.**\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-frequencies-elements-array-o1-extra-space-time/","title":"find the first duplicate element in an array having the minimal index","body":"<pre><code>int firstDuplicate(int[] a){\nint n = a.length;\nfor(int i=0; i&lt;n; i++)\n   {\n    if(a[Math.abs(a[i])-1]&lt;0) return Math.abs(a[i]);\n    else a[Math.abs(a[i])-1] = - a[Math.abs(a[i])-1];\n   }\nreturn -1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I will explain why and how this one works.\nIt's important that this constrain: <code>1 ≤ a[i] ≤ a.length</code> is present, meaning that in an array like this: <code>a = [2,8,2]</code> this algorithm <strong>WILL NOT work</strong> because <strong>8</strong> is <strong>bigger</strong> than <code>a.length</code> in this case <strong>3</strong>.</p>\n<p>You'll find the explanation <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-frequencies-elements-array-o1-extra-space-time/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> as well:</p>\n<h2>Hashmap</h2>\n<p>This solution follows the idea of a hashmap. Another structure where you count <code>hash[arr[i]-1]++</code> the number of occurrences for any given index <code>i</code> in the array. Example:</p>\n<p>If you have <code>arr[2,1,3,5,3,2]</code> hashmap will begin in an 6 zero array: <code>hashmap[0,0,0,0,0,0]</code> because that's the size of <code>arr</code>. As the algorithm progress it will sum <code>+1</code> in the position <code>arr[i]-1</code>. It's using the value as the index of the sum. At then end you get: <code>arr[1,2,2,0,1,0]</code>.</p>\n<p>This has <em><strong>O(n)</strong></em> in time complexity because it runs the full arr, and <em><strong>O(n)</strong></em> in time because it runs the array at least 1 time.</p>\n<h2>Without Hashmap</h2>\n<p>The idea of the algorithm above is that you don't need the extra structure of a hashmap but can use the same array to count the frequency. This might lead to a problem. Let <code>i-th</code> element be <code>a</code> or (<code>arr[i]=a</code>) then the count should be stored at <code>arr[arr[i]-1]</code> or (<code>arr[a-1]</code>), but when the frequency will be stored the element will be lost.</p>\n<p>Example iteration:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>a[2,1,3,5,3,2]</code> -&gt; <code>a[2,1,3,5,3,2]</code></li>\n<li><code>a[2,1,3,5,3,2]</code> -&gt; <code>a[1,1,3,5,3,2]</code></li>\n<li><code>a[1,1,3,5,3,2]</code> -&gt; <code>a[1,1,1,5,3,2]</code></li>\n<li><code>a[1,1,1,5,3,2]</code> -&gt; <code>a[1,1,1,5</code><strong><code>,1</code></strong>,<code>2]</code> As you can see we lost the value of <code>3</code> when we read <code>5</code> as it stored the frequency in <code>arr[arr[4]-1]</code> or (<code>arr[5-1]</code>).</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Solve the missing problem</h4>\n<p>To solve this problem first we put replace the i-th element with <code>arr[arr[i]-1]</code> or (<code>arr[a-1]</code>) then put <code>-1</code> at array <code>arr[arr[i]-1]</code> or (<code>arr[a-1]</code>).\nThe algorithm:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Traverse the array from start to end.</li>\n<li>For each element check if the element is less than or equal to zero or not. If negative or zero skip the element as it is frequency.</li>\n<li>If an element (<code>a = arr[i] – 1</code>) is positive, then check if <code>arr[a]</code> is positive or not. If positive then that means it is the first occurrence of <code>a</code> in the array and replace <code>arr[i]</code> with <code>arr[a]</code>, and assign <code>arr[a] = -1</code>. If <code>arr[a]</code> is negative, then it is not the first occurrence, then update <code>arr[a]</code> as <code>arr[a]--</code> and update <code>arr[i]</code> as <code>arr[i] = 0</code>. You use an auxiliary value to save arr[a] that will be used in the next iteration.</li>\n<li>Again, traverse the array and print <code>i+1</code> as value and <code>arr[i]</code> as frequency.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Example iteration:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>a[2,1,3,5,3,2]</code> -&gt; <code>a[1,1,3,5,3,2]</code> -&gt; <code>a[1,-1,3,5,3,2]</code></li>\n<li><code>a[1,-1,3,5,3,2]</code> -&gt; <code>a[1,-1,3,5,3,2]</code> -&gt; <code>a[1,-1,-1,5,3,2]</code></li>\n<li><code>a[1,-1,-1,5,3,2]</code> -&gt; <code>a[1,-1,-1,0,3,2]</code></li>\n<li><code>a[1,-1,-1,0,3,2]</code> -&gt; <code>a[1,-1,-1,0,-1,2]</code> -&gt; <code>a[1,-1,-2,0,-1,2]</code></li>\n<li><code>a[1,-1,-2,0,-1,2]</code> -&gt; <code>a[1,-1,-2,0,-1,0]</code></li>\n<li><code>a[1,-1,-2,0,-1,0]</code> -&gt; <code>a[1,-2,-2,0,-1,0]</code></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>firstDuplicate</h2>\n<p>After knowing this we can now grasp how <code>firstDuplicate</code> works.

The second occurrence of 3 has a smaller index than the second occurrence of 2 does, so the answer is 3.</p>\n\n<p>I tried this :</p>\n\n<pre><code>int firstDuplicate(int[] a) {\n  Set&lt;Integer&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\n  Map&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; hm = new HashMap&lt;Integer,Integer&gt;();\n  Map.Entry&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; min = null;\n  for(int i=0;i&lt;a.length;i++){\n       // if(!hm.containsKey(a[i]))\n              hm.put(a[i],i);\n  }\n  for(Map.Entry&lt;Integer,Integer&gt; entry : hm.entrySet()){\n        if(min == null || entry.getValue() &lt; min.getValue()){\n              min = entry;\n        }\n  }\n  return min == null ? new Integer(-1) : min.getKey();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}</p>\n\n<p>It's not working out, but I got another solution online which is like this :</p>\n\n<pre><code>int firstDuplicate(int[] a) {\n  Set&lt;Integer&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\n  Map&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; hm = new HashMap&lt;Integer,Integer&gt;();\n  Map.Entry&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; min = null;\n  for(int i=0;i&lt;a.length;i++){\n        if(set.add(a[i])==false &amp;&amp; !hm.containsKey(a[i]))\n              hm.put(a[i],i);\n  }\n  for(Map.Entry&lt;Integer,Integer&gt; entry : hm.entrySet()){\n        if(min == null || entry.getValue() &lt; min.getValue()){\n              min = entry;\n        }\n  }\n  return min == null ? new Integer(-1) : min.getKey();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>}</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone please explain me the use of Hashset here, as it doesn't allow the duplicates so how that if condition will be workable. </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","jpa","spring-data-jpa","h2"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1573445,"reputation":4861,"user_id":1460591,"accept_rate":79,"display_name":"Youans"},"score":1,"creation_date":1676136927,"post_id":75422020,"comment_id":133078860,"body_markdown":"So do you get an error when you run the application?","body":"So do you get an error when you run the application?"},{"owner":{"account_id":17741504,"reputation":1083,"user_id":12881733,"display_name":"Bill Mair"},"score":0,"creation_date":1676137351,"post_id":75422020,"comment_id":133078941,"body_markdown":"See: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-data-sql-and-schema-sql","body":"See: <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-data-sql-and-schema-sql\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">baeldung.com/spring-boot-data-sql-and-schema-sql</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":13867576,"reputation":120,"user_id":10011738,"display_name":"amir rad"},"score":0,"creation_date":1676138514,"post_id":75422020,"comment_id":133079142,"body_markdown":"maybe depend on repository or service or resource layers, would you please share these layers?","body":"maybe depend on repository or service or resource layers, would you please share these layers?"},{"owner":{"account_id":12743722,"reputation":19956,"user_id":12567365,"display_name":"andrewJames"},"score":1,"creation_date":1676148899,"post_id":75422020,"comment_id":133080840,"body_markdown":"Side note: &quot;_... `javax.persistence` ...
