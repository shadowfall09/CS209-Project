And in terms of tick complexity your second algorithm surely wins.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is the fastest way to compute k smallest elements?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I've came up with the next solution which I do believe allows <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/11227902/3707125\">branch prediction</a> to do its job:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Benchmark\npublic void testModified(Blackhole bh) {\n    final double[] scores = sampleData;\n    int[] candidates = new int[numberNeighbours];\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberNeighbours; i++) {\n        candidates[i] = i;\n    }\n    // sorting candidates so scores[candidates[0]] is the largest\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberNeighbours; i++) {\n        for (int j = i+1; j &lt; numberNeighbours; j++) {\n            if (scores[candidates[i]] &lt; scores[candidates[j]]) {\n                int temp = candidates[i];\n                candidates[i] = candidates[j];\n                candidates[j] = temp;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    // processing other scores, while keeping candidates array sorted in the descending order\n    for (int i = numberNeighbours; i &lt; numberExamples; i++) {\n        if (scores[i] &gt; scores[candidates[0]]) {\n            continue;\n        }\n        // moving all larger candidates to the left, to keep the array sorted\n        int j; // here the branch prediction should kick-in\n        for (j = 1; j &lt; numberNeighbours &amp;&amp; scores[i] &lt; scores[candidates[j]]; j++) {\n            candidates[j - 1] = candidates[j];\n        }\n        // inserting the new item\n        candidates[j - 1] = i;\n    }\n    bh.consume(candidates);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Benchmark results (2x times faster than your current solution):</p>\n\n<pre><code>(10 neighbours) CounterBenchmark.testModified    thrpt    2  136492,151          ops/s\n(20 neighbours) CounterBenchmark.testModified    thrpt    2  118395,598          ops/s\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Others mentioned <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickselect\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">quickselect</a>, but as one may expect, the complexity of that algorithm neglects its strong sides in your case:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Benchmark\npublic void testQuickSelect(Blackhole bh) {\n    final int[] candidates = new int[sampleData.length];\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; candidates.length; i++) {\n        candidates[i] = i;\n    }\n    final int[] resultIndices = new int[numberNeighbours];\n    int neighboursToAdd = numberNeighbours;\n\n    int left = 0;\n    int right = candidates.length - 1;\n    while (neighboursToAdd &gt; 0) {\n        int partitionIndex = partition(candidates, left, right);\n        int smallerItemsPartitioned = partitionIndex - left;\n        if (smallerItemsPartitioned &lt;= neighboursToAdd) {\n            while (left &lt; partitionIndex) {\n                resultIndices[numberNeighbours - neighboursToAdd--] = candidates[left++];\n            }\n        } else {\n            right = partitionIndex - 1;\n        }\n    }\n    bh.consume(resultIndices);\n}\n\nprivate int partition(int[] locations, int left, int right) {\n    final int pivotIndex = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(left, right + 1);\n    final double pivotValue = sampleData[locations[pivotIndex]];\n    int storeIndex = left;\n    for (int i = left; i &lt;= right; i++) {\n        if (sampleData[locations[i]] &lt;= pivotValue) {\n            final int temp = locations[storeIndex];\n            locations[storeIndex] = locations[i];\n            locations[i] = temp;\n\n            storeIndex++;\n        }\n    }\n    return storeIndex;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Benchmark results are pretty upsetting in this case:</p>\n\n<pre><code>CounterBenchmark.testQuickSelect  thrpt    2   11586,761          ops/s\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":2636896,"reputation":874,"user_id":2281318,"accept_rate":70,"display_name":"Antoine"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1457,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":39207582,"answer_count":3,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1653214863,"creation_date":1472470463,"question_id":39205325,"body_markdown":"I have an array of elements (in the example, these are simply integers), which are compared using some custom comparator.

Unreachable Statements](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se9/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.21) defines the following:\r\n\r\n&gt; * A `while` statement can complete normally iff at least one of the following is true:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;     - The while statement is reachable and the condition expression is not a constant expression (&#167;15.28) with value `true`.\r\n&gt;     - There is a reachable `break` statement that exits the `while` statement.\r\n\r\n*(&quot;iff&quot; means &quot;if and only if&quot;, as defined in chapter 14.21 and explained in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if)*\r\n\r\nThe first condition is false in our case as we have the condition expression `true` for the `while` loop. Notice that this section defines that a `while` loop with `while(true) {...}` without any `break` statements will not &quot;complete normally&quot;.\r\n\r\nNow we need to check if there is a &quot;reachable&quot; `break` statement.\r\nThe `break` statement is &quot;reachable&quot; because of the following chain:\r\n\r\n&gt; * The block that is the body of a constructor, method, instance initializer, or static initializer is reachable.\r\n\r\nThe `{...}` block of the method.\r\n\r\n&gt; The first statement in a non-empty block that is not a switch block is reachable iff the block is reachable.\r\n\r\nSo the `while` loop is reachable.\r\n\r\n&gt; The contained statement is reachable iff the while statement is reachable and the condition expression is not a constant expression whose value is `false`.\r\n\r\nAs the `while` loop is reachable and the condition expression is not `false`, the inner block `{...}` of the `while` statement is reachable. The `if()` statement inside the `{...}` block is reachable again because it is the first statement in a reachable block (see above).\r\n\r\n&gt; The then-statement is reachable iff the if-then statement is reachable.\r\n\r\nThe `{...}` block of the if-statement is reachable, so is the first statement `break` of that block (see above).\r\n\r\nNotice that the condition of the `if()` statement is not checked during this analysis of the compiler (as indicated in the non-normative section at the bottom of chapter 14.21).\r\n\r\nThis whole &quot;reachable&quot; checks means that the `while` loop can complete normally. This means that the `{...}` block of the method can complete normally, see chapter [14.2. Blocks](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se9/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.2):\r\n\r\n&gt; If all of these block statements complete normally, then the block completes normally\r\n\r\nAnd that means that a `return` statement is required, as chapter [8.4.7. Method Body](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se9/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.7) defines it:\r\n\r\n&gt; If a method is declared to have a return type (&#167;8.4.5), then a compile-time error occurs if the body of the method can complete normally (&#167;14.1).\r\n\r\nTherefore, you need a `return` statement, even though you have a `break` statement which cannot be executed. But having the reachable `break` statement there changes everything.

Use SDKv2.\r\nI have seen a lot of times when AWS SDKv1 and v2 are completely incompatible. Migration from v1 to v2 can be easy but sometimes API changes are so huge that you simply cannot find the corresponding method in V2. But if you can then you better do so. V2 introduces a lot of performance improvements so it’s a rule of thumb “If it’s possible then use V2 whenever you can”\r\n\r\n2. Using defined credentials provider.\r\nAWS SDK has quite an interesting way of detecting the credentials. It passes multiple steps trying to figure out the proper credentials until it finds or fails to find any. \r\n\r\n - Java system properties \r\n - Environment variables\r\n - Web identity token from AWS STS \r\n - The shared credentials and config files \r\n - Amazon ECS container credentials\r\n - Amazon EC2 instance profile credentials\r\n\r\nAll these steps take time and you save some milliseconds by specifying exact credentials providers. Like this: \r\n\r\n```\r\nS3Client client = S3Client.builder()\r\n       .credentialsProvider(EnvironmentVariableCredentialsProvider.create())\r\n       .build();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way SDK wouldn’t traverse all possible sources of creds and immediately detect the correct one. \r\n \r\n3. Initialize everything prior to the execution\r\nSimple advice to follow. You may want to simplify things and put all the initialization into the handler method. Better don’t do this, but try to put as much initialization into the constructor as possible. It may reduce latency for repetitive lambda invocations.\r\n\r\n4. Reduce jar size\r\nTo reduce lambda cold start one of the not obvious advice is to reduce the jar size. Java developers usually don’t care to include a few more libraries to avoid reinventing the wheel. But in the case of lambda, you better take a closer look at your pom.xml and clean everything unnecessary. Cause a bigger jar means a longer cold start.\r\n\r\n5. Avoid using any DI\r\nI don&#39;t think you wanted to use any kind of DI. But in case you do try to avoid it. Lambda&#39;s purpose is to be small and lightweight. And DI will dramatically increase cold start and it doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to wire up 2-3 classes.\r\n\r\n6. Use Tiered compilation\r\nJava Just in time compilation has such a cool feature as a tiered compilation introduced since Java 8 was released. The purpose of JIT is to run the code and eventually reach the native code performance. It cannot be done immediately. But running the code and analyzing the hot spots JIT eventually interprets code almost as good as native. This can be achieved by collecting the profiling information in the background. This makes sense with your monolith application running in a servlet container for ages. But short-lived Lambda cannot benefit from these optimisations and it’s better to turn it off completely. To do this put these env variables:\r\n[how to put env vars][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor better understanding, I would refer to oracle docs: https://docs.oracle.com/javacomponents/jrockit-hotspot/migration-guide/comp-opt.htm#JRHMG119\r\n\r\n7. Specify Region and HttpClient explicitly \r\nBy default, AWS SDK comes with 3 different HTTP libs supported which are apache, netty and the built-in JDK HTTP client. Apache and Netty have a lot of features that standard built-in doesn’t have but we have to reduce cold start so prefer using built-in and excluding two others to keep less dependency on the resulting jar.\r\n```\r\n&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;software.amazon.awssdk&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;s3&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;exclusions&gt;\r\n                &lt;exclusion&gt;\r\n                    &lt;groupId&gt;software.amazon.awssdk&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;netty-nio-client&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                &lt;/exclusion&gt;\r\n                &lt;exclusion&gt;\r\n                    &lt;groupId&gt;software.amazon.awssdk&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;apache-client&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                &lt;/exclusion&gt;\r\n            &lt;/exclusions&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n```\r\nAlmost the same situation is with the region. It took some time to figure out the region lambda is deployed and this time can be reduced by specifying the region explicitly. \r\nOverall the resulting configuration should look like: \r\n\r\n```S3Client client = S3Client.builder()\r\n       .region(Region.US_WEST_2)\r\n       .httpClient(UrlConnectionHttpClient.builder().build())\r\n       .build();\r\n```\r\n\r\n8. Use RDS Proxy to have connection pooling\r\nIn case you are planning to use Lambda with RDS then this advice may help you as well otherwise skip it. In “normal” Java applications it is common to use a pool of connections to reuse existing ones and save some time on establishing new ones. RDS Proxy service is coming to the rescue when you are using Lambda.\r\n\r\n9. Increase the memory allocated\r\nSimple yet powerful advice. It can be that your Lambda can run out of memory with the standard 128 Mb allocated. And it seems correct to increase memory in this case.  What is hidden and not obvious is that increasing memory allocated gives your lambda more CPU available. So the combination of increased memory allocated and more virtual CPU power available of course decreases the execution time. Giving your lambda more memory and CPU means increased costs. But less execution time. Instead of guessing which combination is better, I propose to use this tool: https://github.com/alexcasalboni/aws-lambda-power-tuning  \r\n\r\n\r\n10. Use provisioned concurrency\r\nOther guys already mentioned this. Probably the most simple and easy way to solve the problem. But it incurs additional costs.  Provisioned concurrency means AWS will keep execution context ready for you to be used thus decreasing lambda cold start.  You can specify the number of provisioned instances and enjoy lambda being warmed up for you.\r\n\r\nThere is exotic advice to use Graal VM but I think my answer is long enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/TFUZM.png","title":"How to improve performance of initial calls to AWS services from an AWS Lambda (Java)?","body":"<p>Basically, there are a set of recommendations that I am using as a cheat sheet every time I have to optimize lambda performance.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Use SDKv2.\nI have seen a lot of times when AWS SDKv1 and v2 are completely incompatible. Migration from v1 to v2 can be easy but sometimes API changes are so huge that you simply cannot find the corresponding method in V2. But if you can then you better do so. V2 introduces a lot of performance improvements so it’s a rule of thumb “If it’s possible then use V2 whenever you can”</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Using defined credentials provider.\nAWS SDK has quite an interesting way of detecting the credentials. It passes multiple steps trying to figure out the proper credentials until it finds or fails to find any.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Java system properties</li>\n<li>Environment variables</li>\n<li>Web identity token from AWS STS</li>\n<li>The shared credentials and config files</li>\n<li>Amazon ECS container credentials</li>\n<li>Amazon EC2 instance profile credentials</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All these steps take time and you save some milliseconds by specifying exact credentials providers. Like this:</p>\n<pre><code>S3Client client = S3Client.builder()\n       .credentialsProvider(EnvironmentVariableCredentialsProvider.create())\n       .build();\n</code></pre>\n<p>This way SDK wouldn’t traverse all possible sources of creds and immediately detect the correct one.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><p>Initialize everything prior to the execution\nSimple advice to follow. You may want to simplify things and put all the initialization into the handler method. Better don’t do this, but try to put as much initialization into the constructor as possible. It may reduce latency for repetitive lambda invocations.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Reduce jar size\nTo reduce lambda cold start one of the not obvious advice is to reduce the jar size. Java developers usually don’t care to include a few more libraries to avoid reinventing the wheel. But in the case of lambda, you better take a closer look at your pom.xml and clean everything unnecessary.

You can observe all of the changes.\r\n\r\nActivity where you are creating this fragment. To have ViewModel in Fragment, you can use dependency injection (e.g. using Dagger library) or get it from `ViewModelProviders` (or `AndroidViewModelFactory`). \r\n\r\nHere, to make example as simple as possible, I&#39;m passing it via constructor.\r\n\r\n**Activity**\r\n```\r\npublic class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {\r\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\r\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\r\n\r\n        CalculatorWeightedViewModel vm = new CalculatorWeightedViewModel();\r\n\r\n        CalculatorWeightedFragment fragment = new CalculatorWeightedFragment(vm);\r\n\r\n        FragmentTransaction transaction = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();\r\n        transaction.add(R.id.frame_layout, fragment);\r\n        transaction.commit();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**ViewModel**\r\n\r\nYou can store you values (`a`, `b`, `c`) as fieldsfor different purpose. Here, I&#39;m recalculating result live, without any extra fiels. To make it as simple as possible.\r\n```\r\npackage com.example.stack_android;\r\n\r\nimport androidx.lifecycle.LiveData;\r\nimport androidx.lifecycle.MutableLiveData;\r\nimport androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel;\r\n\r\npublic class CalculatorWeightedViewModel extends ViewModel {\r\n\r\n    private MutableLiveData&lt;String&gt; testString = new MutableLiveData&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n    public LiveData&lt;String&gt; takeText() {\r\n        return testString;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void updateValues(double a, double b, double c) {\r\n        double result = recalculate(a, b, c);\r\n        String value = &quot;Result: &quot; + result;\r\n        testString.postValue(value);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void showError() {\r\n        testString.postValue(&quot;Wrong Value&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private double recalculate(double a, double b, double c) {\r\n        return 0.25 * a + 0.25 * b + 0.5 * c;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Fragment:**\r\n\r\nAdditionaly you can create separate listeners (for each of the fields).

<code>LiveData</code> and <code>ViewModel</code>, you no need button in your <code>Fragment</code>. You can observe all of the changes.</p>\n\n<p>Activity where you are creating this fragment. To have ViewModel in Fragment, you can use dependency injection (e.g. using Dagger library) or get it from <code>ViewModelProviders</code> (or <code>AndroidViewModelFactory</code>). </p>\n\n<p>Here, to make example as simple as possible, I'm passing it via constructor.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Activity</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n\n    @Override\n    public void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n\n        CalculatorWeightedViewModel vm = new CalculatorWeightedViewModel();\n\n        CalculatorWeightedFragment fragment = new CalculatorWeightedFragment(vm);\n\n        FragmentTransaction transaction = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();\n        transaction.add(R.id.frame_layout, fragment);\n        transaction.commit();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>ViewModel</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can store you values (<code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>) as fieldsfor different purpose. Here, I'm recalculating result live, without any extra fiels. To make it as simple as possible.</p>\n\n<pre><code>package com.example.stack_android;\n\nimport androidx.lifecycle.LiveData;\nimport androidx.lifecycle.MutableLiveData;\nimport androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel;\n\npublic class CalculatorWeightedViewModel extends ViewModel {\n\n    private MutableLiveData&lt;String&gt; testString = new MutableLiveData&lt;&gt;();\n\n    public LiveData&lt;String&gt; takeText() {\n        return testString;\n    }\n\n    void updateValues(double a, double b, double c) {\n        double result = recalculate(a, b, c);\n        String value = \"Result: \" + result;\n        testString.postValue(value);\n    }\n\n    void showError() {\n        testString.postValue(\"Wrong Value\");\n    }\n\n    private double recalculate(double a, double b, double c) {\n        return 0.25 * a + 0.25 * b + 0.5 * c;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Fragment:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Additionaly you can create separate listeners (for each of the fields).

They are suppose to be recreated every time they are removed or replaced and you are suppose to restore their states using `onSaveInstanceState`.\r\n\r\nHere is a nice article that describes how to do it : [Saving Fragment States][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nOther than that you can use [View Model][2] which is the part of the following recommended android architecture. They are a great way to retain and restore UI data.\r\n\r\nYou can learn how to implement this architecture by following this step by step [code lab][3]\r\n\r\n[![Android recommended architecture][4]][4]\r\n\r\n**EDIT : *Solution*** \r\n\r\n&gt;***Note :** The solution assumes one doesn&#39;t wants to use `ViewModels` and simply wants to hide or show fragments using the Navigation UI*\r\n\r\nIt covers the following points\r\n\r\n - Keeping fragment alive during navigation\r\n - Implement custom navigation behavior on back key press ***(Optional)***\r\n\r\n**Background :**\r\n\r\nAndroid Navigation component has a `NavController` class that you can use to navigate to different destinations. `NavController` uses a `Navigator` that actually does the navigation. `Navigator` is an abstract class and anyone can extend/inherit it to provide custom navigation depending on the type of destination. When using fragments as destinations the `NavHostFragment` uses a `FragmentNavigator` whose default implementation replaces the fragments whenever we navigate using `FragmentTransaction.replace()` which completely destroys the previous fragment and adds a new fragment. So we have to create our own navigator and instead of using `FragmentTransaction.replace()` we will use a combination of `FragmentTransaction.hide()` and `FragmentTransaction.show()` to avoid fragments from being destroyed.\r\n\r\n**Default behavior of Navigation UI :**\r\n\r\nBy default whenever you navigate to any other fragment other than the home fragment they won&#39;t get added to backstack so lets say if you select fragments in the following order \r\n\r\n    A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; E\r\nyour back stack will have only \r\n\r\n    [A, E]\r\n\r\nas you can see the fragments B, C, D weren&#39;t added to backstack so pressing back press will always get you to fragment A which is the home fragment\r\n\r\n**The behavior we want for now :**\r\n\r\nWe want a simple yet effective behavior. We wan&#39;t all fragments to get added to backstack but if the fragment is already in backstack we want to pop all fragments upto the selected fragment.\r\n\r\nLets say I select fragment in following order\r\n\r\n    A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; E\r\n\r\nthe backstack should also be \r\n\r\n    [A, B, C, D, E]\r\n\r\nupon pressing back only the last fragment should be popped and backstack should be like this\r\n\r\n    [A, B, C, D]\r\n\r\nbut if we navigate to lets say fragment B, since B is already in the stack then all the fragments above B should be popped and our backstack should look like this\r\n\r\n     [A, B]\r\n\r\nI hope this behavior makes sense. This behavior is easy to implement using global actions as you will see below and is better than the default one.\r\n\r\n\r\n**OK Hotshot! now what ? :** \r\n\r\nNow we have two options \r\n\r\n 1. extend `FragmentNavigator`\r\n 2. copy/paste `FragmentNavigator`\r\n\r\nWell I personally wanted to just extend `FragmentNavigator` and override `navigate()` method but since all its member variables are private I couldn&#39;t implement proper navigation.\r\n\r\nSo I decided to copy paste the entire `FragmentNavigator` class and just change the name in entire code from *&quot;FragmentNavigator&quot;* to whatever I want to call it.\r\n\r\n**JUST SHOW ME THE STEPS ALREADY !!! :**\r\n\r\n 1. Create custom navigator\r\n 2. Use custom tag\r\n 3. Add global actions\r\n 4. Use global actions\r\n 5. Add the custom navigator to the NavController\r\n\r\n**STEP 1: Create custom navigator** \r\n\r\nHere is my custom navigator called `StickyCustomNavigator`. All the code is same as `FragmentNavigator` except the `navigate()` method. As you can see it uses `hide()` , `show()` and `add()` method instead of `replace()`. The logic is simple. Hide the previous fragment and show the destination fragment. If this is our first time going to a specific destination fragment then add the fragment instead of showing it.\r\n\r\n    @Navigator.Name(&quot;sticky_fragment&quot;)\r\n    public class StickyFragmentNavigator extends Navigator&lt;StickyFragmentNavigator.Destination&gt;

Set global action on each fragment with the following settings\r\n\r\n - destination : self\r\n - popUpTo : self\r\n - singleTop : true/checked\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][5]][5]\r\n[![enter image description here][6]][6]\r\n\r\nThis your how your `navigation.xml` should look like after adding global actions\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n    &lt;navigation xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;\r\n        xmlns:app=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto&quot;\r\n        xmlns:tools=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/tools&quot;\r\n        android:id=&quot;@+id/mobile_navigation&quot;\r\n        app:startDestination=&quot;@+id/navigation_home&quot;&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;sticky_fragment\r\n            android:id=&quot;@+id/navigation_home&quot;\r\n            android:name=&quot;com.example.bottomnavigationlogic.ui.home.HomeFragment&quot;\r\n            android:label=&quot;@string/title_home&quot;\r\n            tools:layout=&quot;@layout/fragment_home&quot; /&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;sticky_fragment\r\n            android:id=&quot;@+id/navigation_images&quot;\r\n            android:name=&quot;com.example.bottomnavigationlogic.ui.images.ImagesFragment&quot;\r\n            android:label=&quot;@string/title_images&quot;\r\n            tools:layout=&quot;@layout/fragment_images&quot; /&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;sticky_fragment\r\n            android:id=&quot;@+id/navigation_videos&quot;\r\n            android:name=&quot;com.example.bottomnavigationlogic.ui.videos.VideosFragment&quot;\r\n            android:label=&quot;@string/title_videos&quot;\r\n            tools:layout=&quot;@layout/fragment_videos&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;sticky_fragment\r\n            android:id=&quot;@+id/navigation_songs&quot;\r\n            android:name=&quot;com.example.bottomnavigationlogic.ui.songs.SongsFragment&quot;\r\n            android:label=&quot;@string/title_songs&quot;\r\n            tools:layout=&quot;@layout/fragment_songs&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;sticky_fragment\r\n            android:id=&quot;@+id/navigation_notifications&quot;\r\n            android:name=&quot;com.example.bottomnavigationlogic.ui.notifications.NotificationsFragment&quot;\r\n            android:label=&quot;@string/title_notifications&quot;\r\n            tools:layout=&quot;@layout/fragment_notifications&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;action\r\n            android:id=&quot;@+id/action_global_navigation_home&quot;\r\n            app:destination=&quot;@id/navigation_home&quot;\r\n            app:launchSingleTop=&quot;true&quot;\r\n            app:popUpTo=&quot;@id/navigation_home&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;action\r\n            android:id=&quot;@+id/action_global_navigation_notifications&quot;\r\n            app:destination=&quot;@id/navigation_notifications&quot;\r\n            app:launchSingleTop=&quot;true&quot;\r\n            app:popUpTo=&quot;@id/navigation_notifications&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;action\r\n            android:id=&quot;@+id/action_global_navigation_songs&quot;\r\n            app:destination=&quot;@id/navigation_songs&quot;\r\n            app:launchSingleTop=&quot;true&quot;\r\n            app:popUpTo=&quot;@id/navigation_songs&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;action\r\n            android:id=&quot;@+id/action_global_navigation_videos&quot;\r\n            app:destination=&quot;@id/navigation_videos&quot;\r\n            app:launchSingleTop=&quot;true&quot;\r\n            app:popUpTo=&quot;@id/navigation_videos&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/navigation&gt;\r\n\r\n**STEP 4: Use global actions**\r\n\r\nWhen you wrote\r\n\r\n     NavigationUI.setupWithNavController (bottomNavigationView, navHostFragment.getNavController ());\r\n\r\nthen inside `setupWithNavController()` NavigationUI uses `bottomNavigationView.setOnNavigationItemSelectedListener()` to navigate to proper fragments depending on id of the menu item that was clicked. It&#39;s default behavior is as I mentioned before. We will add our own implementation to it and use global actions to achieve our desired back press behavior.\r\n\r\nHere is how you do it simply in `MainActivity`\r\n\r\n     bottomNavigationView.setOnNavigationItemSelectedListener(new BottomNavigationView.OnNavigationItemSelectedListener() {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public boolean onNavigationItemSelected(@NonNull MenuItem menuItem) {\r\n                    int id = menuItem.getItemId();\r\n                    if (menuItem.isChecked()) return false;\r\n    \r\n                    switch (id)\r\n                    {\r\n                        case R.id.navigation_home :\r\n                            navController.navigate(R.id.action_global_navigation_home);\r\n                            break;\r\n                        case R.id.navigation_images :\r\n                            navController.navigate(R.id.action_global_navigation_images);\r\n                            break;\r\n                        case R.id.navigation_videos :\r\n                            navController.navigate(R.id.action_global_navigation_videos);\r\n                            break;\r\n                        case R.id.navigation_songs :\r\n                            navController.navigate(R.id.action_global_navigation_songs);\r\n                            break;\r\n                        case R.id.navigation_notifications :\r\n                            navController.navigate(R.id.action_global_navigation_notifications);\r\n                            break;\r\n                    }\r\n                    return true;\r\n    \r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n\r\n**FINAL STEP 5: Add your custom navigator to NavController**\r\n\r\nAdd your navigator as follow in your MainActivity. Make sure you are passing  `childFragmentManager` of the `NavHostFragment`.\r\n\r\n    navController.getNavigatorProvider().addNavigator(new StickyFragmentNavigator(this, navHostFragment.getChildFragmentManager(),R.id.nav_host_fragment));\r\n\r\nAlso add the navigation graph to `NavController` here as well using `setGraph()` method as shown below.\r\n\r\nThis is how my `MainActivity` looks like after **step 4** and **step 5**\r\n\r\n    public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\r\n        \r\n        @Override\r\n        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\r\n            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\r\n            setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\r\n            BottomNavigationView navView = findViewById(R.id.nav_view);\r\n           \r\n            AppBarConfiguration appBarConfiguration = new AppBarConfiguration.Builder(\r\n                    R.id.navigation_home, R.id.navigation_images, R.id.navigation_videos,R.id.navigation_songs,R.id.navigation_notifications)\r\n                    .build();\r\n            NavHostFragment navHostFragment = (NavHostFragment)getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.nav_host_fragment);\r\n            \r\n            final NavController navController = Navigation.findNavController(this, R.id.nav_host_fragment);\r\n            navController.getNavigatorProvider().addNavigator(new StickyFragmentNavigator(this, navHostFragment.getChildFragmentManager(),R.id.nav_host_fragment));\r\n            navController.setGraph(R.navigation.mobile_navigation);\r\n            \r\n            NavigationUI.setupActionBarWithNavController(this, navController, appBarConfiguration);\r\n            NavigationUI.setupWithNavController(navView,navController);\r\n            \r\n            navView.setOnNavigationItemSelectedListener(new BottomNavigationView.OnNavigationItemSelectedListener() {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public boolean onNavigationItemSelected(@NonNull MenuItem menuItem) {\r\n                    int id = menuItem.getItemId();\r\n                    if (menuItem.isChecked()) return false;\r\n    \r\n                    switch (id)\r\n                    {\r\n                        case R.id.navigation_home :\r\n                            navController.navigate(R.id.action_global_navigation_home);\r\n                            break;\r\n                        case R.id.navigation_images :\r\n                            navController.navigate(R.id.action_global_navigation_images);\r\n                            break;\r\n                        case R.id.navigation_videos :\r\n                            navController.navigate(R.id.action_global_navigation_videos);\r\n                            break;\r\n                        case R.id.navigation_songs :\r\n                            navController.navigate(R.id.action_global_navigation_songs);\r\n                            break;\r\n                        case R.id.navigation_notifications :\r\n                            navController.navigate(R.id.action_global_navigation_notifications);\r\n                            break;\r\n                    }\r\n                    return true;\r\n    \r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://evanhalley.dev/post/saving-fragment-states/\r\n  [2]: https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3bKX-pmm5gIVyOFRCh0-Zg6EEAAYASAAEgLhsPD_BwE\r\n  [3]: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-training-livedata-viewmodel/#0\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/TqEV1.png\r\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/5UwZh.jpg\r\n  [6]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Ywyk.jpg","title":"My fragments keep recreating whenever I reclick or navigate to the next fragment","body":"<blockquote>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> skip to the <em><strong>JUST SHOW ME THE STEPS ALREADY !!!</strong></em> section</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is the normal behaviour of the fragments.

When using fragments as destinations the <code>NavHostFragment</code> uses a <code>FragmentNavigator</code> whose default implementation replaces the fragments whenever we navigate using <code>FragmentTransaction.replace()</code> which completely destroys the previous fragment and adds a new fragment. So we have to create our own navigator and instead of using <code>FragmentTransaction.replace()</code> we will use a combination of <code>FragmentTransaction.hide()</code> and <code>FragmentTransaction.show()</code> to avoid fragments from being destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Default behavior of Navigation UI :</strong></p>\n<p>By default whenever you navigate to any other fragment other than the home fragment they won't get added to backstack so lets say if you select fragments in the following order</p>\n<pre><code>A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; E\n</code></pre>\n<p>your back stack will have only</p>\n<pre><code>[A, E]\n</code></pre>\n<p>as you can see the fragments B, C, D weren't added to backstack so pressing back press will always get you to fragment A which is the home fragment</p>\n<p><strong>The behavior we want for now :</strong></p>\n<p>We want a simple yet effective behavior. We wan't all fragments to get added to backstack but if the fragment is already in backstack we want to pop all fragments upto the selected fragment.</p>\n<p>Lets say I select fragment in following order</p>\n<pre><code>A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D -&gt; E\n</code></pre>\n<p>the backstack should also be</p>\n<pre><code>[A, B, C, D, E]\n</code></pre>\n<p>upon pressing back only the last fragment should be popped and backstack should be like this</p>\n<pre><code>[A, B, C, D]\n</code></pre>\n<p>but if we navigate to lets say fragment B, since B is already in the stack then all the fragments above B should be popped and our backstack should look like this</p>\n<pre><code> [A, B]\n</code></pre>\n<p>I hope this behavior makes sense. This behavior is easy to implement using global actions as you will see below and is better than the default one.</p>\n<p><strong>OK Hotshot! now what ? :</strong></p>\n<p>Now we have two options</p>\n<ol>\n<li>extend <code>FragmentNavigator</code></li>\n<li>copy/paste <code>FragmentNavigator</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Well I personally wanted to just extend <code>FragmentNavigator</code> and override <code>navigate()</code> method but since all its member variables are private I couldn't implement proper navigation.</p>\n<p>So I decided to copy paste the entire <code>FragmentNavigator</code> class and just change the name in entire code from <em>&quot;FragmentNavigator&quot;</em> to whatever I want to call it.</p>\n<p><strong>JUST SHOW ME THE STEPS ALREADY !!! :</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create custom navigator</li>\n<li>Use custom tag</li>\n<li>Add global actions</li>\n<li>Use global actions</li>\n<li>Add the custom navigator to the NavController</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>STEP 1: Create custom navigator</strong></p>\n<p>Here is my custom navigator called <code>StickyCustomNavigator</code>. All the code is same as <code>FragmentNavigator</code> except the <code>navigate()</code> method. As you can see it uses <code>hide()</code> , <code>show()</code> and <code>add()</code> method instead of <code>replace()</code>. The logic is simple. Hide the previous fragment and show the destination fragment. If this is our first time going to a specific destination fragment then add the fragment instead of showing it.</p>\n<pre><code>@Navigator.Name(&quot;sticky_fragment&quot;)\npublic class StickyFragmentNavigator extends Navigator&lt;StickyFragmentNavigator.Destination&gt; {\n\n\n    private static final String TAG = &quot;StickyFragmentNavigator&quot;;\n    private static final String KEY_BACK_STACK_IDS = &quot;androidx-nav-fragment:navigator:backStackIds&quot;;\n\n    private final Context mContext;\n    @SuppressWarnings(&quot;WeakerAccess&quot;) /* synthetic access */\n    final FragmentManager mFragmentManager;\n    private final int mContainerId;\n    @SuppressWarnings(&quot;WeakerAccess&quot;) /* synthetic access */\n            ArrayDeque&lt;Integer&gt; mBackStack = new ArrayDeque&lt;&gt;();\n    @SuppressWarnings(&quot;WeakerAccess&quot;) /* synthetic access */\n            boolean mIsPendingBackStackOperation = false;\n\n    private final FragmentManager.OnBackStackChangedListener mOnBackStackChangedListener =\n            new FragmentManager.OnBackStackChangedListener() {\n\n                @SuppressLint(&quot;RestrictedApi&quot;)\n                @Override\n                public void onBackStackChanged() {\n                    // If we have pending operations made by us then consume this change, otherwise\n                    // detect a pop in the back stack to dispatch callback.\n                    if (mIsPendingBackStackOperation) {\n                        mIsPendingBackStackOperation = !isBackStackEqual();\n                        return;\n                    }\n\n                    // The initial Fragment won't be on the back stack, so the\n                    // real count of destinations is the back stack entry count + 1\n                    int newCount = mFragmentManager.getBackStackEntryCount() + 1;\n                    if (newCount &lt; mBackStack.size()) {\n                        // Handle cases where the user hit the system back button\n                        while (mBackStack.size() &gt; newCount) {\n                            mBackStack.removeLast();\n                        }\n                        dispatchOnNavigatorBackPress();\n                    }\n                }\n            };\n\n    public StickyFragmentNavigator(@NonNull Context context, @NonNull FragmentManager manager,\n                           int containerId) {\n        mContext = context;\n        mFragmentManager = manager;\n        mContainerId = containerId;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onBackPressAdded() {\n        mFragmentManager.addOnBackStackChangedListener(mOnBackStackChangedListener);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onBackPressRemoved() {\n        mFragmentManager.removeOnBackStackChangedListener(mOnBackStackChangedListener);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean popBackStack() {\n        if (mBackStack.isEmpty()) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        if (mFragmentManager.isStateSaved()) {\n            Log.i(TAG, &quot;Ignoring popBackStack() call: FragmentManager has already&quot;\n                    + &quot; saved its state&quot;);\n            return false;\n        }\n        if (mFragmentManager.getBackStackEntryCount() &gt; 0) {\n            mFragmentManager.popBackStack(\n                    generateBackStackName(mBackStack.size(), mBackStack.peekLast()),\n                    FragmentManager.POP_BACK_STACK_INCLUSIVE);\n            mIsPendingBackStackOperation = true;\n        } // else, we're on the first Fragment, so there's nothing to pop from FragmentManager\n        mBackStack.removeLast();\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    @NonNull\n    @Override\n    public StickyFragmentNavigator.Destination createDestination() {\n        return new StickyFragmentNavigator.Destination(this);\n    }\n\n    @NonNull\n    public Fragment instantiateFragment(@NonNull Context context,\n                                        @SuppressWarnings(&quot;unused&quot;) @NonNull FragmentManager fragmentManager,\n                                        @NonNull String className, @Nullable Bundle args) {\n        return Fragment.instantiate(context, className, args);\n    }\n\n    @Nullable\n    @Override\n    public NavDestination navigate(@NonNull StickyFragmentNavigator.Destination destination, @Nullable Bundle args,\n                                   @Nullable NavOptions navOptions, @Nullable Navigator.Extras navigatorExtras) {\n        if (mFragmentManager.isStateSaved()) {\n            Log.i(TAG, &quot;Ignoring navigate() call: FragmentManager has already&quot;\n                    + &quot; saved its state&quot;);\n            return null;\n        }\n        String className = destination.getClassName();\n        if (className.charAt(0) == '.') {\n            className = mContext.getPackageName() + className;\n        }\n\n        final FragmentTransaction ft = mFragmentManager.beginTransaction();\n\n        int enterAnim = navOptions != null ?

Is there a way of achieving this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","mybatis"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1085259,"reputation":78314,"user_id":1081110,"display_name":"Dawood ibn Kareem"},"score":0,"creation_date":1653194062,"post_id":72334811,"comment_id":127789229,"body_markdown":"Are you saying you want a singleton list?

The code basically pushes all indexes into the stack, and when the current temperature is greater than one on top of the stack, you remove it and mark the answer for that index, which is <code>i - index</code> (current day - older day with lower temperature).</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":25355176,"reputation":1,"user_id":19171426,"display_name":"Himanshu Ranjan"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1653186575,"creation_date":1653186441,"answer_id":72334392,"question_id":56027810,"body_markdown":"The pop() operation would give you index value only if you define your stack to store it.\r\n\r\n#your declaration of stack. \r\n\r\nStack &lt; Integer &gt; stack = new Stack();\r\n\r\n#expected declaration of stack to store both value and index. \r\n \r\nStack&lt;Integer[]&gt; stack=new Stack();\r\n\r\nAs the dataType of your stack now is an Integer Array, while doing the push operation you can store the index as well as value. \r\n\r\nalso to mention, the pop() operation will now give an Integer[] as return value.
