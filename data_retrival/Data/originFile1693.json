But any given object in Java is likely to have *multiple types.* Some of these types are obviously given by the class hierarchy, others are not so obvious (i.e. generics, arrays).\r\n\r\nSpecifically for reference types, the class hierarchy dictates the subtyping rules. For instance in your example *all trucks are heavy vehicles*, and *all heavy vehicles are vehicle*s. Therefore, this hierarchy of is-a relationships dictates that a truck has *multiple compatible types*.\r\n\r\nWhen we create a `Truck`, we define a &quot;reference&quot; to get access to it. This reference must have one of those compatible types. \r\n\r\n    Truck t = new Truck(); //or\r\n    HeavyVehicle hv = new Truck(); //or\r\n    Vehicle h = new Truck() //or\r\n    Object o = new Truck();\r\n\r\nSo the key point here is the realization that *the reference to the object is not the object itself*. The nature of the object being created is never going to change. But we can use different kinds of compatible references to gain access to the object. This is one of the features of polymorphism here. The same object may be accessed through references of different &quot;compatible&quot; types. \r\n\r\nWhen we do any kind of casting, we are simply assuming the nature of this compatibility between different types of references.\r\n\r\n**Upcasting or Widening Reference Conversion**\r\n\r\nNow, having a reference of type `Truck`, we can easily conclude that it&#39;s always compatible with a reference of type `Vehicle`, because *all Trucks are Vehicles*. Therefore, we could upcast the reference, without using an explicit cast.\r\n\r\n    Truck t = new Truck();\r\n    Vehicle v = t;\r\n\r\nIt is also called a [widening reference conversion](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.5), basically because as you go up in the type hierarchy, the type gets more general. \r\n\r\nYou could use an explicit cast here if you wanted, but it would be unnecessary. We can see that the actual object being referenced by `t` and `v` is the same. It is, and will always be a `Truck`.\r\n\r\n**Downcasting or Narrowing Reference Conversion**\r\n\r\nNow, having a reference of type `Vechicle` we cannot &quot;safely&quot; conclude that it actually references a `Truck`. After all it may also reference some other form of Vehicle. For instance\r\n\r\n    Vehicle v = new Sedan(); //a light vehicle\r\n\r\nIf you find the `v` reference somewhere in your code without knowing to which specific object it is referencing, you cannot &quot;safely&quot; argument whether it points to a `Truck` or to a `Sedan` or any other kind of vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe compiler knows well that it cannot give any guarantees about the true nature of the object being referenced. But the programmer, by reading the code, may be sure of what s/he is doing. Like in the case above, you can clearly see that `Vehicle v` is referencing a `Sedan`.\r\n\r\nIn those cases, we can do a downcast. We call it that way because we are going down the type hierarchy. We also call this a [narrowing reference conversion](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.6). We could say\r\n\r\n    Sedan s = (Sedan) v;\r\n\r\nThis always requires an explicit cast, because the compiler cannot be sure this is safe and that&#39;s why this is like asking the programmer, &quot;are you sure of what you are doing?&quot;. If you lie to the compiler you will throw you a `ClassCastException` at run time, when this code is executed.\r\n\r\n**Other Kinds of Subtyping Rules**\r\n\r\nThere are other rules of subtyping in Java. For instance, there is also a concept called numeric promotion that automatically coerce numbers in expressions. Like in\r\n\r\n    double d = 5 + 6.0;\r\n\r\nIn this case an expression composed of two different types, integer and double, upcasts/coerces the integer to a double before evaluating the expression, resulting in a double value.\r\n\r\nYou may also do primitive upcasting and downcasting. As in\r\n\r\n    int a = 10;\r\n    double b = a; //upcasting\r\n    int c = (int) b; //downcasting\r\n\r\nIn these cases, an explicit cast is required when information can be lost. \r\n\r\nSome subtyping rules may not be so evident, like in the cases of arrays. For instance, all reference arrays are subtypes of `Object[]`, but primitive arrays are not.\r\n\r\nAnd in the case of generics, particularly with the use of wildcards like `super` and `extends`, things get even more complicated. Like in\r\n\r\n    List&lt;Integer&gt; a = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    List&lt;? extends Number&gt; b = a;\r\n    \t\t\r\n    List&lt;Object&gt; c = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); \r\n    List&lt;? super Number&gt; d = c;\r\n\r\nWhere the type of `a` is a subtype of the type of `b`. And the type of `c` is a subtype of the type of `d`.\r\n\r\nUsing covariance, wherever `List&lt;? extends Number&gt;` appears you can pass a `List&lt;Integer&gt;`, therefore `List&lt;Integer&gt;` is a subtype of `List&lt;? extends Number&gt;`.\r\n\r\nContravariance produce a similar effect and wherever the type `List&lt;? super Number&gt;` appears, you could pass a `List&lt;Object&gt;`, which makes of `List&lt;Object&gt;` a subtype of `List&lt;? super Number&gt;`.\r\n\r\nAnd also boxing and unboxing are subject to some casting rules (yet again this is also some form of coercion in my opinion).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-10.html\r\n  [2]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12806739/is-an-array-a-primitive-type-or-an-object-or-something-else-entirely","title":"Explicit type casting example in Java","body":"<p><strong>Reference vs Object vs Types</strong></p>\n<p>The key, for me, is understanding the difference between an object and its references, or put in other words the difference between an object and its types.</p>\n<p>When we create an object in Java, we declare its true nature, which will never change (e.g. <code>new Truck()</code>). But any given object in Java is likely to have <em>multiple types.</em> Some of these types are obviously given by the class hierarchy, others are not so obvious (i.e. generics, arrays).</p>\n<p>Specifically for reference types, the class hierarchy dictates the subtyping rules. For instance in your example <em>all trucks are heavy vehicles</em>, and <em>all heavy vehicles are vehicle</em>s. Therefore, this hierarchy of is-a relationships dictates that a truck has <em>multiple compatible types</em>.</p>\n<p>When we create a <code>Truck</code>, we define a &quot;reference&quot; to get access to it. This reference must have one of those compatible types.</p>\n<pre><code>Truck t = new Truck(); //or\nHeavyVehicle hv = new Truck(); //or\nVehicle h = new Truck() //or\nObject o = new Truck();\n</code></pre>\n<p>So the key point here is the realization that <em>the reference to the object is not the object itself</em>. The nature of the object being created is never going to change. But we can use different kinds of compatible references to gain access to the object. This is one of the features of polymorphism here. The same object may be accessed through references of different &quot;compatible&quot; types.</p>\n<p>When we do any kind of casting, we are simply assuming the nature of this compatibility between different types of references.</p>\n<p><strong>Upcasting or Widening Reference Conversion</strong></p>\n<p>Now, having a reference of type <code>Truck</code>, we can easily conclude that it's always compatible with a reference of type <code>Vehicle</code>, because <em>all Trucks are Vehicles</em>. Therefore, we could upcast the reference, without using an explicit cast.</p>\n<pre><code>Truck t = new Truck();\nVehicle v = t;\n</code></pre>\n<p>It is also called a <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">widening reference conversion</a>, basically because as you go up in the type hierarchy, the type gets more general.</p>\n<p>You could use an explicit cast here if you wanted, but it would be unnecessary. We can see that the actual object being referenced by <code>t</code> and <code>v</code> is the same. It is, and will always be a <code>Truck</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Downcasting or Narrowing Reference Conversion</strong></p>\n<p>Now, having a reference of type <code>Vechicle</code> we cannot &quot;safely&quot; conclude that it actually references a <code>Truck</code>. After all it may also reference some other form of Vehicle. For instance</p>\n<pre><code>Vehicle v = new Sedan(); //a light vehicle\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you find the <code>v</code> reference somewhere in your code without knowing to which specific object it is referencing, you cannot &quot;safely&quot; argument whether it points to a <code>Truck</code> or to a <code>Sedan</code> or any other kind of vehicle.</p>\n<p>The compiler knows well that it cannot give any guarantees about the true nature of the object being referenced. But the programmer, by reading the code, may be sure of what s/he is doing. Like in the case above, you can clearly see that <code>Vehicle v</code> is referencing a <code>Sedan</code>.</p>\n<p>In those cases, we can do a downcast. We call it that way because we are going down the type hierarchy. We also call this a <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">narrowing reference conversion</a>. We could say</p>\n<pre><code>Sedan s = (Sedan) v;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This always requires an explicit cast, because the compiler cannot be sure this is safe and that's why this is like asking the programmer, &quot;are you sure of what you are doing?&quot;. If you lie to the compiler you will throw you a <code>ClassCastException</code> at run time, when this code is executed.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Kinds of Subtyping Rules</strong></p>\n<p>There are other rules of subtyping in Java. For instance, there is also a concept called numeric promotion that automatically coerce numbers in expressions. Like in</p>\n<pre><code>double d = 5 + 6.0;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case an expression composed of two different types, integer and double, upcasts/coerces the integer to a double before evaluating the expression, resulting in a double value.</p>\n<p>You may also do primitive upcasting and downcasting. As in</p>\n<pre><code>int a = 10;\ndouble b = a; //upcasting\nint c = (int) b; //downcasting\n</code></pre>\n<p>In these cases, an explicit cast is required when information can be lost.</p>\n<p>Some subtyping rules may not be so evident, like in the cases of arrays. For instance, all reference arrays are subtypes of <code>Object[]</code>, but primitive arrays are not.</p>\n<p>And in the case of generics, particularly with the use of wildcards like <code>super</code> and <code>extends</code>, things get even more complicated. Like in</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; a = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\nList&lt;? extends Number&gt; b = a;\n        \nList&lt;Object&gt; c = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); \nList&lt;? super Number&gt; d = c;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where the type of <code>a</code> is a subtype of the type of <code>b</code>. And the type of <code>c</code> is a subtype of the type of <code>d</code>.</p>\n<p>Using covariance, wherever <code>List&lt;? extends Number&gt;</code> appears you can pass a <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code>, therefore <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> is a subtype of <code>List&lt;? extends Number&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>Contravariance produce a similar effect and wherever the type <code>List&lt;? super Number&gt;</code> appears, you could pass a <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code>, which makes of <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code> a subtype of <code>List&lt;? super Number&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>And also boxing and unboxing are subject to some casting rules (yet again this is also some form of coercion in my opinion).</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3203871,"reputation":306,"user_id":2705342,"display_name":"dshiga"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1385156160,"creation_date":1384980716,"answer_id":20106757,"question_id":20096297,"body_markdown":"The last line of code compiles and runs successfully with no exceptions.

As I understand casting (implicit or explicit) will only change the declared type of object, not the actual type (which shouldn&#39;t ever change, unless you actually assign a new class instance to that object&#39;s field reference). If hv was already assigned an instance of a HeavyVehicle class which is a super class of the Truck class, how can then this field be type cast into a more specific subclass called Truck which extends from the HeavyVehicle class?\r\n\r\nThe way I understand it is that casting serves the purpose of limiting access to certain methods of an object (class instance). Therefore you can&#39;t cast an object as a more specific class which has more methods then the object&#39;s actual assigned class.

Does explicit casting somehow change the actual type of object (not just the declared type), so that this object is no longer an instance of HeavyVehicle class but now becomes an instance of Truck class?","title":"Explicit type casting example in Java","body":"<p>I have come across this example on <a href=\"http://www.javabeginner.com/learn-java/java-object-typecasting\">http://www.javabeginner.com/learn-java/java-object-typecasting</a> and in the part where it talks about explicit type casting there is one example which confuses me.</p>\n\n<p>The example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Vehicle {\n\n    String name;\n    Vehicle() {\n        name = \"Vehicle\";\n    }\n}\n\nclass HeavyVehicle extends Vehicle {\n\n    HeavyVehicle() {\n        name = \"HeavyVehicle\";\n    }\n}\n\nclass Truck extends HeavyVehicle {\n\n    Truck() {\n        name = \"Truck\";\n    }\n}\n\nclass LightVehicle extends Vehicle {\n\n    LightVehicle() {\n        name = \"LightVehicle\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class InstanceOfExample {\n\n    static boolean result;\n    static HeavyVehicle hV = new HeavyVehicle();\n    static Truck T = new Truck();\n    static HeavyVehicle hv2 = null;\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        result = hV instanceof HeavyVehicle;\n        System.out.print(\"hV is an HeavyVehicle: \" + result + \"\\n\");\n        result = T instanceof HeavyVehicle;\n        System.out.print(\"T is an HeavyVehicle: \" + result + \"\\n\");\n        result = hV instanceof Truck;\n        System.out.print(\"hV is a Truck: \" + result + \"\\n\");\n        result = hv2 instanceof HeavyVehicle;\n        System.out.print(\"hv2 is an HeavyVehicle: \" + result + \"\\n\");\n        hV = T; //Sucessful Cast form child to parent\n        T = (Truck) hV; //Sucessful Explicit Cast form parent to child\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the last line where T is assigned the reference hV and typecast as (Truck), why does it say in the comment that this is a Successful Explicit Cast from parent to child? As I understand casting (implicit or explicit) will only change the declared type of object, not the actual type (which shouldn't ever change, unless you actually assign a new class instance to that object's field reference). If hv was already assigned an instance of a HeavyVehicle class which is a super class of the Truck class, how can then this field be type cast into a more specific subclass called Truck which extends from the HeavyVehicle class?</p>\n\n<p>The way I understand it is that casting serves the purpose of limiting access to certain methods of an object (class instance). Therefore you can't cast an object as a more specific class which has more methods then the object's actual assigned class. That means that the object can only be cast as a superclass or the same class as the class from which it was actually instantiated. Is this correct or am I wrong here? I am still learning so I am not sure if this is the correct way of looking at things.</p>\n\n<p>I also understand that this should be an example of downcasting, but I am not sure how this actually works if the actual type doesn't have the methods of the class to which this object is being downcasted.

Meaning, your app is going to be incredibly slow.\r\n* Use optimistic locking. Which means retries.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what optimistic locking means:\r\n\r\nWhen you start the transaction, no other transactions are locked out. Every thread just does its thing. When you `commit()` the transaction, the DB goes back and checks if you were to go back in time and act like you never ran, and then you run every DB statement you&#39;ve run in this transaction again, if you would get the same results, then it&#39;s okay. If you don&#39;t, then the commit fails, indicating back to the code: Just.. do it again. This is called __retry__.\r\n\r\nSounds nuts? Don&#39;t knock it - it powers ethernet and is generally much, much faster than the &#39;lock all the things&#39; approach!\r\n\r\nIn other words, given an ATM and a bank teller in the building, and simultaneously, you run this operation on both sides:\r\n\r\n * User wants €50,-\r\n * start transaction\r\n * Fetch user&#39;s balance\r\n * Subtract 50 euros from it\r\n * Write this adjusted balance back to the DB\r\n * Commit transaction\r\n * Hand over €50,-\r\n\r\nThen __only SERIALIZABLE__ is safe here. Either we lock all the things, or we use optimistic locking. With optimistic locking, they both simultaneously do their thing, but one of them will fail their commit as the &#39;fetch user&#39;s balance&#39; operation would no longer be returning the same result as it did.\r\n\r\nThe solution is that you need to capture __all__ your transactions in a closure block, because your DB &#39;runner&#39; needs to catch the SQLException that means &#39;retry it&#39;, and then start the transaction from the top again. It also means all such code needs to be idempotent (it may run more than once). For example, if you spit out €50,- as part of it, that is not idempotent (spitting out 50,- 10 times in a row is different from doing it once. Contrast to writing &#39;hello&#39; into the same row in a database 10x over and over again - the end result is no different from doing that once). There&#39;s a reason I put the `hand over the 50,-` outside of the transaction - it would be a money-costing bug that can be abused to swindle the bank for millions if you put it inside!\r\n\r\nSo, if you did _not_ start out with SERIALIZABLE, you can&#39;t &#39;just&#39; introduce it, because doing so will either break a ton of stuff (at first, SQLExceptions in the log that should have been addressed by retrying instead, and if you wrap all your db code in loops, problems where the code you wrapped wasn&#39;t idempotent), or make things slow as molasses.\r\n\r\nThe alternatives, however, are tricky. As you discovered, testing that you&#39;ve truly 100% protected your app from ever messing up is very difficult to do (testing concurrency is always very very difficult).

Any help is greatly appreciated. </p>\n\n<p>*Update\nThis exact pattern is suggested <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19231875/choose-which-implementation-to-inject-at-runtime-spring\">here</a>.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","windows","selenium","microsoft-edge","selenium-edgedriver"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":10049107,"reputation":186627,"user_id":7429447,"accept_rate":86,"display_name":"undetected Selenium"},"score":0,"creation_date":1641835981,"post_id":70654026,"comment_id":124905851,"body_markdown":"Majority of the error tracelog sounds _false possitives_ as:  _`SessionNotCreatedException`_ is related to the WebDriver but not to the client.","body":"Majority of the error tracelog sounds <i>false possitives</i> as:  <i><code>SessionNotCreatedException</code></i> is related to the WebDriver but not to the client."}],"owner":{"account_id":23526231,"reputation":11,"user_id":17572723,"display_name":"Ardie Fernandez"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":432,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1641836022,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1641836172,"creation_date":1641825112,"question_id":70654026,"body_markdown":"I have developed a Java app that will automatically download a file from a certain website.

It&#39;s more fundamental than that.\r\n\r\nLet me put that differently: Define &#39;threadsafe&#39;.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example of what can happen in a non-threadsafe implementation:\r\n\r\n* You invoke `.put` on a plain jane `j.u.HashMap`, not holding any locks.\r\n* Simultaneously, a different thread also does that.\r\n* The map is now in a broken state. If you iterate through the elements, the first put statement doesn&#39;t show at all, the second put statement shows up in your iteration, and a completely unrelated key has disappeared. But calling `.get(k)` on that map with the second thread&#39;s key doesn&#39;t find it eventhough it is returned in the `.entrySet()`. This makes no sense and breaks all rules of j.u.HashMap. The spec of hashmap does not explain any of this, other than &#39;I am not threadsafe&#39; and leaves it at that.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s an example of NOT thread safe.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of perfectly fine:\r\n\r\n* 2 threads begin.\r\n* Some external event (e.g. a log) shows that thread 1 is very very very slightly ahead of thread 2, but the notion of &#39;ahead&#39;, if it is relevant, means your code is broken. That&#39;s just not how multicore works.\r\n* Thread 1 adds a thing to a concurrency-capable map, and logs that it has done so.\r\n* Thread 2 logs that it starts an operation. (From the few things you have observed, it seems to be running slightly &#39;later&#39;) so I guess we&#39;re &quot;after&quot; the point where T1 added the thing) now queries for the thing and __does not get a result__.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s fine. That&#39;s still thread safe. Thread safe doesn&#39;t mean every interaction with an instance of that data type can be understood in terms of &#39;first this thing happened, then that thing happened&#39;. Wanting that is __very problematic__, because the only way the computer can really give you that kind of guarantee is to disable all but a single core and run everything very very slowly. The point of a cache is to speed things up, not slow things down!\r\n\r\nThe problem with the lack of guarantees here is that if you run multiple separate operations on the same object, you run into trouble. Here&#39;s some pseudocode for a bank ATM machine that will go epically wrong in the long run:\r\n\r\n* Ask user how much money they want (say, €50,-).\r\n* Retrieve account balance from a &#39;threadsafe&#39; `Map&lt;Account, Integer&gt;` (maps account ID to cents in account).\r\n* Check if €50,-. If no, show error. If yes...\r\n* Spit out €50,-, and update the threadsafe map with `.put(acct, balance - 5000)`.\r\n\r\nEverything perfectly threadsafe. And yet this is going to go very very wrong - if the user uses their card at the same time they are in the bank withdrawing money via the teller, either the bank or the user is going to get very lucky here. I&#39;d hope it&#39;s obvious to see how and why.\r\n\r\nThe upshot is: __If you have dependencies between operations there is nothing you can do with &#39;threadsafe&#39; concepts that can possibly fix it; the only way is to actually write code that explicitly marks off these dependencies__.\r\n\r\nThe only way to write that bank code is to either use some form of locking. Basic locking, or optimistic locking, either way is fine, but locking of some sort. It _has_ to look like&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstart some sort of transaction;\r\nfetch account balance;\r\ndeal with insufficient funds;\r\nspit out cash;\r\nupdate account balance;\r\nend transaction;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow guava&#39;s code makes perfect sense:\r\n\r\n* There is no such thing as &#39;earlier&#39; and &#39;later&#39;. You need to stop thinking about multicore in that way. Unless you explicitly write primitives that establish these things. The cache interface _does_ have these. Use the right operation! `getIfPresent` will get you the cache if it is possible for your current thread to get at that data. If it is not, it returns `null`, that&#39;s what that call _does_.\r\n\r\n* If instead you want this common operation: &quot;Get me the cached value. However, if it is not available, then run this code to calculate the cached value, cache the result, and return it to me. In addition, ensure that if 2 threads simultaneously end up running this exact operation, only one thread runs the calculation, and the other will wait for the other one (don&#39;t say &#39;first&#39; one, that&#39;s not how you should think about threads) to finish, and use that result instead&quot;.. then, use the right call for that: `.cache.get(key, k -&gt; calculateValueForKey(k))`. As [the docs explicitly call out](https://guava.dev/releases/21.0/api/docs/com/google/common/cache/Cache.html#get-K-java.util.concurrent.Callable-) this will _wait_ for another thread that is _also_ &#39;loading&#39; the value (that&#39;s what guava cache calls the calculation process).\r\n\r\n* No matter what you invoke from the Cache API, you can&#39;t &#39;break it&#39;, in the sense that I broke that HashMap. The cache API does this partly by using locks (such as `ReentrantLock` for mutating operations on it), and partly by using a `ConcurrentHashMap` under the hood.\r\n\r\n[1] Often log frameworks end up injecting an actual explicit lock in the proceedings and thus you do often get guarantees in this case, but only &#39;by accident&#39; because of the log framework. This isn&#39;t a guarantee (maybe you&#39;re logging to separate log files, for example!) and often what you &#39;witness&#39; may be a lie. For example, maybe you have 2 log statements that both log to separate files (and don&#39;t lock each other out at all), and they log the timestamp as part of the log. The fact that one log line says &#39;12:00:05&#39; and the other says &#39;12:00:06&#39; __means nothing__ - the log thread fetches the current time, creates a string describing the message, and tells the OS to write it to the file. You obviously get absolutely no guarantee that the 2 log threads run at identical speed. Maybe one thread fetches the time (12:00:05), creates the string, wants to write to the disk but the OS switches to the other thread before the write goes through, the other thread is the other logger, it reads time (12:00:06), makes the string, writes it out, finishes up, and then the first logger continues, writes its context. Tada: 2 threads where you &#39;observe&#39; one thread is &#39;earlier&#39; but that is incorrect. Perhaps this example will further highlight why thinking about threads in terms of which one is &#39;first&#39; steers you wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] This code has the additional complication that you&#39;re interacting with systems that _cannot_ be transactional. The point of a transaction is that you can abort it; you cannot abort the user grabbing a bill from the ATM. You solve that by logging that you&#39;re about to spit out the money, then spit out the money, then log that you have spit out the money. And finally write to this log that it has been processed in the user&#39;s account balance. Other code needs to check this log and act accordingly. For example, on startup the bank&#39;s DB machine needs to flag &#39;dangling&#39; ATM transactions and will have to get a human to check the video feed. This solves the problem where someone trips over the power cable of the bank DB machine juuust as the user is about to grab the banknote from the machine.\r\n","title":"Is get() thread-safe operation in Guava&#39;s cache?","body":"<p>Even if <code>getIfPresent</code> did use locks, that won't help.

I'd hope it's obvious to see how and why.</p>\n<p>The upshot is: <strong>If you have dependencies between operations there is nothing you can do with 'threadsafe' concepts that can possibly fix it; the only way is to actually write code that explicitly marks off these dependencies</strong>.</p>\n<p>The only way to write that bank code is to either use some form of locking. Basic locking, or optimistic locking, either way is fine, but locking of some sort. It <em>has</em> to look like<sup>2</sup>:</p>\n<pre><code>start some sort of transaction;\nfetch account balance;\ndeal with insufficient funds;\nspit out cash;\nupdate account balance;\nend transaction;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now guava's code makes perfect sense:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>There is no such thing as 'earlier' and 'later'. You need to stop thinking about multicore in that way. Unless you explicitly write primitives that establish these things. The cache interface <em>does</em> have these. Use the right operation! <code>getIfPresent</code> will get you the cache if it is possible for your current thread to get at that data. If it is not, it returns <code>null</code>, that's what that call <em>does</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If instead you want this common operation: &quot;Get me the cached value. However, if it is not available, then run this code to calculate the cached value, cache the result, and return it to me. In addition, ensure that if 2 threads simultaneously end up running this exact operation, only one thread runs the calculation, and the other will wait for the other one (don't say 'first' one, that's not how you should think about threads) to finish, and use that result instead&quot;.. then, use the right call for that: <code>.cache.get(key, k -&gt; calculateValueForKey(k))</code>. As <a href=\"https://guava.dev/releases/21.0/api/docs/com/google/common/cache/Cache.html#get-K-java.util.concurrent.Callable-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the docs explicitly call out</a> this will <em>wait</em> for another thread that is <em>also</em> 'loading' the value (that's what guava cache calls the calculation process).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>No matter what you invoke from the Cache API, you can't 'break it', in the sense that I broke that HashMap. The cache API does this partly by using locks (such as <code>ReentrantLock</code> for mutating operations on it), and partly by using a <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> under the hood.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[1] Often log frameworks end up injecting an actual explicit lock in the proceedings and thus you do often get guarantees in this case, but only 'by accident' because of the log framework. This isn't a guarantee (maybe you're logging to separate log files, for example!) and often what you 'witness' may be a lie. For example, maybe you have 2 log statements that both log to separate files (and don't lock each other out at all), and they log the timestamp as part of the log. The fact that one log line says '12:00:05' and the other says '12:00:06' <strong>means nothing</strong> - the log thread fetches the current time, creates a string describing the message, and tells the OS to write it to the file. You obviously get absolutely no guarantee that the 2 log threads run at identical speed. Maybe one thread fetches the time (12:00:05), creates the string, wants to write to the disk but the OS switches to the other thread before the write goes through, the other thread is the other logger, it reads time (12:00:06), makes the string, writes it out, finishes up, and then the first logger continues, writes its context. Tada: 2 threads where you 'observe' one thread is 'earlier' but that is incorrect. Perhaps this example will further highlight why thinking about threads in terms of which one is 'first' steers you wrong.</p>\n<p>[2] This code has the additional complication that you're interacting with systems that <em>cannot</em> be transactional. The point of a transaction is that you can abort it; you cannot abort the user grabbing a bill from the ATM. You solve that by logging that you're about to spit out the money, then spit out the money, then log that you have spit out the money. And finally write to this log that it has been processed in the user's account balance. Other code needs to check this log and act accordingly. For example, on startup the bank's DB machine needs to flag 'dangling' ATM transactions and will have to get a human to check the video feed. This solves the problem where someone trips over the power cable of the bank DB machine juuust as the user is about to grab the banknote from the machine.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":16435644,"reputation":33,"user_id":17893527,"display_name":"segu"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":3075,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":70655578,"answer_count":2,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1641831452,"creation_date":1641825399,"question_id":70654094,"body_markdown":"I found out that put and get with CacheLoader operations use Reentrant lock under the hood, but why this is not implemented for getIfPresent operation?\r\n\r\nget which is used by getIfPresent\r\n```\r\n@Nullable\r\n        V get(Object key, int hash) {\r\n            try {\r\n                if (this.count != 0) {\r\n                    long now = this.map.ticker.read();\r\n                    ReferenceEntry&lt;K, V&gt; e = this.getLiveEntry(key, hash, now);\r\n                    Object value;\r\n                    if (e == null) {\r\n                        value = null;\r\n                        return value;\r\n                    }\r\n\r\n                    value = e.getValueReference().get();\r\n                    if (value != null) {\r\n                        this.recordRead(e, now);\r\n                        Object var7 = this.scheduleRefresh(e, e.getKey(), hash, value, now, this.map.defaultLoader);\r\n                        return var7;\r\n                    }\r\n\r\n                    this.tryDrainReferenceQueues();\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                Object var11 = null;\r\n                return var11;\r\n            } finally {\r\n                this.postReadCleanup();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nput\r\n```\r\n @Nullable\r\n        V put(K key, int hash, V value, boolean onlyIfAbsent) {\r\n            this.lock();\r\n           .....\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs the only thing I can do to reach thread-safety in basic get/put operations is to use synchronization on client ? \r\n","title":"Is get() thread-safe operation in Guava&#39;s cache?","body":"<p>I found out that put and get with CacheLoader operations use Reentrant lock under the hood, but why this is not implemented for getIfPresent operation?</p>\n<p>get which is used by getIfPresent</p>\n<pre><code>@Nullable\n        V get(Object key, int hash) {\n            try {\n                if (this.count != 0) {\n                    long now = this.map.ticker.read();\n                    ReferenceEntry&lt;K, V&gt; e = this.getLiveEntry(key, hash, now);\n                    Object value;\n                    if (e == null) {\n                        value = null;\n                        return value;\n                    }\n\n                    value = e.getValueReference().get();\n                    if (value != null) {\n                        this.recordRead(e, now);\n                        Object var7 = this.scheduleRefresh(e, e.getKey(), hash, value, now, this.map.defaultLoader);\n                        return var7;\n                    }\n\n                    this.tryDrainReferenceQueues();\n                }\n\n                Object var11 = null;\n                return var11;\n            } finally {\n                this.postReadCleanup();\n            }\n        }\n</code></pre>\n<p>put</p>\n<pre><code> @Nullable\n        V put(K key, int hash, V value, boolean onlyIfAbsent) {\n            this.lock();\n           .....\n</code></pre>\n<p>Is the only thing I can do to reach thread-safety in basic get/put operations is to use synchronization on client ?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","abstract-syntax-tree","jflex","cup"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":9760,"reputation":85859,"user_id":18157,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Jim Garrison"},"score":0,"creation_date":1641589628,"post_id":70627129,"comment_id":124852678,"body_markdown":"There&#39;s not enough information in your post for someone to answer.
