Once I was able to fix it by setting a big timeout (about 300secs) between deleting old topologies and setting up new ones and increased workerShutdownSleepSecs config. In this case, Storm was able to delete all blobs to work fine because I noticed in logs that Storm needed some time to have everything deleted even after topology was completely deleted.\r\n\r\nBut now I faced it again but with all actions above but in a smaller QA environment. Does anybody know what else can cause it?\r\n\r\nAlso in the supervisor machine, I checked the storm data folder and in &quot;/storm/workers&quot; folder I found that there are some old folders with id in their name and I assume that storm did not delete old topologies again.\r\n\r\nI think it should be something very common because storm as I noticed fails almost after everything it tries to do on its own so somebody faced it already I guess.\r\n\r\nMy storm.yaml:\r\n(storm.scheduler: &quot;org.apache.storm.scheduler.resource.ResourceAwareScheduler&quot;

So as I understand I need some config to ask storm to wait about a min before checking the topology state?\r\n\r\nUPD: I faced the same issue but on prod env again already. it seems that it does not depend on slow or fast machines. The logs absolutely the same but the time was different (at 02:15:45 supervisor launched a worker and after 2! secs status was changed &quot;waiting-for-worker-start msInState: 2002 -&gt; kill-blob-update msInState: 0&quot;. But why?\r\nI started to search in the code and I found that in Slot class in handleWaitingForWorkerStart method there is a code as:\r\n```\r\ndynamicState = filterChangingBlobsFor(dynamicState, dynamicState.currentAssignment);\r\nif (!dynamicState.changingBlobs.isEmpty()) {\r\n    //Kill the container and restart it\r\n    return killContainerFor(KillReason.BLOB_CHANGED, dynamicState, staticState);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nDoes not know what changingBlobs collection means (maybe some blobs are being changed) but looks like here status was changed and the worker was marked to be killed. \r\nTimeout is different I think because before in that method it waits for a heartbeat but on different machines it can take more or less time. \r\nSo by what reason supervisor changed the status and why worker started launching itself after supervisor deleted everything related to this worker?","title":"Apache Storm address already in use error","body":"<p>From time to time I have an error in circle like this:</p>\n<pre><code>022-11-07 06:34:30.977 o.a.s.m.n.Server main [INFO] Create Netty Server Netty-server-localhost-6704, buffer_size: 5242880, maxWorkers: 1\n2022-11-07 06:34:31.566 o.a.s.u.Utils main [ERROR] Received error in thread main.. terminating worker...\njava.lang.Error: java.security.PrivilegedActionException: java.net.BindException: Address already in use\n    at org.apache.storm.utils.Utils.handleUncaughtException(Utils.java:663) ~[storm-client-2.4.0.jar:2.4.0]\n    at org.apache.storm.utils.Utils.handleWorkerUncaughtException(Utils.java:671) ~[storm-client-2.4.0.jar:2.4.0]\n    at org.apache.storm.utils.Utils.lambda$createWorkerUncaughtExceptionHandler$3(Utils.java:1058) ~[storm-client-2.4.0.jar:2.4.0]\n    at java.lang.ThreadGroup.uncaughtException(ThreadGroup.java:1055) [?:?]\n    at java.lang.ThreadGroup.uncaughtException(ThreadGroup.java:1050) [?:?]\n    at java.lang.Thread.dispatchUncaughtException(Thread.java:2002) [?:?]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Storm is trying to set up a new topology but it can't.</p>\n<p>I have been facing it for a long period of time after deploying to Storm. Once I was able to fix it by setting a big timeout (about 300secs) between deleting old topologies and setting up new ones and increased workerShutdownSleepSecs config.

So as I understand I need some config to ask storm to wait about a min before checking the topology state?</p>\n<p>UPD: I faced the same issue but on prod env again already. it seems that it does not depend on slow or fast machines. The logs absolutely the same but the time was different (at 02:15:45 supervisor launched a worker and after 2! secs status was changed &quot;waiting-for-worker-start msInState: 2002 -&gt; kill-blob-update msInState: 0&quot;. But why?\nI started to search in the code and I found that in Slot class in handleWaitingForWorkerStart method there is a code as:</p>\n<pre><code>dynamicState = filterChangingBlobsFor(dynamicState, dynamicState.currentAssignment);\nif (!dynamicState.changingBlobs.isEmpty()) {\n    //Kill the container and restart it\n    return killContainerFor(KillReason.BLOB_CHANGED, dynamicState, staticState);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Does not know what changingBlobs collection means (maybe some blobs are being changed) but looks like here status was changed and the worker was marked to be killed.\nTimeout is different I think because before in that method it waits for a heartbeat but on different machines it can take more or less time.\nSo by what reason supervisor changed the status and why worker started launching itself after supervisor deleted everything related to this worker?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","recursion","series"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":39208,"reputation":251240,"user_id":112968,"accept_rate":68,"display_name":"knittl"},"score":0,"creation_date":1674502790,"post_id":75214205,"comment_id":132723692,"body_markdown":"When should it stop?","body":"When should it stop?"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":26495067,"reputation":34,"user_id":20132955,"display_name":"OCEAN OESTREICHER"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1674530105,"creation_date":1674530105,"answer_id":75217099,"question_id":75214205,"body_markdown":"User16320675 has a valid solution for this.

As soon\nas the exponent of the Java double floating point value\nis different from the binary precision, this leads to additional digits and lengthy\npow() operations, which one can verify by inspecting\nsome open source BigDecimal(double)\nconstructor implementation.</p>\n<p>One can get the mantissa via Double.doubleToRawLongBits(d).\nIf the Java double floating point value is not a sub-normal\nall that needs to be done is (raw &amp; DOUBLE_SNIF_MASK) +\n(DOUBLE_SNIF_MASK+1) where 0x000fffffffffffffL This means\nthe integer Java primitive type long should be enough to\ncarry the mantissa. The challenge is now to perform a comparison\ntaking the exponent of the float also into account.</p>\n<p>But I must admit I didn't have time yet to work\nout some Java code. I have also in mind some\noptimizations using bigLength() of the other\nargument, which is in this setting a BigInteger.\nThe use of bitLength() would speed up the comparison.\nA simple heuristic can implement a fast path, so that\nthe mantissa can be ignored.

For example, the [Spring Vault reference manual][1] says:\r\n\r\n&gt; *&quot;Consider carefully your security requirements. Static token authentication is fine if you want quickly get started with Vault, but a static token is not protected any further. Any disclosure to unintended parties allows Vault use with the associated token roles.&quot;*\r\n\r\nYou should either protect your static tokens, or only grant them access to &quot;secrets&quot; in the vault which you are happy to be widely known.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, have your application use an [authenticated method][2] to generate short-term dynamic tokens.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n&gt; As I understand initial problem it is bad to store passwords in an application.properties file on Github.\r\n\r\nAnd storing a static Vault token in an application.properties file on Github is equally as bad.\r\n\r\n&gt; What is the difference ? \r\n\r\nThere is almost no difference&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  This is simply the wrong way to use Vault.\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1 - There is a small advantage in that you could invalidate the token if you discover it leaked by accident.  But this doesn&#39;t mean that it is sensible to publish it deliberately.&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nSo how do you do things securely?\r\n\r\nFirst, you **MUST** secure the machines where the secrets are going to be used.  Even if you are not going to store the actual secrets on disk, you will need to store a different secret (securely) on each of your machines so that they can authenticate themselves to the place where the real secrets are kept.\r\n\r\nHere is an example using Chef.\r\n\r\n1.  Set up a secure Chef server that holds the configs for your machines; i.e. recipes for all of the things that need to be installed, node descriptions to say what recipes to apply, etc.\r\n\r\n2.  When you bootstrap a machine as a node, a keypair is generated for the machine and registered with the Chef server.  The keypair is also held on the machine, and has to be held securely.\r\n\r\n3.  Then you use the Chef client to run the recipes that install and configure your server.\r\n\r\nNote that this relies on having a properly secured system to run the Chef server.  It also relies on each of the nodes being sufficiently secure to protect their own keys.\r\n\r\nThere are other ways to do this, but nothing will work if you cannot secure your host sufficiently.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-vault/reference/html/\r\n  [2]: https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/auth/","title":"How to store secrets of a Spring Boot application in HashiCorp Vault securely?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Could you please explain why it is safe?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The answer is that it is NOT safe ... if you do it that way.

But while output0 works fine, already output1 wont work...</p>\n<pre><code>public void Merge(File folder){\n      \n        File[] liste = folder.listFiles();\n        String path = jTextField1.getText();\n        for(int i = 0; i &lt; liste.length-2; i++){\n            \n      MovieCreator mc = new MovieCreator();\n      try{\n        Movie movie1 = mc.build(liste[i].toString());\n          System.out.println(&quot;Film 1: &quot; + liste[i]);\n        Movie movie2 = mc.build(liste[i+1].toString());\n          System.out.println(&quot;Film 2: &quot; + liste[i+1]);\n          \n        //Fetching the video tracks from the movies and storing them into an array\n        Track[] vetTrackVideo = new Track[0];\n        vetTrackVideo = Stream.of(movie1, movie2)\n                .flatMap(movie -&gt; movie.getTracks().stream())\n                .filter(movie -&gt; movie.getHandler().equals(&quot;vide&quot;))\n                .collect(Collectors.toList())\n                .toArray(vetTrackVideo);\n\n        //Fetching the audio tracks from the movies and storing them into an array\n        Track[] vetTrackAudio = new Track[0];\n        vetTrackAudio = Stream.of(movie1, movie2)\n                .flatMap(movie -&gt; movie.getTracks().stream())\n                .filter(movie -&gt; movie.getHandler().equals(&quot;soun&quot;))\n                .collect(Collectors.toList())\n                .toArray(vetTrackAudio);\n\n        //Creating the output movie by setting a list with both video and audio tracks\n        Movie movieOutput = new Movie();\n        List&lt;Track&gt; listTracks = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(List.of(new AppendTrack(vetTrackVideo), new AppendTrack(vetTrackAudio)));\n        movieOutput.setTracks(listTracks);\n\n        //Building the output movie and storing it into a Container\n        DefaultMp4Builder mp4Builder = new DefaultMp4Builder();\n        Container c = (Container) mp4Builder.build(movieOutput);\n\n        //Writing the output file\n        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(path + &quot;\\\\output&quot; + i + &quot;.mp4&quot;);\n        c.writeContainer(fos.getChannel());\n        fos.close();\n        File f = new File(path + &quot;\\\\output&quot; + i + &quot;.mp4&quot;);\n        liste[i+1] = f;\n              }catch(Exception e2){\n          e2.printStackTrace();\n      }\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","keystore"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":10941198,"reputation":4394,"user_id":8041003,"display_name":"John Williams"},"score":0,"creation_date":1674645898,"post_id":75232860,"comment_id":132757484,"body_markdown":"Is the cert valid/matching - CN, SAN matches hostname, date range?","body":"Is the cert valid/matching - CN, SAN matches hostname, date range?"},{"owner":{"account_id":27452234,"reputation":25,"user_id":20944284,"display_name":"developmentstart"},"score":0,"creation_date":1674646745,"post_id":75232860,"comment_id":132757729,"body_markdown":"I just fixed it by downloading the certificate from their website and importing it into the Java keystore.
