(took more then X ).\r\n\r\nFor that user, you can start adding the ```timeout``` or ```terminate_after``` params that will try to limit the query execution. this wont prevent the user from performing an expansive query, but it will try to cancel long running queries after &#39;timeout&#39; has expired, returning a partial or empty result back to the user. \r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /my-index-000001/_search\r\n{\r\n  &quot;timeout&quot;: &quot;2s&quot;,\r\n  &quot;query&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;match&quot;: {\r\n      &quot;user.id&quot;: &quot;kimchy&quot;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis will limit the affect of the expansive queries on the cluster, performed by that user.\r\n\r\na side-note;

enough to be considered for this aggregation.\r\n\r\n## Searching for keywords in the query\r\nYou stated this as an option as well. the DSL query in the end translates to a REST call with JSON body, so using a JsonNode you could look for specific sub-elements that you &#39;think&#39;

Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n<pre><code>C:\\Project&gt;mvn eclipse:eclipse\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\nDownloading: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/plugins/maven-jar-pl\nugin/2.3.2/maven-jar-plugin-2.3.2.pom\nDownloaded: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/plugins/maven-jar-plu\ngin/2.3.2/maven-jar-plugin-2.3.2.pom (6 KB at 10.9 KB/sec)\nDownloading: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/plugins/maven-plugin\ns/21/maven-plugins-21.pom\nDownloaded: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/plugins/maven-plugins\n/21/maven-plugins-21.pom (13 KB at 27.8 KB/sec)\nDownloading: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/maven-parent/20/mave\nn-parent-20.pom\nDownloaded: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/maven-parent/20/maven\n-parent-20.pom (25 KB at 50.3 KB/sec)\nDownloading: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/plugins/maven-jar-pl\nugin/2.3.2/maven-jar-plugin-2.3.2.jar\nDownloaded: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/plugins/maven-jar-plu\ngin/2.3.2/maven-jar-plugin-2.3.2.jar (32 KB at 71.4 KB/sec)\n[INFO]\n\n[INFO] Building myProject 3.0\n\n[INFO] &gt;&gt;&gt; maven-eclipse-plugin:2.8:eclipse (default-cli) @ myProject &gt;&gt;&gt;\n[WARNING] The artifact commons-email:commons-email:jar:1.1 has been relocated to\norg.apache.commons:commons-email:jar:1.1\n[INFO]\n[INFO] --- xmlbeans-maven-plugin:2.3.3:xmlbeans (default) @ myProject ---\n[INFO] All schema objects are up to date.\n[INFO]\n[INFO] &lt;&lt;&lt; maven-eclipse-plugin:2.8:eclipse (default-cli) @ myProject &lt;&lt;&lt;\n[INFO]\n[INFO] --- maven-eclipse-plugin:2.8:eclipse (default-cli) @ myProject ---\n[INFO] Using Eclipse Workspace: null\n[INFO] Adding default classpath container: org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAIN\nER\n[WARNING] While downloading commons-email:commons-email:1.1\nThis artifact has been relocated to org.apache.commons:commons-email:1.1.\nCommons Email has been reassigned to the\norg.apache.commons group as per the Maven 2 standards.\n\n[INFO] Creating maven-eclipse.xml Ant file to handle resources\n[INFO] Creating external launcher file\n[INFO] File C:\\myProjectProject\\.project already exists.\nAdditional settings will be preserved, run mvn eclipse:clean if you want\nold settings to be removed.\n[INFO] Wrote Eclipse project for \"myProject\" to C:\\myProjectProject.\n\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\n\n[INFO] Total time: 6.823s\n[INFO] Finished at: Tue Mar 13 13:16:52 PDT 2012\n[INFO] Final Memory: 9M/152M\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","apache-camel","sftp","pgp"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":17955680,"reputation":93,"user_id":13047795,"display_name":"Zach"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1666856842,"creation_date":1666856842,"answer_id":74218491,"question_id":74218274,"body_markdown":"Issue was due to lack of knowledge around FTP component\r\nhttps://camel.apache.org/components/3.18.x/ftp-component.html\r\n\r\nWhere it is specified that absolute paths are not supported, unfortunately I did not read this page and only referenced the SFTP component page where it is not specified.\r\nhttps://camel.apache.org/components/3.18.x/sftp-component.html\r\n\r\nIssue was resolved by backtracking directories with /../../ before giving the absolute path.\r\n\r\n","title":"Unable to use apache-camel for sftp file transfer","body":"<p>Issue was due to lack of knowledge around FTP component\n<a href=\"https://camel.apache.org/components/3.18.x/ftp-component.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://camel.apache.org/components/3.18.x/ftp-component.html</a></p>\n<p>Where it is specified that absolute paths are not supported, unfortunately I did not read this page and only referenced the SFTP component page where it is not specified.\n<a href=\"https://camel.apache.org/components/3.18.x/sftp-component.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://camel.apache.org/components/3.18.x/sftp-component.html</a></p>\n<p>Issue was resolved by backtracking directories with /../../ before giving the absolute path.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":17955680,"reputation":93,"user_id":13047795,"display_name":"Zach"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":586,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":74218491,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1666856842,"creation_date":1666855678,"question_id":74218274,"body_markdown":"Currently I am unable to grab -&gt; archive -&gt; decrypt a file from an SFTP server.

The code above keeps rolling until the user enters zero. Let&#39;s modify this so that it returns a *positive integer*.\r\n```\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\tScanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Let&#39;s start rolling some dice&quot;);\r\n\twhile (true) {\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Hello!

Good coding practices call for minimizing the scope of variables. This means (in theory):\r\n\r\n 1. No global variables, period!\r\n 2. Local variables should be declared at the lowest possible block.\r\n 3. Variables shall be declared as close to the point of usage as possible.\r\n\r\nOf course, in practice, global variables are often necessary. But what no developer should do is declare global variables by default. Instead, all variables shall be declared at the lowest levels of the code, and then &quot;bubbled up&quot; as needed and stop &quot;bubbling&quot; them up when the desired accessibility is reached. Let&#39;s look at an example from this code.\r\n\r\nThe variable `numOfDice` is declared inside the *while* loop. This is the lowest level where this variable can be declared. Since the variable is used at the top of the loop, it is OK to declare it and assign a value in the same line. The question is, should this variable be declared outside the loop? The answer is yes, for a very specific reason.\r\n\r\nCreating a &quot;forever&quot; loop `while(true){...}` may not be a good idea. IN FACT, it can be argued that putting the break condition there might be a better coding practice than to include the break condition inside the loop. So, for this reason (and improving readability of the code as well), we might be better off setting the the variable outside the loop to a value, and then prompt the user to enter the number of rolls inside the loop like this:\r\n```\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Let&#39;s start rolling some dice&quot;);\r\nint numOfDice = -1;\r\nwhile (numOfDice != 0) {\r\n\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Hello! How many dice would you like to roll&quot;);\r\n\tint numOfDice = scan.nextInt();\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSetting the value to -1 allows the instruction pointer to enter the loop because the evaluation of `numOfDice` returns true. Once inside the loop, it will continue to iterate until the evaluation returns false; and this is when the user enters 0. In the original code, negative values prompt an error message. Negative and positive values continue the &quot;game&quot;. This is perfectly fine. As to the improved readability, when you see `while (numOfDice != 0)` the intent is clear; much better than to &quot;hide&quot; the break condition inside the loop. If the loop contain a lot of lines of code, the break condition is harder to find. So, in the end, this is a better solution.\r\n\r\nAn alternative is to use a *do...while* loop. This is the preferred structure when the intent is for the loop to run at least once. This is possible because the break condition is evaluated at the end of the loop rather than at the beginning in a conventional *while* loop. The equivalent *do...while* loop is as follows:\r\n```\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Let&#39;s start rolling some dice&quot;);\r\nint numOfDice = 0; // initialize to the break condition value (just in case)\r\ndo {\r\n\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Hello! How many dice would you like to roll&quot;);\r\n\tint numOfDice = scan.nextInt();\r\n    ...\r\n} while (numOfDice != 0);\r\n```\r\nThe last thing with regards to scope. I mentioned before that variables should be declared as close to the point of usage as possible. This means that instead of this\r\n```\r\npublic void myMethod() {\r\n    int myVariable = 0\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n    myVariable = someCodeThatSetsValue();\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n}\r\n```\r\nYou should do this instead to follow best practices\r\n```\r\npublic void myMethod() {\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n    int myVariable = someCodeThatSetsValue();\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","title":"How to use while loop user input established variable out of scope (if possible)","body":"<p>Let me start by showing my solution first...</p>\n<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {\n    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\n    System.out.println(&quot;Let's start rolling some dice&quot;);\n    while (true) {\n        System.out.println(&quot;Hello!

How many dice would you like to roll&quot;);\n        int numOfDice = scan.nextInt();\n        if (numOfDice &lt; 0) {\n            System.err.println(&quot;Please enter a positive integer and try again&quot;);\n        } else if (numOfDice == 0) {\n            System.out.println(&quot;Goodbye!&quot;);\n            break;\n        } else {\n            // Add some code here (i.e. a Random generation of dice values 1-6)\n            System.out.println(&quot;You rolled a &quot; + diceRollValue);\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    scan.close();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Variable Scope</h2>\n<p>Since the OP seems to struggle with issues related to scope, I will expand on this answer to focus on scope. Good coding practices call for minimizing the scope of variables. This means (in theory):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No global variables, period!</li>\n<li>Local variables should be declared at the lowest possible block.</li>\n<li>Variables shall be declared as close to the point of usage as possible.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, in practice, global variables are often necessary. But what no developer should do is declare global variables by default. Instead, all variables shall be declared at the lowest levels of the code, and then &quot;bubbled up&quot; as needed and stop &quot;bubbling&quot; them up when the desired accessibility is reached. Let's look at an example from this code.</p>\n<p>The variable <code>numOfDice</code> is declared inside the <em>while</em> loop. This is the lowest level where this variable can be declared. Since the variable is used at the top of the loop, it is OK to declare it and assign a value in the same line. The question is, should this variable be declared outside the loop? The answer is yes, for a very specific reason.</p>\n<p>Creating a &quot;forever&quot; loop <code>while(true){...}</code> may not be a good idea. IN FACT, it can be argued that putting the break condition there might be a better coding practice than to include the break condition inside the loop. So, for this reason (and improving readability of the code as well), we might be better off setting the the variable outside the loop to a value, and then prompt the user to enter the number of rolls inside the loop like this:</p>\n<pre><code>System.out.println(&quot;Let's start rolling some dice&quot;);\nint numOfDice = -1;\nwhile (numOfDice != 0) {\n    System.out.println(&quot;Hello! How many dice would you like to roll&quot;);\n    int numOfDice = scan.nextInt();\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Setting the value to -1 allows the instruction pointer to enter the loop because the evaluation of <code>numOfDice</code> returns true. Once inside the loop, it will continue to iterate until the evaluation returns false; and this is when the user enters 0. In the original code, negative values prompt an error message. Negative and positive values continue the &quot;game&quot;. This is perfectly fine. As to the improved readability, when you see <code>while (numOfDice != 0)</code> the intent is clear; much better than to &quot;hide&quot; the break condition inside the loop. If the loop contain a lot of lines of code, the break condition is harder to find. So, in the end, this is a better solution.</p>\n<p>An alternative is to use a <em>do...while</em> loop. This is the preferred structure when the intent is for the loop to run at least once. This is possible because the break condition is evaluated at the end of the loop rather than at the beginning in a conventional <em>while</em> loop. The equivalent <em>do...while</em> loop is as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>System.out.println(&quot;Let's start rolling some dice&quot;);\nint numOfDice = 0; // initialize to the break condition value (just in case)\ndo {\n    System.out.println(&quot;Hello! How many dice would you like to roll&quot;);\n    int numOfDice = scan.nextInt();\n    ...\n} while (numOfDice != 0);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The last thing with regards to scope. I mentioned before that variables should be declared as close to the point of usage as possible. This means that instead of this</p>\n<pre><code>public void myMethod() {\n    int myVariable = 0\n    .\n    .\n    .\n    .\n    .\n    myVariable = someCodeThatSetsValue();\n    .\n    .\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You should do this instead to follow best practices</p>\n<pre><code>public void myMethod() {\n    .\n    .\n    .\n    .\n    .\n    .\n    int myVariable = someCodeThatSetsValue();\n    .\n    .\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":26744889,"reputation":1,"user_id":20345087,"display_name":"Aden Krueger"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":372,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1666850443,"creation_date":1666843382,"question_id":74216695,"body_markdown":"I need to ask the user for a number of dice to roll, (at least 1) and then loop if necessary to return a positive integer.
