It sounds like you would then query your tracker to identify the comprehensive list of changed files.</p>\n<p>It's worth keeping in mind that if a user clicks &quot;Save&quot; or uses the equivalent shortcut, the file will no longer be 'dirty' and the above needs augmenting to detect and notify your tracking code of that. Whether that means you maintain a list of 'dirty' <code>IResource</code> and remove them from your tracker as they are saved is up to you. In my case, I extended the above to detect user inactivity on changed files after a configurable time, then programmatically save 'dirty' files and perform an additional activity on them.</p>\n<p>Detecting a file has been saved can be challenging.

As i wanted to use the stack size as a counter to pop all the items in the stack, i notice that the stack size does not return the number of items in the stack. Example:</p>\n<pre><code>    public String reverse(String string) {\n    StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer();\n    //Use a stack to reverse this string.As a stack is a LIFO collection, it goes by last in first out.\n   \n    Stack&lt;Character&gt; characters = new Stack&lt;&gt;();\n    char[] characterArray = string.toCharArray();\n    for(char ch : characterArray) {\n        characters.push(ch);\n    }\n    for(int i=0; i &lt; characterArray.length; i++) {\n        stringBuffer.append(characters.pop());\n    }\n    return stringBuffer.toString();\n  \n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>input &quot; helloworldz&quot; returns &quot;zdlrowolleh&quot; as expected. But when using the stack size as a counter....</p>\n<pre><code>    public String reverse(String string) {\n    StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer();\n    Stack&lt;Character&gt; characters = new Stack&lt;&gt;();\n    char[] characterArray = string.toCharArray();\n    for(char ch : characterArray) {\n        characters.push(ch);\n    }\n    for(int i=0; i &lt; characters.size(); i++) {\n        stringBuffer.append(characters.pop());\n    }\n    return stringBuffer.toString();\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>it returns &quot;zdlrow&quot;,</p>\n<p>meaning that the stack size did not return the number of items in the stack.\nAm i missing anything important? any help would be appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","postgresql","jooq"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":247217,"reputation":213455,"user_id":521799,"accept_rate":89,"display_name":"Lukas Eder"},"score":0,"creation_date":1681841975,"post_id":76044741,"comment_id":134121106,"body_markdown":"Do you *have to* use a pre-existing sequence?

It uses verbose format to define the whole graph of objects to be stored e.g. suppose you have a linkedList and you code like below, then the default serialization will discover all the objects which are linked and will serialize. In default serialization the object is constructed entirely from its stored bits, with no constructor calls.\r\n      \r\n      ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(\r\n          new FileOutputStream(&quot;/Users/Desktop/files/temp.txt&quot;));\r\n      oos.writeObject(linkedListHead); //writing head of linked list\r\n      oos.close();\r\n\r\nBut if you want restricted serialization or don&#39;t want some portion of your object to be serialized then use Externalizable. The Externalizable interface extends the Serializable interface and adds two methods, writeExternal() and readExternal(). These are automatically called while serialization or deserialization. While working with Externalizable we should remember that the default constructer should be public else the code will throw exception.
