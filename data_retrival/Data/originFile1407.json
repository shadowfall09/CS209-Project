In Vista, click the &quot;Change Settings&quot; button under the &quot;Computer name, domain, and workgroup&quot;\r\n&gt; heading.\r\n&gt;  - On the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab, click the button at the bottom labeled &quot;Environment Variables&quot;\r\n&gt;  - At the top of the screen, add a new User variable. The name should be `ANT_HOME`, and the value should be the path your zip file was\r\n&gt; extracted to. (i.e. `ANT_HOME = C:\\dev\\ant`)\r\n&gt;  - Add your java JDK Path to the user variables as well. The name should be `JAVA_HOME` and the value should be the path to the JDK\r\n&gt; software on your hard-drive. (i.e. `JAVA_HOME = C:\\Program\r\n&gt; Files\\java\\jdk1.8.0_xx`)\r\n&gt;  - If there is already a PATH variable, edit it and add to it. Otherwise, create one more variable named PATH, and add to it\r\n&gt; `;%ANT_HOME%\\bin`\r\n\r\nAfter installing Ant open the command prompt and type `ant -v` which will print the ant version which means you&#39;ve successfully configured ant in your windows machine. Some windows may require a restart after setting the enviroment variables.\r\n\r\nSource: [AntOnWindows][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://code.google.com/p/winant/\r\n  [2]: http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi\r\n  [3]: https://wiki.apache.org/ant/AntOnWindows","title":"Error installing Ant: ANT_HOME is set incorrectly","body":"<p><strong>Easy solution:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Use <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/winant/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WinAnt</a> installer for Windows.

E.g. when defining <code>precedence left COMMA;</code>, I get for the input</p>\n<pre><code>a,a,a,a,a,c b,b,b,a,a\n</code></pre>\n<p>a syntax error on column 19 (i.e. the first &quot;a&quot; after the last &quot;b&quot;).</p>\n<p>Changing the grammar or using semantic actions are no options.</p>\n<p>If anybody could give me some advice on how to solve this problem, it would be much appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","runtime-error"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":13259080,"reputation":236,"user_id":9574235,"display_name":"Abhishek Singh"},"score":0,"creation_date":1650735874,"post_id":71982168,"comment_id":127193486,"body_markdown":"Does this answer your question?

Each Ball should have its own thread, rather than one thread updating an array of Balls.Below is my attempt but I havent able to get this working.</p>\n<p>Any advice would be great.</p>\n<pre><code>/*Bounce class*/\n\nimport java.awt.Color;\nimport java.awt.Graphics;\nimport java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;\nimport javax.swing.JPanel;\n\npublic class Bounce2 extends JPanel implements Runnable {\n\n  private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;\n  /*variables*/\n  int x, y;\n  int anglex = 1, angley = 1, speed = 10;\n  int min = 40, max = 760;\n\n  public Bounce2() {\n    min = 60;\n    max = 740;\n  }\n\n  public void setGenerateRandom (int max, int min) {\n    x = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(min, max +1);\n    y = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt(min, max +1);\n    run();\n  }\n\n  public void run() {\n    if (x + anglex &lt; 0) {\n      anglex = speed;\n    } else if (x + anglex &gt; getWidth() - 50) {\n      anglex = -speed;\n    } else if (y + angley &lt; 0) {\n      angley = speed;\n    } else if (y + angley &gt; getHeight() - 50) {\n      angley = -speed;\n    }\n\n    x = x + anglex;\n    y = y + angley;\n  }\n\n  public void paint (Graphics g) {\n    super.paint(g); \n    Color c = Color.blue;\n    g.setColor(c);\n    g.fillOval(x, y, 80, 80);   \n  }\n\n  public void random() {\n    setGenerateRandom(max, min);\n  }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>/*Bounce2Test class*/\n    \nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\nimport javax.swing.JOptionPane;\n\npublic class Bounce2Test {\n  public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {\n    {\n      int num = 0;\n      String objects;\n\n      objects = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(&quot;Please enter number of balls!&quot;);\n      num = Integer.parseInt(objects);\n\n      // Number of threads\n      for (int i = 0; i &lt; num; i++) {\n        Thread object = new Thread(new Bounce2());\n        object.start();\n\n        JFrame frame = new JFrame(&quot;Bouncing Ball&quot;);\n        Bounce2 ball = new Bounce2();\n        frame.add(ball);\n        frame.setSize(800,800);\n        frame.setVisible(true);\n        frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\n        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n\n        ball.random();\n\n        while(true) {\n          ball.run();\n          ball.repaint();\n          Thread.sleep(10);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","gradle"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":22124137,"reputation":3297,"user_id":16376827,"display_name":"g00se"},"score":0,"creation_date":1650730567,"post_id":71981428,"comment_id":127192252,"body_markdown":"tools.jar is a bit legacy.

The weakness of this approach is that it prevents the use of immutable objects.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":23121,"reputation":527346,"user_id":57695,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"Peter Lawrey"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1277014774,"creation_date":1277014774,"answer_id":3078405,"question_id":3078389,"body_markdown":"A constructor is needed to initialise any non-default values and can contain side effects which are needed.  \r\n\r\nIf you have a programing style which encourages a minimal constructor for data transfer objects this would seem unneccasary, but the libraries have chosen not to assume any programming style for the constructors.\r\n\r\nYou can write a library which doesn&#39;t assume a default constructor, but you have to make assumptions about what the constructor would do and wouldn&#39;t do. i.e. I have written such libraries but was able to also mandate what a constructor was allowed to do so that not calling it directly was safe.","title":"Why do we need a default no argument constructor in Java?","body":"<p>A constructor is needed to initialise any non-default values and can contain side effects which are needed.  </p>\n\n<p>If you have a programing style which encourages a minimal constructor for data transfer objects this would seem unneccasary, but the libraries have chosen not to assume any programming style for the constructors.</p>\n\n<p>You can write a library which doesn't assume a default constructor, but you have to make assumptions about what the constructor would do and wouldn't do. i.e. I have written such libraries but was able to also mandate what a constructor was allowed to do so that not calling it directly was safe.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":219684,"reputation":37257,"user_id":476716,"accept_rate":77,"display_name":"OrangeDog"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":25,"is_accepted":false,"score":25,"last_activity_date":1553776547,"creation_date":1292854441,"answer_id":4490416,"question_id":3078389,"body_markdown":"Java only provides a default no-argument constructor **if no other constructors are defined**.

so i got a listView in my android app to display messages, everything has been going good ever since i got help on time but now i got a bug where the last message wont show.\r\n\r\nthe message part

It&#39;s basically a good alternative to what you&#39;re doing. \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nRead the comments in the code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * Original code was created and provided by @trashgod way back in 2011 and was \r\n * acquired from this StackOverflow Post:\r\n *\r\n *     https://stackoverflow.com/a/7137801/4725875\r\n *\r\n * Give the entire thread a good read.\r\n *\r\n * This is a good example of how you can carry out a &quot;Select All&quot;\r\n * on a specific JTable column. I modified this code to some extent\r\n * to utilize the standard Header cell component rather than a toggle \r\n * button. This should play pretty good in most Look &amp; Feels. I also \r\n * changed header names and added a class to apply ToolTips to the \r\n * Header cells.\r\n *\r\n * I think this is a good alternative to placing an actual CheckBox\r\n * into a Header cell. The JTable Header is meant to be descriptive\r\n * rather than actionary even though it does have sorting capabilities.\r\n * In my opinion, all Header cells should always maintain a good form\r\n * of descriptive quality with regards to the columns they represent.\r\n *\r\n * A Header cell with a CheckBox in it that states &quot;Check All&quot; doesn&#39;t\r\n * really describe what all the CheckBoxes are for within that column\r\n * &lt;b&gt;unless&lt;/b&gt; the CheckBoxes are merely used to select all the rows for\r\n * processing of some kind in which case, it would be far easier to use a \r\n * single line of code &quot;anywhere&quot; to basically do the same thing:\r\n * &lt;p&gt;\r\n *        jTable1.selectAll();\r\n * \r\n * Of course, this may not always be the case.\r\n * \r\n * This is a runnable code and has been tested using Java8. Note that when \r\n * you run this application, there will be tool tips that pop up when the \r\n * mouse pointer moves over the Header cells. The sort capability has been\r\n * disabled for the &quot;Confirm Purchase&quot; header cell. If you click on this cell \r\n * then all CheckBoxes within the column will be selected. If you click on it \r\n * again, all CheckBoxes will be un-selected. Note the tool tip for this header \r\n * cell for either state.\r\n * \r\n * Basic HTML has been used to provide color (and bold for the checkmark \r\n * character) to the Header cell text. \r\n * \r\n * I think this is better than placing a CheckBox into the Header cell but hey,\r\n * to each their own.\r\n */\r\npackage selectallheadertest;\r\n\r\nimport java.awt.*;\r\nimport java.awt.event.*;\r\nimport java.util.HashMap;\r\nimport java.util.Map;\r\nimport javax.swing.*;\r\nimport javax.swing.table.*;\r\n\r\n\r\npublic class SelectAllHeaderTest {\r\n\r\n    public static final int BOOLEAN_COL = 2;\r\n    public static final String PLAIN_ALL = &quot;Confirm Purchase&quot;;\r\n    public static final String PLAIN_NONE = &quot;✓ Confirm Purchase&quot;;\r\n    public static final String HTML_ALL = &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;font color=blue&gt;Confirm Purchase&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;;\r\n    public static final String HTML_NONE = &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;b&gt;✓&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&quot;\r\n            + &quot;&lt;font color=blue&gt;

I modified this code to some extent\n * to utilize the standard Header cell component rather than a toggle \n * button. This should play pretty good in most Look &amp; Feels. I also \n * changed header names and added a class to apply ToolTips to the \n * Header cells.\n *\n * I think this is a good alternative to placing an actual CheckBox\n * into a Header cell. The JTable Header is meant to be descriptive\n * rather than actionary even though it does have sorting capabilities.\n * In my opinion, all Header cells should always maintain a good form\n * of descriptive quality with regards to the columns they represent.\n *\n * A Header cell with a CheckBox in it that states &quot;Check All&quot; doesn't\n * really describe what all the CheckBoxes are for within that column\n * &lt;b&gt;unless&lt;/b&gt; the CheckBoxes are merely used to select all the rows for\n * processing of some kind in which case, it would be far easier to use a \n * single line of code &quot;anywhere&quot; to basically do the same thing:\n * &lt;p&gt;\n *        jTable1.selectAll();\n * \n * Of course, this may not always be the case.\n * \n * This is a runnable code and has been tested using Java8. Note that when \n * you run this application, there will be tool tips that pop up when the \n * mouse pointer moves over the Header cells. The sort capability has been\n * disabled for the &quot;Confirm Purchase&quot; header cell. If you click on this cell \n * then all CheckBoxes within the column will be selected. If you click on it \n * again, all CheckBoxes will be un-selected. Note the tool tip for this header \n * cell for either state.\n * \n * Basic HTML has been used to provide color (and bold for the checkmark \n * character) to the Header cell text. \n * \n * I think this is better than placing a CheckBox into the Header cell but hey,\n * to each their own.\n */\npackage selectallheadertest;\n\nimport java.awt.*;\nimport java.awt.event.*;\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\nimport javax.swing.*;\nimport javax.swing.table.*;\n\n\npublic class SelectAllHeaderTest {\n\n    public static final int BOOLEAN_COL = 2;\n    public static final String PLAIN_ALL = &quot;Confirm Purchase&quot;;\n    public static final String PLAIN_NONE = &quot;✓ Confirm Purchase&quot;;\n    public static final String HTML_ALL = &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;font color=blue&gt;Confirm Purchase&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;;\n    public static final String HTML_NONE = &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;&lt;b&gt;✓&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&quot;\n            + &quot;&lt;font color=blue&gt;

Important, Swing is NOT thread safe and you should never update the UI (or state it depends on) from outside the context of the Event Dispatching Thread\r\n\r\n# You have three basic options\r\n\r\n## Swing `Timer`\r\nThis provides you with a means to schedule a repeated callback on a regular interval, which is executed within the context of the Event Dispatching Thread\r\n\r\n\r\n## `SwingWorker`\r\nThis provides you with a wrapper class which can execute functionality on a background thread, but which can be used to pass information back to the Event Dispatching Thread for &quot;processing&quot;\r\n\r\n## `EventQueue.invokeLater`\r\nThis is basically provides away to execute functionality back on the Event Dispatching Thread (via a `Runnable` `interface`).  While this is useful, it&#39;s difficult to pass information from one context to another without having to build it in, which should have you looking at `SwingWorker` instead\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n# Push or poll?\r\n\r\nThe next question you need to ask is, do you want to &quot;push&quot; the updates or &quot;poll&quot; for them. This will effect which API approach you use to update the UI.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you want to poll the state, the a Swing `Timer` is a good choice.  Updates can be performed when you want them to be.

While there are ways you could control this via <code>JTable</code>, this is pretty simple.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BWAZ9.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BWAZ9.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<pre><code>import java.awt.BorderLayout;\nimport java.awt.EventQueue;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionEvent;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionListener;\nimport java.text.NumberFormat;\nimport java.time.Duration;\nimport java.time.Instant;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Random;\nimport javax.swing.JFrame;\nimport javax.swing.JPanel;\nimport javax.swing.JScrollPane;\nimport javax.swing.JTextArea;\nimport javax.swing.Timer;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        new Main();\n    }\n\n    public Main() {\n        EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                JFrame frame = new JFrame();\n                frame.add(new TestPane());\n                frame.pack();\n                frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\n                frame.setVisible(true);\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    public class TestPane extends JPanel {\n\n        private List&lt;Car&gt; cars = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(32);\n        private JTextArea ta = new JTextArea(10, 20);\n\n        private Random rnd = new Random();\n\n        private NumberFormat format = NumberFormat.getNumberInstance();\n\n        public TestPane() {\n            for (int index = 0; index &lt; 32; index++) {\n                Car car = new Car(&quot;Car &quot; + index, 40.0 + (rnd.nextDouble() * 180.0));\n                cars.add(car);\n            }\n\n            setLayout(new BorderLayout());\n            add(new JScrollPane(ta));\n\n            Timer timer = new Timer(1000, new ActionListener() {\n                @Override\n                public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n                    for (Car car : cars) {\n                        ta.append(car.getName() + &quot; @ &quot; + format.format(car.getSpeedKPH()) + &quot; ~ &quot; + format.format(car.getLocation()) + &quot;km\\n&quot;);\n                        if (!car.isRunning() &amp;&amp; rnd.nextBoolean()) {\n                            car.start();\n                            ta.append(car.getName() + &quot; got started\\n&quot;);\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            });\n            timer.start();\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    public class Car {\n        private String name;\n        private double speedKPH;\n        private Instant timeStartedAt;\n\n        public Car(String name, double kmp) {\n            this.speedKPH = kmp;\n            this.name = name;\n        }\n\n        public String getName() {\n            return name;\n        }\n\n        public double getSpeedKPH() {\n            return speedKPH;\n        }\n\n        public Instant getTimeStartedAt() {\n            return timeStartedAt;\n        }\n\n        public boolean isRunning() {\n            return timeStartedAt != null;\n        }\n\n        public void start() {\n            timeStartedAt = Instant.now();\n        }\n\n        protected double distanceTravelledByMillis(long millis) {\n            double time = millis / 1000d / 60d / 60d;\n            return getSpeedKPH() * time;\n        }\n\n        public double getLocation() {\n            Instant timeStartedAt = getTimeStartedAt();\n            if (timeStartedAt == null) {\n                return 0;\n            }\n            Duration time = Duration.between(timeStartedAt, Instant.now());\n            return distanceTravelledByMillis(time.toMillis());            \n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You also control the speed of the updates, which would allow you to scale the solution to a much larger number of cars (tens of thousands) before you might see a issue (although <code>JTextArea</code> would be the bottle neck before then)</p>\n<h1>Push (<code>EventQueue.invokeLater</code>)</h1>\n<p>This is a more random example, each car is given its own update interval, which triggers a callback via an observer.
