The *full* error, is a collapsed wall of text. However, I can reduce it a little bit, since this error is kind of recursive:\r\n\r\nIt starts out by saying:\r\n\r\n```\r\nA problem occurred configuring root project &#39;app&#39;.\r\n&gt; Could not resolve all files for configuration &#39;:classpath&#39;.\r\n   &gt; Could not resolve com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.4.1.\r\n     Required by:\r\n         project : &gt; com.android.application:com.android.application.gradle.plugin:7.4.1\r\n         project : &gt; com.android.library:com.android.library.gradle.plugin:7.4.1\r\n```\r\nAfter that it lists a couple of things that used gradle v.7.4.1 in a particular capacity, but then the original problem occurred.\r\n\r\nIt seems like it&#39;s trying to use 7.4.1, but keeps finding 7.5, but I don&#39;t understand the rest. Then a repetitive error was logged, and centralized around some key elements (or &#39;variants&#39;, as they were), those elements being:\r\n\r\n 1. &#39;apiElements&#39;\r\n 2. &#39;javadocElements&#39;\r\n 3. &#39;runtimeElements&#39;, and\r\n 4. &#39;sourcesElements&#39;\r\n\r\nFor each one it said something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- Variant &lt;insert variant here&gt; capability com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.4.1 declares\r\n            a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, for each one, it listed the...&quot;reasons&quot;, why the &quot;but:&quot; had to be there, with the following being the parent reason:\r\n\r\n```- Incompatible because this component declares an API of a\r\n component compatible with Java 11 and the consumer needed a runtime of a component\r\n compatible with Java 8\r\n```\r\nwhich makes no sense to me, since I *should* be using Java...**19**, but maybe 19 is only the build version and not the advertised version (?) anyway...\r\n\r\nThe &quot;other compatible attribute:&quot; sub-reasons contained some of the following, which I will use the list numbers to simplify:\r\n\r\nAll variants had this one:\r\n\r\n    - Doesn&#39;t say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required &#39;7.5&#39;)\r\n\r\nand variants 2 and 4 had both of these:\r\n\r\n    - Doesn&#39;t say anything about its target Java version (required compatibility with Java 8)\r\n\r\n    - Doesn&#39;t say anything about its elements (required them packaged as a jar)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, I want to let you know that, yes, I did muck about with the settings *at first*, but when I found I wasn&#39;t making it any better, I uninstalled the entire IDE, including my user settings, and did a fresh download and installation of the newest version of the IDE. I checked the .android folder to find the .lib folder was gone, so *maybe* it worked (???), but I&#39;m not sure, since it opened up an old project. I didn&#39;t remove any of the stuff that it wanted to see.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d like to use this [image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pgVvS.png) from another post here, which I also messed with in attempt to force it to use 7.5 by changing 7.4.1 to 7.5 and setting them to &quot;true&quot;. It didn&#39;t work, so I put it back. Hopefully this was enough information to satisfy the original conditions:\r\n\r\n1. I gave you what it was supposed to do (just compile: I&#39;m not asking for much)\r\n2. I gave you the error (gradle broke all the way)\r\n3. I gave the shortest code (which there wasn&#39;t any...cuz it&#39;s a gradle issue)\r\n\r\nMaybe it needs to move to a different sub-SO: I don&#39;t know, but I did my best here. Also if all above was completely abhorrent, I left most of the original error, untouched, down below. However, like I said, there is a more *compressed* version of this that goes even further but...I don&#39;t think you want 150+ lines of error to look at.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nHowever, I *can* give you the top-level error:\r\n\r\n```org.gradle.api.ProjectConfigurationException: A problem occurred configuring root project &#39;app&#39;```\r\n\r\n...which just says the same thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n          - Variant &#39;apiElements&#39; capability com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.4.1 declares\r\n            a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:\r\n              - Incompatible because this component declares an API of a component compatible with Java 11 and the consumer needed a runtime of a component compatible with Java 8\r\n              - Other compatible attribute:\r\n                  - Doesn&#39;t say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required &#39;7.5&#39;)\r\n          - Variant &#39;javadocElements&#39; capability com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.4.1 declares a runtime of a component, and its dependencies declared externally:\r\n              - Incompatible because this component declares documentation and the consumer needed a library\r\n              - Other compatible attributes:\r\n                  - Doesn&#39;t say anything about its target Java version (required compatibility with Java 8)\r\n                  - Doesn&#39;t say anything about its elements (required them packaged as a jar)\r\n                  - Doesn&#39;t say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required &#39;7.5&#39;)\r\n          - Variant &#39;runtimeElements&#39; capability com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.4.1 declares a runtime of a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:\r\n              - Incompatible because this component declares a component compatible with Java 11 and the consumer needed a component compatible with Java 8\r\n              - Other compatible attribute:\r\n                  - Doesn&#39;t say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required &#39;7.5&#39;)\r\n          - Variant &#39;sourcesElements&#39; capability com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.4.1 declares a runtime of a component, and its dependencies declared externally:\r\n              - Incompatible because this component declares documentation and the consumer needed a library\r\n              - Other compatible attributes:\r\n                  - Doesn&#39;t say anything about its target Java version (required compatibility with Java 8)\r\n                  - Doesn&#39;t say anything about its elements (required them packaged as a jar)\r\n                  - Doesn&#39;t say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required &#39;7.5&#39;)\r\n```","title":"Could Not Resolve com.android.tools.build:gradle No Matching Variant","body":"<p>My main goal was to create a new app, with just an Empty Activity: no bells nor whistles.

However, I can reduce it a little bit, since this error is kind of recursive:</p>\n<p>It starts out by saying:</p>\n<pre><code>A problem occurred configuring root project 'app'.\n&gt; Could not resolve all files for configuration ':classpath'.\n   &gt; Could not resolve com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.4.1.\n     Required by:\n         project : &gt; com.android.application:com.android.application.gradle.plugin:7.4.1\n         project : &gt; com.android.library:com.android.library.gradle.plugin:7.4.1\n</code></pre>\n<p>After that it lists a couple of things that used gradle v.7.4.1 in a particular capacity, but then the original problem occurred.</p>\n<p>It seems like it's trying to use 7.4.1, but keeps finding 7.5, but I don't understand the rest. Then a repetitive error was logged, and centralized around some key elements (or 'variants', as they were), those elements being:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>'apiElements'</li>\n<li>'javadocElements'</li>\n<li>'runtimeElements', and</li>\n<li>'sourcesElements'</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For each one it said something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>- Variant &lt;insert variant here&gt; capability com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.4.1 declares\n            a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, for each one, it listed the...&quot;reasons&quot;, why the &quot;but:&quot; had to be there, with the following being the parent reason:</p>\n<pre><code> component compatible with Java 11 and the consumer needed a runtime of a component\n compatible with Java 8\n</code></pre>\n<p>which makes no sense to me, since I <em>should</em> be using Java...<strong>19</strong>, but maybe 19 is only the build version and not the advertised version (?) anyway...</p>\n<p>The &quot;other compatible attribute:&quot; sub-reasons contained some of the following, which I will use the list numbers to simplify:</p>\n<p>All variants had this one:</p>\n<pre><code>- Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '7.5')\n</code></pre>\n<p>and variants 2 and 4 had both of these:</p>\n<pre><code>- Doesn't say anything about its target Java version (required compatibility with Java 8)\n\n- Doesn't say anything about its elements (required them packaged as a jar)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, I want to let you know that, yes, I did muck about with the settings <em>at first</em>, but when I found I wasn't making it any better, I uninstalled the entire IDE, including my user settings, and did a fresh download and installation of the newest version of the IDE. I checked the .android folder to find the .lib folder was gone, so <em>maybe</em> it worked (???), but I'm not sure, since it opened up an old project. I didn't remove any of the stuff that it wanted to see.</p>\n<p>I'd like to use this <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pgVvS.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">image</a> from another post here, which I also messed with in attempt to force it to use 7.5 by changing 7.4.1 to 7.5 and setting them to &quot;true&quot;. It didn't work, so I put it back. Hopefully this was enough information to satisfy the original conditions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I gave you what it was supposed to do (just compile: I'm not asking for much)</li>\n<li>I gave you the error (gradle broke all the way)</li>\n<li>I gave the shortest code (which there wasn't any...cuz it's a gradle issue)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Maybe it needs to move to a different sub-SO: I don't know, but I did my best here. Also if all above was completely abhorrent, I left most of the original error, untouched, down below. However, like I said, there is a more <em>compressed</em> version of this that goes even further but...I don't think you want 150+ lines of error to look at.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>However, I <em>can</em> give you the top-level error:</p>\n<p><code>org.gradle.api.ProjectConfigurationException: A problem occurred configuring root project 'app'</code></p>\n<p>...which just says the same thing.</p>\n<pre><code>          - Variant 'apiElements' capability com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.4.1 declares\n            a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:\n              - Incompatible because this component declares an API of a component compatible with Java 11 and the consumer needed a runtime of a component compatible with Java 8\n              - Other compatible attribute:\n                  - Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '7.5')\n          - Variant 'javadocElements' capability com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.4.1 declares a runtime of a component, and its dependencies declared externally:\n              - Incompatible because this component declares documentation and the consumer needed a library\n              - Other compatible attributes:\n                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java version (required compatibility with Java 8)\n                  - Doesn't say anything about its elements (required them packaged as a jar)\n                  - Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '7.5')\n          - Variant 'runtimeElements' capability com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.4.1 declares a runtime of a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:\n              - Incompatible because this component declares a component compatible with Java 11 and the consumer needed a component compatible with Java 8\n              - Other compatible attribute:\n                  - Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '7.5')\n          - Variant 'sourcesElements' capability com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.4.1 declares a runtime of a component, and its dependencies declared externally:\n              - Incompatible because this component declares documentation and the consumer needed a library\n              - Other compatible attributes:\n                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java version (required compatibility with Java 8)\n                  - Doesn't say anything about its elements (required them packaged as a jar)\n                  - Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '7.5')\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","serialization","java-threads"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2165697,"reputation":331,"user_id":1918853,"display_name":"Robert Rohm"},"score":0,"creation_date":1682503456,"post_id":76109402,"comment_id":134233111,"body_markdown":"If you get an error: Please provide a stack trace.

Volatile variables.\r\n 2. Interrupt system.\r\n 3. Synchronized (methods or blocks).\r\n 4. wait() + notify() system.\r\n\r\nFor completeness there is also the [`Thread.stop()`][1] and [`Thread.suspend()`][2] methods - but per the documentation they are inherently unsafe and should not be used. Now deprecated for eventual removal. See [*Why are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?*][3].\r\n\r\nAdditionally you should review the [`java.util.concurrent`][4] package - however my understanding is that the concurrent package is built on top of the 4 primitives listed above, as a result it does not provide any additional capabilities (that you couldn&#39;t implement yourself using those primitives).\r\n\r\nThe first two primitives listed above can be viewed as mechanisms to pause/abort running Threads. The last two are more related to synchronization/correctness and performance optimization (not having idle threads burning CPU).\r\n\r\nThe simplest case for a volatile variable would be a boolean flag `shouldTerminate` it is initialized with a value false. Then your main processing loop in the worker thread would typically have something like:\r\n\r\n    while(!shouldTerminate) {\r\n      // Do something.\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHence if you want to signal a worker thread to terminated you can simply set `shouldTerminate = true;` and the worker thread will break out of its loop. How many flags you have and which worker Threads use which flags determines the level of control you have over when the workers will be terminated.\r\n\r\nThe core issue with (only) using volatile variables is that Threads can get blocked in several ways:\r\n* Waiting on a monitor (synchronized block) - possibly during a wait()\r\n* Executing a Thread.sleep()\r\n* Performing IO.\r\n\r\nIf you only use volatile variables the Thread won&#39;t abort until whatever situation is blocking its execution is cleared - once the block is cleared the Thread will then be able to check the variable and if required shut down.\r\n\r\nThis is where notify() and interrupt() come in:\r\n* notify() allows you to instruct another thread to break out of a wait().\r\n* interrupt() will typically break the other thread out of a sleep() and/or if it is blocked on IO.\r\n\r\nNote: `notify()` wakes a (single) **random** thread hence if you have multiple Threads waiting on a single monitor it is generally good practice to use `notifyAll()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Is there an efficient way to stop the async process?\r\n\r\nYou can `cancel()` on the [`Future`][5] you get back when scheduling jobs - but if the job is already running this is implemented as an `interrupt()`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can define a variable to signal to the job it should terminate - this is typically a cleaner solution - but it has the drawbacks outlined above.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit - Atomic Classes**\r\n\r\nAs @Basil Bourque - points out in the comments the `Atomic...` classes are a grey area. I don&#39;t consider them primitives themselves, but they do leverage a primitive that I did not mention in my list above (the CAS operations from the `VarHandle` class).\r\n\r\nThe above list of primitives are typically something you might choose to use directly, where as I would recommend using the `Atomic...` classes in preference to directly invoking CAS operations.\r\n\r\nTBF - since `java.util.concurrent` was added I haven&#39;t worked with `interrupt()` or wait/notify much. I have usually found one of the concurrent classes meets my needs, but I do still use volatile booleans to terminate execution of background threads - this is because I don&#39;t know how well third party libraries (typically used in worker threads) would cope with an interrupt. So I would rather accept that there will be a delay, while any IO completes before termination can occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Thread.html#stop()\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Thread.html#suspend()\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/threadPrimitiveDeprecation.html\r\n  [4]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html\r\n  [5]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Future.html","title":"how to stop a running thread(async process) in Java","body":"<p>In Java there are basically 4 primitives to support inter-thread communication:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Volatile variables.</li>\n<li>Interrupt system.</li>\n<li>Synchronized (methods or blocks).</li>\n<li>wait() + notify() system.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For completeness there is also the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Thread.html#stop()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Thread.stop()</code></a> and <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Thread.html#suspend()\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Thread.suspend()</code></a> methods - but per the documentation they are inherently unsafe and should not be used.

How many flags you have and which worker Threads use which flags determines the level of control you have over when the workers will be terminated.</p>\n<p>The core issue with (only) using volatile variables is that Threads can get blocked in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Waiting on a monitor (synchronized block) - possibly during a wait()</li>\n<li>Executing a Thread.sleep()</li>\n<li>Performing IO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you only use volatile variables the Thread won't abort until whatever situation is blocking its execution is cleared - once the block is cleared the Thread will then be able to check the variable and if required shut down.</p>\n<p>This is where notify() and interrupt() come in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>notify() allows you to instruct another thread to break out of a wait().</li>\n<li>interrupt() will typically break the other thread out of a sleep() and/or if it is blocked on IO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: <code>notify()</code> wakes a (single) <strong>random</strong> thread hence if you have multiple Threads waiting on a single monitor it is generally good practice to use <code>notifyAll()</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is there an efficient way to stop the async process?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can <code>cancel()</code> on the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Future.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Future</code></a> you get back when scheduling jobs - but if the job is already running this is implemented as an <code>interrupt()</code>.</p>\n<p>Alternatively you can define a variable to signal to the job it should terminate - this is typically a cleaner solution - but it has the drawbacks outlined above.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit - Atomic Classes</strong></p>\n<p>As @Basil Bourque - points out in the comments the <code>Atomic...</code> classes are a grey area. I don't consider them primitives themselves, but they do leverage a primitive that I did not mention in my list above (the CAS operations from the <code>VarHandle</code> class).</p>\n<p>The above list of primitives are typically something you might choose to use directly, where as I would recommend using the <code>Atomic...</code> classes in preference to directly invoking CAS operations.</p>\n<p>TBF - since <code>java.util.concurrent</code> was added I haven't worked with <code>interrupt()</code> or wait/notify much. I have usually found one of the concurrent classes meets my needs, but I do still use volatile booleans to terminate execution of background threads - this is because I don't know how well third party libraries (typically used in worker threads) would cope with an interrupt. So I would rather accept that there will be a delay, while any IO completes before termination can occur.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":11892387,"reputation":334,"user_id":8702806,"display_name":"Uta Alexandru"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1682452631,"creation_date":1682452631,"answer_id":76104957,"question_id":76099716,"body_markdown":"I would personally save the start date of the tasks into a global variable , and create another scheduler which checks at specified interval (depending on your needs) , if the now- start date stored earlier is higher than 1 hour . \r\n If it is, i would call myExecutorService.shutdownNow() method .","title":"how to stop a running thread(async process) in Java","body":"<p>I would personally save the start date of the tasks into a global variable , and create another scheduler which checks at specified interval (depending on your needs) , if the now- start date stored earlier is higher than 1 hour .\nIf it is, i would call myExecutorService.shutdownNow() method .</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":28407847,"reputation":9,"user_id":21731606,"display_name":"Sunil Reddy"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":172,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1682467338,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1682482708,"creation_date":1682415638,"question_id":76099716,"body_markdown":"I have a Job class which triggers 3 different runnable tasks inside an executor service.
