The `int enums` he&#39;s writing about are not &#39;real enums&#39; like Java `enum`s, but only int values that are defined in / matched with int constants.\r\n - In Java, enums are class-like things. In almost all aspects, you can implement a Java enum just like a class, with minor restrictions (private constructor, no inheritance)\r\n - You can also use Java&#39;s enum variables like you would use Object variables, with the same operators etc\r\n - The classical &#39;int enums&#39; that other languages use will usually not be treated like classes/objects, but - in Java terms - primitives. So this gives the whole &#39;enum&#39; handling a very different aspect from Java\r\n\r\n2. The problem that he describes (*&quot;If the value associated with an int enum is changed, its clients must be recompiled. If not, the clients will still run, but their behavior will be incorrect.&quot;*) still holds true for some situations concerning Java enums. \r\n - If you try to store those, you usually(wrongfully) reduce their storage value to an int, the `ordinal()` value. However, if you change the order of enums by adding/removing/reordering enum constants inside the enum class, their respective `ordinal()` value will also change. If you then restore an enum from data, you load the old ordinal value but will get the wrong enum constant. So you should always have an individual enum ID in your Java enums, or save and restore by the enum constants&#39; names. *This is just a Java analogy to what can happen with other languages when updating libraries.*\r\n - In Java you can also run into problems with enums and updating libraries.

But I was wondering why the multithreading course got deleted despite only deleting the student that was associated to it. From a database perspective, I was under the impression that it would only delete the targeted entity/record and not anything it&#39;s related to (in this case; the multithreading course). Am I right with this assumption? Is it normal from a database perspective to delete records that are related to the record you are deleting?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I am seeing this effect because in the `Student` class, I am using `cascade = CascadeType.ALL`. If I delete this then I get the following error:\r\n\r\n    org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException: org.hibernate.TransientObjectException: object references an unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing: com.example.university.domain.Course; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalStateException: org.hibernate.TransientObjectException: object references an unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing: com.example.university.domain.Course\r\n\r\nThis occurs when the code is trying to save the `s1` student object. Am I right in assuming that I should: save the multithreading course, then fetch the multithreading course and then add it to `s1`&#39;s course list? But my confusion is when should I use cascading ALL and when should I not use it.","title":"How to prevent cascading deletion","body":"<p>So I'm experimenting with Spring Data more specifically relationships (many to many).</p>\n<p>This is what I have at the moment:</p>\n<p>COURSE:</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity\n@Table(name = &quot;COURSE&quot;)\npublic class Course {\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n    private Integer courseId;\n\n    @Column\n    private String name;\n\n    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = &quot;courses&quot;, fetch = FetchType.EAGER)\n    List&lt;Student&gt;

But I was wondering why the multithreading course got deleted despite only deleting the student that was associated to it. From a database perspective, I was under the impression that it would only delete the targeted entity/record and not anything it's related to (in this case; the multithreading course). Am I right with this assumption? Is it normal from a database perspective to delete records that are related to the record you are deleting?</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I am seeing this effect because in the <code>Student</code> class, I am using <code>cascade = CascadeType.ALL</code>. If I delete this then I get the following error:</p>\n<pre><code>org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException: org.hibernate.TransientObjectException: object references an unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing: com.example.university.domain.Course; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalStateException: org.hibernate.TransientObjectException: object references an unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing: com.example.university.domain.Course\n</code></pre>\n<p>This occurs when the code is trying to save the <code>s1</code> student object. Am I right in assuming that I should: save the multithreading course, then fetch the multithreading course and then add it to <code>s1</code>'s course list? But my confusion is when should I use cascading ALL and when should I not use it.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","security","jpa","enums"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":17849762,"reputation":104,"user_id":12965752,"display_name":"Bhushan"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1639398186,"creation_date":1639398186,"answer_id":70334607,"question_id":70334360,"body_markdown":"**You can define like this**\r\n\r\n    public enum UserRoleEnum {\r\n\t  USER, ADMIN\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**And in entity**\r\n\r\n    @Enumerated(EnumType.ORDINAL)\r\n    private UserRoleEnum role;","title":"Java JPA enum-like String options","body":"<p><strong>You can define like this</strong></p>\n<pre><code>public enum UserRoleEnum {\n  USER, ADMIN\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>And in entity</strong></p>\n<pre><code>@Enumerated(EnumType.ORDINAL)\nprivate UserRoleEnum role;\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":4368701,"reputation":397,"user_id":3563655,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"Rick"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":276,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":70334607,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1639398186,"creation_date":1639397046,"question_id":70334360,"body_markdown":"I am trying to implement a simple User-Roles relationship in a Spring application, for security.

Running just test class A. Execution stopped in the break point only once.\r\n 2. Running test class A with some other test class (for example, B). Execution stopped only once for B, but twice for A. The second time it failed with the aforementioned error.\r\n 3.

OSes is string oriented. In other words, the information that Java will receive to call <code>main</code>, will already be in string form (and only string), so using <code>Object[]</code> for <code>main</code> would require programmers to add explicit casts to <code>String</code> each time they would want to use an argument as a string.

But problem is, only last 128 characters should be in this object. I can't use StringBuffer, because operation should be non-blocking.</p>\n<p>So,there are two operations:</p>\n<p>First: check if StringBuilder already has 128 chars.</p>\n<p>Second: if it has not -&gt; add new char, if it has -&gt; delete first char and add new char.</p>\n<p>Is there a way to make this two or three operations atomic?</p>\n<p>I made this method, but it doesn't work:</p>\n<pre><code>public void append(String string) {\n        this.sbRef.getAndUpdate(ref -&gt; {\n            if (ref.length() &lt; 128) {\n                ref.append(string);\n            } else {\n                ref.append(string).delete(0, ref.length() - 128);\n            }\n            return ref;\n        });\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>For testing I created this method:</p>\n<pre><code>public void test() {\nAtomicStringBuilder atomicStringBuilder = new AtomicStringBuilder();\nRandom random = new Random();\nStream&lt;Integer&gt; infiniteStream = Stream.iterate(0, i -&gt; random.nextInt(10));\n\ninfiniteStream.parallel()\n.limit(100000)\n.forEach(integer -&gt; atomicStringBuilder.append(String.valueOf(integer)));\n\nassertEquals(128, atomicStringBuilder.getSb().get().length());\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is not a real prolem, I can change AtomicReference with anything else which will work.
