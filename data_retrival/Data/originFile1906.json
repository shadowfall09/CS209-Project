If you only keep one of those channels you&#39;ll skew the results.\r\n\r\nInstead you need to decide whether a pixel should retain its original color or become grayscale. So assuming your code already does the conversion to grayscale correctly, it comes down to this:\r\n\r\n    if( keepColor ) {\r\n      //I&#39;ll keep the order of the components that your example uses, make sure this is correct\r\n      bos.write(b);\r\n      bos.write(g);\r\n      bos.write(r);\r\n    } else {\r\n       bos.write(gri); //b\r\n       bos.write(gri); //g\r\n       bos.write(gri); //r\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo what is left is how `keepColor` is defined and that depends on your requirements.

I added the type `Node` for the first and replaced the latter two by `Doc`. FYI: using initial caps for names of locals (also fields or methods) is against conventional style and thus feels weird, but does work, so I didn&#39;t bother changing these.\r\n\r\n* `SignatureMethod.RSA_SHA1` is not a valid `Transform` and trying to use it as one throws an exception. It also doesn&#39;t make sense to be in the Transforms list of a Reference, because signature is not applied separately to one Reference, but to the SignedInfo which includes potentially multiple References plus other data. I removed it.\r\n\r\n* in addition for more convenient testing I replaced the file I/O (which looked okay) with canned input and console output.\r\n\r\nWith these changes I do reproduce the stackoverflow. This is because you specified #1 as the URI and 1 as the id of the Reference, so to resolve the Reference it must goto the referenced element and resolve it, and the referenced element is itself the (same) Reference so it must go to the identified referenced element and resolve it, so it must etc etc. You must not make the id of the Reference the same as the element you are trying to reference, should not make it the same any other element, and you don&#39;t need to refer to the Reference itself so it&#39;s better to not set _any_ id for it. I changed the id in `newReference` to null.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, it does work for me to sign &quot;&quot; (the whole document) but not &quot;#1&quot;. I found _that_ is because #x does NOT refer to (an element with) an attribute _named_ &quot;id&quot;, it refers to (one with) an attribute _defined in the schema or DTD_ as an id -- and your `&lt;InfRps id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;` is not defined as an id.

Rather than fiddle with editting _and_ using a schema, I wrote a (very!) minimal DTD to make this attribute an id, and the following code works for me to sign the desired element (using a dummy key&amp;cert I created):\r\n```\r\n\tstatic void SO69652045XMLSign (String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n\t\t//++ debug data\r\n\t\tString input = &quot;&lt;!DOCTYPE RecepcionarLoteRps [ &lt;!ATTLIST InfRps id ID #REQUIRED&gt;

I added the type <code>Node</code> for the first and replaced the latter two by <code>Doc</code>. FYI: using initial caps for names of locals (also fields or methods) is against conventional style and thus feels weird, but does work, so I didn't bother changing these.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>SignatureMethod.RSA_SHA1</code> is not a valid <code>Transform</code> and trying to use it as one throws an exception. It also doesn't make sense to be in the Transforms list of a Reference, because signature is not applied separately to one Reference, but to the SignedInfo which includes potentially multiple References plus other data. I removed it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>in addition for more convenient testing I replaced the file I/O (which looked okay) with canned input and console output.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these changes I do reproduce the stackoverflow. This is because you specified #1 as the URI and 1 as the id of the Reference, so to resolve the Reference it must goto the referenced element and resolve it, and the referenced element is itself the (same) Reference so it must go to the identified referenced element and resolve it, so it must etc etc. You must not make the id of the Reference the same as the element you are trying to reference, should not make it the same any other element, and you don't need to refer to the Reference itself so it's better to not set <em>any</em> id for it. I changed the id in <code>newReference</code> to null.</p>\n<p>With these changes, it does work for me to sign &quot;&quot; (the whole document) but not &quot;#1&quot;. I found <em>that</em> is because #x does NOT refer to (an element with) an attribute <em>named</em> &quot;id&quot;, it refers to (one with) an attribute <em>defined in the schema or DTD</em> as an id -- and your <code>&lt;InfRps id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</code> is not defined as an id. See<br />\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56770641/no-working-id-attribute-when-parsing-xml-in-java\">No working ID attribute when parsing XML in java</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3423430/java-xml-dom-how-are-id-attributes-special\">Java XML DOM: how are id Attributes special?</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19929107/xml-id-attribute-to-work-with-javas-getelementbyid\">Xml id attribute to work with Java&#39;s getElementById?</a></p>\n<p>The schema you reference defines this attribute only as a string not an id, and isn't being used anyway because DOM-parser by default doesn't use schemas. Rather than fiddle with editting <em>and</em> using a schema, I wrote a (very!) minimal DTD to make this attribute an id, and the following code works for me to sign the desired element (using a dummy key&amp;cert I created):</p>\n<pre><code>    static void SO69652045XMLSign (String[] args) throws Exception {\n        //++ debug data\n        String input = &quot;&lt;!DOCTYPE RecepcionarLoteRps [ &lt;!ATTLIST InfRps id ID #REQUIRED&gt;
