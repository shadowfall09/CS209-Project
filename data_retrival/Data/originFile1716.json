How do I create the configuration files in intelliJ and link those with Kafka?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android-studio","android-alertdialog","email-validation","reset-password"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":16083136,"reputation":1360,"user_id":12056368,"display_name":"Apps Maven"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1641191547,"creation_date":1641191547,"answer_id":70562348,"question_id":70513649,"body_markdown":"Use this code:\r\n\r\n    forgotPText.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public void onClick(View v) {\r\n                    //start alert dialog\r\n                    LayoutInflater inflater = getLayoutInflater();\r\n                    AlertDialog.Builder reset_alert = new AlertDialog.Builder(MainActivity.this);\r\n                    View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.reset_popup,null);\r\n                    reset_alert.setView(view);\r\n    \r\n                    EditText email = view.findViewById(R.id.email);\r\n                    TextView tv_cancel = view.findViewById(R.id.tv_cancel);\r\n                    TextView tv_submit = view.findViewById(R.id.tv_submit);\r\n    \r\n                    tv_cancel.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\r\n                        @Override\r\n                        public void onClick(View view) {\r\n                            InputMethodManager inputManager = (InputMethodManager) getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);\r\n                            inputManager.hideSoftInputFromWindow(view.getWindowToken(), InputMethodManager.HIDE_NOT_ALWAYS);\r\n    \r\n                            new Handler().postDelayed(new Runnable() {\r\n                                @Override\r\n                                public void run() { alertDialog.dismiss();

The NetBeans IDE does this automatically when you create your Java Application project using the New Project wizard and the **Create Main Class** option is check marked;\r\n 5. Apply the `jl1.0.1.jar` library to your Project within your Java\r\n    IDE. Use whatever method required by your particular IDE to do this;\r\n 6. Copy/Paste the following Imports to your new PlayMP3 class:\r\n    ```    \r\n    import java.io.FileInputStream;\r\n    import java.io.IOException;\r\n    import javazoom.jl.decoder.JavaLayerException;\r\n    import javazoom.jl.player.Player;\r\n    ```\r\n 7.

If this <code>command</code> corresponds to, e.g., &quot;send&quot;, I need to send a message to every Client connected to the Server.</p>\n<p>How am I able to do this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","swing","jtable","tablerowsorter"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":194308,"reputation":66720,"user_id":436560,"accept_rate":87,"display_name":"Lajos Arpad"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1641180889,"creation_date":1639662637,"answer_id":70380152,"question_id":70379897,"body_markdown":"Your problem is that your sorting is doing an alphabetical sort, which works well for `String` objects, but once you have `Integers` to sort, you will have the situation that 2 &gt; 19, because alphabetically 2 is after 1.\r\n\r\nYou will need something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDefaultTableModel model = new DefaultTableModel(data,columns) {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public Class getColumnClass(int column) {\r\n        switch (column) {\r\n            case 4: {\r\n                //assuming that the int column you have is in the fourth column\r\n                return Integer.class; \r\n            } break;\r\n            default:\r\n                return String.class;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `data` is an `Object[][]` and `columns` is an `Object[]`.\r\n","title":"JTable RowSorter order wrong","body":"<p>Your problem is that your sorting is doing an alphabetical sort, which works well for <code>String</code> objects, but once you have <code>Integers</code> to sort, you will have the situation that 2 &gt; 19, because alphabetically 2 is after 1.</p>\n<p>You will need something like:</p>\n<pre><code>DefaultTableModel model = new DefaultTableModel(data,columns) {\n    @Override\n    public Class getColumnClass(int column) {\n        switch (column) {\n            case 4: {\n                //assuming that the int column you have is in the fourth column\n                return Integer.class; \n            } break;\n            default:\n                return String.class;\n        }\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>data</code> is an <code>Object[][]</code> and <code>columns</code> is an <code>Object[]</code>.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":23665806,"reputation":13,"user_id":17693278,"display_name":"Mackey"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":80,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":70380152,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1641180889,"creation_date":1639661553,"question_id":70379897,"body_markdown":"I imported javax.swing.table.TableRowSorter;\r\n\r\nused it in the table model.

So, one more security rule may be necessary:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;intercept-url pattern=\"/about.*\" .../&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","android-studio"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":5968065,"reputation":14213,"user_id":4691279,"accept_rate":58,"display_name":"hagrawal7777"},"score":1,"creation_date":1448465647,"post_id":33920343,"comment_id":55601954,"body_markdown":"Check this - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20270190/how-to-choose-language-level-for-new-project-in-android-studio","body":"Check this - <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20270190/how-to-choose-language-level-for-new-project-in-android-studio\" title=\"how to choose language level for new project in android studio\">stackoverflow.com/questions/20270190/&hellip;</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":7295196,"reputation":1285,"user_id":5560309,"accept_rate":43,"display_name":"Hadas Kaminsky"},"score":1,"creation_date":1448471498,"post_id":33920343,"comment_id":55605977,"body_markdown":"Thanks, saw this question but this is a dialog for a new project and I&#39;m already working on an existing one","body":"Thanks, saw this question but this is a dialog for a new project and I&#39;m already working on an existing one"},{"owner":{"account_id":5968065,"reputation":14213,"user_id":4691279,"accept_rate":58,"display_name":"hagrawal7777"},"score":0,"creation_date":1448471793,"post_id":33920343,"comment_id":55606164,"body_markdown":"But you must have gone through that and there must be some provision of doing it again for existing one ..

It then continues from turn number 11 and \"solves the tour\".</p>\n\n<p>Also I'm unsure how to continue if a pattern don't solve the problem.

The first, which has been pointed out already, is that you miss out the check (A).  The second, more serious, problem is that this algorithm does not work.  In fact, you end up with the following: \r\n\r\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/nMmng.png&quot; height=&quot;250&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nIn this picture, the black knights represent the start and end squares, while the white knights are all the other squares covered.  If you follow your algorithm, you eventually end up in a square where you can&#39;t get to any other squares that haven&#39;t been covered already.  That doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t do a knight&#39;s tour on a chessboard, just that your algorithm doesn&#39;t work.  \r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf that really is the algorithm you want to implement, then there is no reason to use recursion, as a `for` loop will work just as well.  Your function `recursive` returns true when there exists a valid knight&#39;s move from the square we are currently on.  There are two reasons that this is not actually a recursive algorithm: \r\n\r\n1. The `recursive` function is not idempotent - it has a side effect, which is to fill in a square of the `positionsVisited` array.  \r\n2. The `recursive` function calls on a global variable - `positionsVisited` (I say &#39;global variable&#39;, rather than &#39;private field&#39;, because what you have written is essentially procedural code).  \r\n\r\nInstead, the function `recursive` should tell you a much more general piece of information: given a particular square on the chess board, and a particular set of squares which we are not allowed to visit, is there a knight&#39;s tour of the remaining squares?  (Of course, calling that function with the square a1 and an empty array of visited positions will tell you whether there is a knight&#39;s tour at all.)  The function can also return a string which will tell you what the knight&#39;s tour is.  \r\n\r\nThe structure of the recursive function should then be something like the following: \r\n\r\n    private boolean isKnightsTour(Square currentSquare,\r\n                                  int[9][9] visitedSquares,\r\n                                  KnightsTour tour)\r\n    {\r\n      // Append the current square to the array of visited squares.\r\n      int[9][9] newVisitedSquares = visitedSquares;\r\n      newVisitedSquares[currentSquare.getX()][currentSquare.getY()] = 1;\r\n      \r\n      // If we have visited all the squares, there is a knight&#39;s tour.  \r\n      // Add some code here to check for that.\r\n      if (allSquaresVisited()) {\r\n        tour = new KnightsTour(currentSquare);\r\n        return true;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      // Test all squares a knight&#39;s move away.  If you get a knight&#39;s tour, \r\n      // append the current square to the start and return that.  \r\n      KnightsTour newTour;\r\n      if (isKnightsTour(currentSquare.doMove1(), newVisitedSquares, newTour) {\r\n        newTour.appendStart(currentSquare);\r\n        tour = newTour;\r\n        return true;\r\n      }\r\n      \r\n      // Repeat for the other knight&#39;s moves.\r\n    \r\n      else {\r\n        tour = null;\r\n        return false;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOr, in words: \r\n\r\n&gt; Recursively check all the squares a knight&#39;s move away from the current square, passing in both the new square and a new array of visited squares formed by adding the current square.  If there is a knight&#39;s tour from one of those squares, append the current square to the beginning of it to get a knight&#39;s tour from the current square.  \r\n\r\nRather than what you&#39;ve written which is: \r\n\r\n&gt; Recursively build up a knight&#39;s tour by starting at a square and (fairly arbitrarily) choosing a legal knight&#39;s move at each step.  If we get to a position where we can&#39;t do any more knight&#39;s moves, return `false`.  \r\n\r\nCan you see why the first (admittedly more complicated) recursive algorithm works and yours doesn&#39;t?  ","title":"Can someone help me with this knight&#39;s tour code?","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>The algorithm you have implemented is the following: </p>\n  \n  <p>Order the possible knight's moves from a square as follows: </p>\n  \n  <p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fMMOn.png\" height=\"250\"></p>\n  \n  <p>On each move, choose the lowest numbered move that is still allowed.  </p>\n  \n  <p>(A) If you cover all the squares, return <code>true</code>.</p>\n  \n  <p>(B) If you can no longer make a move, return <code>false</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are two problems with your code.

There are two reasons that this is not actually a recursive algorithm: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The <code>recursive</code> function is not idempotent - it has a side effect, which is to fill in a square of the <code>positionsVisited</code> array.  </li>\n<li>The <code>recursive</code> function calls on a global variable - <code>positionsVisited</code> (I say 'global variable', rather than 'private field', because what you have written is essentially procedural code).  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Instead, the function <code>recursive</code> should tell you a much more general piece of information: given a particular square on the chess board, and a particular set of squares which we are not allowed to visit, is there a knight's tour of the remaining squares?  (Of course, calling that function with the square a1 and an empty array of visited positions will tell you whether there is a knight's tour at all.)  The function can also return a string which will tell you what the knight's tour is.  </p>\n\n<p>The structure of the recursive function should then be something like the following: </p>\n\n<pre><code>private boolean isKnightsTour(Square currentSquare,\n                              int[9][9] visitedSquares,\n                              KnightsTour tour)\n{\n  // Append the current square to the array of visited squares.\n  int[9][9] newVisitedSquares = visitedSquares;\n  newVisitedSquares[currentSquare.getX()][currentSquare.getY()] = 1;\n\n  // If we have visited all the squares, there is a knight's tour.  \n  // Add some code here to check for that.\n  if (allSquaresVisited()) {\n    tour = new KnightsTour(currentSquare);\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  // Test all squares a knight's move away.  If you get a knight's tour, \n  // append the current square to the start and return that.  \n  KnightsTour newTour;\n  if (isKnightsTour(currentSquare.doMove1(), newVisitedSquares, newTour) {\n    newTour.appendStart(currentSquare);\n    tour = newTour;\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  // Repeat for the other knight's moves.\n\n  else {\n    tour = null;\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or, in words: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Recursively check all the squares a knight's move away from the current square, passing in both the new square and a new array of visited squares formed by adding the current square.  If there is a knight's tour from one of those squares, append the current square to the beginning of it to get a knight's tour from the current square.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rather than what you've written which is: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Recursively build up a knight's tour by starting at a square and (fairly arbitrarily) choosing a legal knight's move at each step.  If we get to a position where we can't do any more knight's moves, return <code>false</code>.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Can you see why the first (admittedly more complicated) recursive algorithm works and yours doesn't?  </p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2613188,"reputation":2601,"user_id":2262910,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Max Vasileuski"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1388773200,"creation_date":1388663696,"answer_id":20882372,"question_id":20880744,"body_markdown":"Except problem with &quot;all is visited&quot; check I see at least one more problem, which is in class fields.
