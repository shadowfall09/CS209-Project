In theory, the standard [`ImageIO` API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/imageio/package-summary.html) is all you need. You&#39;ll need to obtain both the meta data (`IIOMetadata`) and the pixels (as either `Raster` or `BufferedImage`). \r\n\r\nThe ICC profile will be part of the meta data.

For RGB JPEGs this is all you need.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the standard `JPEGImageReader` that is part of all Oracle or OpenJDK JREs does not support reading CMYK data as a `BufferedImage`. You will have to read as `Raster`. The raster will usually contain YCbCr or YCCK data, depending on the color transformation used when writing, so you might have to handle that transformation as well.

And finally write the meta data and the updated image data back. My JPEG plugin can also write CMYK JPEGs.\r\n\r\nFor everything Java 2D and `BufferedImage`/`Raster`-related operations, you are normally limited by the available (heap) memory (as well as the maximum array size in Java, should you have that much RAM).

I&#39;m sure JAI also have some options for this, but I generally don&#39;t recommend JAI for new code, as it seems completely left in the dark by Oracle.\r\n\r\nGood luck!

After a couple of days back and forth, I noticed that the highlight function wasn't working and mentioned that.  It turned out something was wrong with the IDE settings.  I still don't know specifically what was wrong but the fix in my case was to reset the IDE settings.  File-&gt;Manage IDE Settings-&gt;Restore Default settings.<br><br>\nAfter this, the green triangle start icon became visible to the left of my main function and things continued to work normally for subsequent projects.<br>\nThanks to Konstantin at JetBrain's support for his patience.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":7742839,"reputation":485,"user_id":5861873,"display_name":"lleiou"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":false,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1619109553,"creation_date":1619109553,"answer_id":67217434,"question_id":10654120,"body_markdown":"After creating your project in intelliJ, try running the following command:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nmvn package\r\n```","title":"Error: Could not find or load main class in intelliJ IDE","body":"<p>After creating your project in intelliJ, try running the following command:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-sh prettyprint-override\"><code>mvn package\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4404941,"reputation":121,"user_id":4161113,"display_name":"CuriousIndeed"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1621966130,"creation_date":1621965644,"answer_id":67693312,"question_id":10654120,"body_markdown":"If you are using gradle try rebuilding the project by the command from the command line:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngradle clean build \r\n```\r\n","title":"Error: Could not find or load main class in intelliJ IDE","body":"<p>If you are using gradle try rebuilding the project by the command from the command line:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-sh prettyprint-override\"><code>gradle clean build \n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1979094,"reputation":3912,"user_id":1776132,"display_name":"Smile"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1627045517,"creation_date":1627045517,"answer_id":68499665,"question_id":10654120,"body_markdown":"Invalidating cache didn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nI edited the main class java file with a dummy change and ran it.

Then user can select any student using the second drop-down.</p>\n<p>I want, when a user (a teacher) select a class from first drop-down, the second one should automatically be reset and when user clicks on the second drop-down, it should show all the students' names.</p>\n<p>My approach is:</p>\n<pre><code>class MyActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\n\n    List&lt;String&gt; classNames, studentNames;\n    ArrayAdapter&lt;String&gt; classAdapter, studentAdapter;\n    AutoCompleteTextView classDropDown, studentDropDown;\n\n    private void updateStudents(String selectedClass) {\n        studentNames.clear();\n        studentNames.addAll(getStudentNamesFromDB(selectedClass));\n        studentNames.notifyDataSetChanged();\n        // studentDropDown.setText(null); if I un-comment this line, then the above line &quot;notifyDataSetChanged&quot; doesn't work. It will show previous options only\n    }\n\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        classDropDown = findViewById(R.id.class_actv);\n        studentDropDown = findViewById(R.id.student_actv);\n\n        classNames = getClassNamesFromDatabase();\n        classAdapter = new ArrayAdapter(this, R.layout.dropdown_ui, R.id.tv, classNames);\n\n        studentNames = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();\n        studentAdapter = new ArrayAdapter(this, R.layout.dropdown_ui, R.id.tv, studentNames);\n\n        classDropDown.setAdapter(classAdapter);\n        studentDropDown.setAdapter(studentAdapter);\n\n        classDropDown.setOnItemClickListener(\n            @Override\n            public void onItemClick(AdapterView&lt;?&gt; parent, View view, int position, long id) {\n                Log.i(TAG, &quot;Selected class: &quot; + classNames.get(position));\n                String selectedClass = classNames.get(position);\n                updateStudents(selectedClass);\n            }\n        );\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The problem here is:\nSuppose someone first selected class 5, and selected a student from class 5. Now user realises his mistake and wants to select a student from another class (let's say class 6), when he selects class 6 from 1st drop-down, the value shown on the second view should be cleared automatically.</p>\n<p>With design, when I select class 6th, the previously selected name (student from class 5) still appears on the textView. I need that to be reset.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","hibernate","hql","hibernate-mapping","hibernate-criteria"],"owner":{"account_id":5624068,"reputation":1977,"user_id":4453027,"accept_rate":45,"display_name":"KJEjava48"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1700113098,"creation_date":1700035439,"question_id":77486064,"body_markdown":"[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][4]][4]\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][5]][5]\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][6]][6]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    @Entity\r\n    @Table(name = &quot;service_staff&quot;)\r\n    public class ServiceStaff implements Serializable {\r\n\r\n      @Id\r\n      @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\r\n      @Column(name = &quot;id&quot;)\r\n      private long id;\r\n\r\n      @JoinColumn(name = &quot;service_id&quot;, referencedColumnName = &quot;id&quot;, nullable = false)\r\n      @OneToOne(optional = false)\r\n      private Service serviceId;\r\n\r\n      @JoinColumn(name = &quot;user_id&quot;, referencedColumnName = &quot;id&quot;, nullable = true)\r\n      @OneToOne(optional = true)\r\n      private User userId;\r\n\r\n      @JoinColumn(name = &quot;designation_id&quot;, referencedColumnName = &quot;id&quot;, nullable = true)\r\n      @OneToOne(optional = true)\r\n      private Designation designationId;\r\n\r\n      @Column(name=&quot;head&quot;)\r\n      private boolean head;\r\n\r\n      @Column(name=&quot;head_type&quot;)\r\n      private int headType;\r\n\r\n      .......\r\n      \r\n    }\r\n\r\n      @Entity\r\n      @Table(name = &quot;project_staff&quot;)\r\n      public class ProjectStaff implements Serializable {\r\n\r\n          @Id\r\n          @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\r\n          @Column(name = &quot;id&quot;)\r\n          private long id;\r\n\r\n          @JoinColumn(name = &quot;project_id&quot;, referencedColumnName = &quot;id&quot;, nullable = false)\r\n          @OneToOne(optional = false)\r\n          private Project projectId;\r\n\r\n          @JoinColumn(name = &quot;user_id&quot;, referencedColumnName = &quot;id&quot;, nullable = true)\r\n          @OneToOne(optional = true)\r\n          private User userId;\r\n\r\n          @JoinColumn(name = &quot;designation_id&quot;, referencedColumnName = &quot;id&quot;, nullable = true)\r\n          @OneToOne(optional = true)\r\n          private Designation designationId;\r\n\r\n          @Column(name=&quot;head&quot;)\r\n          private boolean head;\r\n\r\n          @Column(name=&quot;head_type&quot;)\r\n          private int headType;\r\n\r\n          .......\r\n          \r\n      }\r\n\r\nAbove are some of the data tables on my project where I want to find the remaining list of data from &#39;ServiceStaff&#39; model class which are not exist on ProjectStaff class.

Doing so is almost always a programmer error, or otherwise not a proper usage of the API. These includes things like:\r\n\r\n* Methods on immutable types (e.g. `String`, `BigInteger`, etc) that return the _result_ of operations instead of mutating the instance it is invoked on.\r\n* Methods whose return value is a critical part of its behavior and should not be ignored, but people sometimes do anyway (e.g. [`InputStream.read(byte[])`](http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html#read%28byte%5B%5D%29) returns the number of bytes read, which should _NOT_ be assumed to be the entire length of the array)\r\n\r\nCurrently we can write codes that ignores these return values and have them compile and run without warning.

Which for me looks a little bit strange when we consider virtual threads.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","hashmap","parcelable"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3149313,"reputation":24760,"user_id":2738565,"accept_rate":29,"display_name":"Haresh Chhelana"},"score":1,"creation_date":1489732068,"post_id":42850514,"comment_id":72808642,"body_markdown":"Try to use Serializable instead of Parcelable.","body":"Try to use Serializable instead of Parcelable."},{"owner":{"account_id":5325360,"reputation":13423,"user_id":4247543,"display_name":"Rissmon Suresh"},"score":0,"creation_date":1489733371,"post_id":42850514,"comment_id":72809166,"body_markdown":"@HareshChhelana Why serializable??","body":"@HareshChhelana Why serializable??"},{"owner":{"account_id":3149313,"reputation":24760,"user_id":2738565,"accept_rate":29,"display_name":"Haresh Chhelana"},"score":2,"creation_date":1489733482,"post_id":42850514,"comment_id":72809207,"body_markdown":"@RissmonSuresh Don&#39;t need to write code for marshalling and unmarshalling.","body":"@RissmonSuresh Don&#39;t need to write code for marshalling and unmarshalling."},{"owner":{"account_id":4126107,"reputation":38403,"user_id":3385212,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"tynn"},"score":0,"creation_date":1489734665,"post_id":42850514,"comment_id":72809736,"body_markdown":"_Stuck_ is no reproducible state.

Try setting a timeout on the Socket connection for any ports to at least speed up the process somewhat...something like perhaps 50 milliseconds. I suppose it depends upon the system you have. You can do this by using the [Socket#connect()](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-socket-connect-method) method. Now, an IOException like `connect timed out`, `Permission denied:` (or `Connection refused`) basically means the port is **closed** or simply **not available** (which to you, may as well be considered as closed). Ports that generate an exception message of `Permission denied:` or `Connection refused` would be used by either System Hardware or Software and protected for their specific use only.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the best thing to do is to run the scan thought several [ExecutorService](https://www.baeldung.com/java-executor-service-tutorial) threads (like 3000 perhaps) to get the job done in maybe 30 to 40 seconds or so. Yes...your box will pump a little more blood for a bit, but, it beats waiting *all day* for the port scan to complete.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that you don&#39;t display closed or unavailable ports during scanning...it&#39;s a waste of time. Sending output to a Console Window takes a **lot** of unnecessary processing time. Just store open ports in a Collection of some sort then display that collection of open ports to the Console (or whatever) when the port scanning is done. The runnable demo code below makes use of a [LinkedHashMap](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html) so that the open port numbers inserted into the map remain in insertion order.\r\n\r\nUnless you modify the code to run through several threads, I would suggest you set the `portEnd` int variable to 1000 (or 2000) to get a good idea how long a scan of 65000 ports will take. It should be enough to feed you something for results (I hope).\r\n\r\nHere is the runnable demo code.

Try setting a timeout on the Socket connection for any ports to at least speed up the process somewhat...something like perhaps 50 milliseconds. I suppose it depends upon the system you have. You can do this by using the <a href=\"https://www.javatpoint.com/java-socket-connect-method\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Socket#connect()</a> method. Now, an IOException like <code>connect timed out</code>, <code>Permission denied:</code> (or <code>Connection refused</code>) basically means the port is <strong>closed</strong> or simply <strong>not available</strong> (which to you, may as well be considered as closed). Ports that generate an exception message of <code>Permission denied:</code> or <code>Connection refused</code> would be used by either System Hardware or Software and protected for their specific use only.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, the best thing to do is to run the scan thought several <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/java-executor-service-tutorial\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ExecutorService</a> threads (like 3000 perhaps) to get the job done in maybe 30 to 40 seconds or so. Yes...your box will pump a little more blood for a bit, but, it beats waiting <em>all day</em> for the port scan to complete.</p>\n<p>I would suggest that you don't display closed or unavailable ports during scanning...it's a waste of time. Sending output to a Console Window takes a <strong>lot</strong> of unnecessary processing time. Just store open ports in a Collection of some sort then display that collection of open ports to the Console (or whatever) when the port scanning is done. The runnable demo code below makes use of a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">LinkedHashMap</a> so that the open port numbers inserted into the map remain in insertion order.</p>\n<p>Unless you modify the code to run through several threads, I would suggest you set the <code>portEnd</code> int variable to 1000 (or 2000) to get a good idea how long a scan of 65000 ports will take. It should be enough to feed you something for results (I hope).</p>\n<p>Here is the runnable demo code.
