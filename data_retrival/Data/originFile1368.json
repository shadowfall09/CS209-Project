You cannot use request based or session scopes with Guice. If you don&#39;t need this then you are good to go, otherwise you need to integrate Guice Servlet Extensions and add the `GuiceFilter` in your `web.xml` as described in [the official Guice documentation][1]. You also need to make sure that you use the same injector instance in the `GuiceFilter` and the `SparkGuiceFilter` to do that you need to define a `GuiceServletContextListener` in your `web.xml` as described [here][2].\r\n\r\nYou can find a fully working example in my GitHub here [https://github.com/devng/demo/tree/master/sparkjava-guice][3]\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Servlets\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/ServletModule\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/devng/demo/tree/master/sparkjava-guice","title":"Does Java Spark provide any support for dependency injection or IoC containers?","body":"<p>It is quite easy to use Guice with Java Spark. Basically you need to extend the <code>SparkFilter</code> in the following way in order to create the Guice injector.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class SparkGuiceFilter extends SparkFilter {\n\n    private Injector injector = null;\n\n    @Override\n    protected SparkApplication[] getApplications(final FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {\n        final SparkApplication[] applications = super.getApplications(filterConfig);\n\n        if (this.injector == null) {\n            this.injector = Guice.createInjector(new MainModule());\n        }\n\n        if (applications != null &amp;&amp; applications.length != 0) {\n            for (SparkApplication application : applications) {\n                this.injector.injectMembers(application);\n            }\n        }\n\n        return applications;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then you need a <code>web.xml</code> and have to run your Spark application as a normal <code>war</code> application using Jetty or any other servlet container:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;web-app xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xmlns=\"http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee\"\n         xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd\"\n         version=\"3.0\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;filter&gt;\n        &lt;filter-name&gt;SparkGuiceFilter&lt;/filter-name&gt;\n        &lt;filter-class&gt;com.devng.spark.guice.SparkGuiceFilter&lt;/filter-class&gt;\n        &lt;init-param&gt;\n            &lt;param-name&gt;applicationClass&lt;/param-name&gt;\n            &lt;param-value&gt;com.devng.spark.SparkApp&lt;/param-value&gt;\n        &lt;/init-param&gt;\n    &lt;/filter&gt;\n    &lt;filter-mapping&gt;\n        &lt;filter-name&gt;SparkGuiceFilter&lt;/filter-name&gt;\n        &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\n    &lt;/filter-mapping&gt;\n&lt;/web-app&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, there are some limitations with this approach. You cannot use request based or session scopes with Guice. If you don't need this then you are good to go, otherwise you need to integrate Guice Servlet Extensions and add the <code>GuiceFilter</code> in your <code>web.xml</code> as described in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Servlets\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the official Guice documentation</a>.

But I kinda dislike the name `setPile` if that&#39;s what happens.\r\n\r\n3. DominoPile becomes immutable, all set methods need to go away, all data structures become immutable, and a method like `.getOutLastOne` doesn&#39;t actually remove anything (it can&#39;t - everything cannot be modified), instead it makes an entirely new DominoPile object that is a clone of itself, except with one domino removed.

So, only the order of the `NestPath` elements in `ISeq&lt;NestPath&gt;` defines the fitness, right? The fitness function is not responsible for altering your objects, via side effects.\r\n\r\nI also don&#39;t understand what you mean with _rotate_ the genotype. A `Genotype` in _Jenetics_ is _just_ a sequence of chromosomes. Maybe you can explain your optimization problem in a greater detail.\r\n\r\n**Some comments to your code itself**\r\n\r\n* The `NFP_Nesting::of` does a shuffling of the given `List&lt;NestPath&gt;`. This is not necessary.\r\n* Doing some updates with `.peek(NFP_Nesting::update)` also looks suspicious. If you need to update your `NestPath` objects, you no longer doing a permutation optimization.

I&#39;ve taken a look at several solutions on this site and nothing seems to be working for me. I&#39;ve tried several instances of the code included below, using URL and inputStreams, with full path names, reduced path names, and automating the path names using system.getProperty(&quot;user.dir&quot;); I&#39;ve tried alternating between forward and backslashes, doubling up on backslashes and the like.\r\nI also understand that accessing an image in a .jar is not the same as locating a file and it&#39;s path.\r\n\r\nCode I&#39;ve tried using:\r\n```\r\nurl = getClass().getResource(&quot;/ball.PNG&quot;);\r\ntry {\r\n    image = ImageIO.read(url);\r\n} catch (IOException e) {\r\n    e.printStackTrace();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\ntry {\r\n    image = ImageIO.read(this.getClass().getResource(&quot;/ball.PNG&quot;));\r\n    if (image == null){\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Could not find image for the ball!&quot;);\r\n}\r\ncatch (IOException e) {\r\n    e.printStackTrace();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nInputStream input = getClass().getResourceAsStream(&quot;ball.PNG&quot;);\r\ntry{\r\n\timage = ImageIO.read(input);\r\n}\r\ncatch(IOException e){\r\n\te.printStackTrace();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNone of these solutions are working. compiling and running works just fine. The jar file is made just fine, and when I look inside, the PNG I used is included. Actually running the .Jar file gives me the error &quot;Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: input == null!&quot; along with a few more lines that just indicate that errors occur when trying to pull information from the image. \r\n\r\nThe most interesting part to me is that most of these solutions work in some form or another when running the .class files, but none work for the .jar file.\r\n\r\nFor more context, the variable image is a BufferedImage; I&#39;ve been using Notepad++ and command prompt to run, compile and create the .class and .Jar without issues. There is no subdirectory for the image files, and again after checking, they are included in the .jar file.

I've taken a look at several solutions on this site and nothing seems to be working for me. I've tried several instances of the code included below, using URL and inputStreams, with full path names, reduced path names, and automating the path names using system.getProperty(&quot;user.dir&quot;); I've tried alternating between forward and backslashes, doubling up on backslashes and the like.\nI also understand that accessing an image in a .jar is not the same as locating a file and it's path.</p>\n<p>Code I've tried using:</p>\n<pre><code>url = getClass().getResource(&quot;/ball.PNG&quot;);\ntry {\n    image = ImageIO.read(url);\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>try {\n    image = ImageIO.read(this.getClass().getResource(&quot;/ball.PNG&quot;));\n    if (image == null){\n    System.out.println(&quot;Could not find image for the ball!&quot;);\n}\ncatch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>InputStream input = getClass().getResourceAsStream(&quot;ball.PNG&quot;);\ntry{\n    image = ImageIO.read(input);\n}\ncatch(IOException e){\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>None of these solutions are working. compiling and running works just fine. The jar file is made just fine, and when I look inside, the PNG I used is included. Actually running the .Jar file gives me the error &quot;Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: input == null!&quot; along with a few more lines that just indicate that errors occur when trying to pull information from the image.</p>\n<p>The most interesting part to me is that most of these solutions work in some form or another when running the .class files, but none work for the .jar file.</p>\n<p>For more context, the variable image is a BufferedImage; I've been using Notepad++ and command prompt to run, compile and create the .class and .Jar without issues. There is no subdirectory for the image files, and again after checking, they are included in the .jar file. I have no idea why the .class files can find the images and use them but the .jar files cannot.\nI know the code isn't pretty to look at and a bit incomplete, but keep in mind that these are just quick examples I've written up. Compiling and running works just fine, as does running the jar files. Only the .jar file has trouble locating the image file.

To address this, all output stream\nclasses provide a flush() method, which requests that all accumulated data be written immediately to disk.</p>\n<p>The flush() method helps reduce the amount of data lost if the\napplication terminates unexpectedly. It is not without cost,\nthough. Each time it is used, it may cause a noticeable delay in\nthe application, especially for large files.
