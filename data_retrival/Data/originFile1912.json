It _also_ does it for you if you get out of the `{}` of the `try` via a `return` statement, via control flow (`break`), or via an exception, or just by running to the `}` and exiting normally. No matter how - the resource is closed. As it should be.\r\n\r\n## It throws description-less exceptions\r\n\r\n`else throw new IOException();` is no good; add a description that explains _why_ the exception happened. `throw new IOException(&quot;File not found&quot;)` is better, but `throw new FileNotFoundException(f.toString())` is even better: The message should convey useful information and nothing more than that (in other words, `throw new IOException(&quot;Something went wrong&quot;)` is horrible, don&#39;t do that, that message adds no useful information), should not end in punctuation (`throw new IOException(&quot;File not found!&quot;)` is bad), and should throw a type that is most appropriate (if the file isn&#39;t there, `FileNotFoundException`, which is a subtype of `IOException`, is more appropriate, obviously).\r\n\r\n## It commits the __capital offense__\r\n\r\nYou should not ever write a catch block whose contents are just `e.printStackTrace();`. __This is always wrong__.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what you do with a checked exception:\r\n\r\n1. First, think of what the exception means and whether the nature of your method inherently implies that this exception can occur (vs. that it is an implementation detail). In this case, you didn&#39;t show us what the method containing that try/catch stuff even does. But let&#39;s say it is called `appendFile`, __obviously__ a method that includes the text &#39;file&#39; does I/O, and therefore, that method __should__ be declared with `throws IOException`. It&#39;s not an implementation detail that a method named `appendFile` interacts with files. It is its nature.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat in the eye of the beholder. Imagine a method named `saveGame`. That&#39;s less clear; perhaps the mechanism to save may involve a database instead, in which case `SQLException` would be normal. That&#39;s an example of a method where &#39;it interacts with the file system&#39; is an implementation detail.\r\n\r\n2. The problem that the exception signals is logical, but needs to be more abstract.\r\n\r\nSee the above: A save file system can obviously fail to save, but the exact nature of the error is abstract: If the save file system is DB-based, errors would show up in the form of an `SQLException`; if a file system, `IOException`, etcetera. However, the idea that saving may fail, and that the code that tried to save has a reasonable chance that it can somewhat recover from this, is obvious. If it&#39;s a game, there&#39;s a user interface; you should most absolutely TELL the player that saving failed, instead of shunting some stack trace into sysout which they probably never even look at! Telling the user that something failed is one way of handling things, not always the best, but here it applies).\r\n\r\nIn such cases, __make your own exception type__ and throw that, using the wrapper constructor:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class SaveException extends Exception {\r\n  public SaveException(Throwable cause) {\r\n    super(cause);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// and to use:\r\n\r\npublic void save() throws SaveException {\r\n  try {\r\n    try (OutputStream out = Files.newOutputStream(savePath)) {\r\n      game.saveTo(out);\r\n    }\r\n  } catch (IOException e) {\r\n    throw new SaveException(e);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. If neither applies, then perhaps the exception is either essentially not handleable or not expectable or nearly always a bug. For example, writing to an outputstream that you _know_ is a `ByteArrayOutputStream` (which can&#39;t throw), trying to load the `UTF-8` charset (which is guaranteed by the JVM spec and therefore cannot possibly throw `NoSuchCharsetException`) - those are not expectable. Something like `Pattern.compile(&quot;Some-regexp-here&quot;)` can fail (not all strings are valid regexps), but as the vast majority of regexes in java are literals written by a programmer, any error in them is therefore neccessarily a bug. Those, too, are properly done as RuntimeExceptions (which are exceptions you don&#39;t have to catch or list in your `throws` line). Not handleables are mostly an application logic level thing. All fair game for runtimeexceptions. Make your own or use something that applies:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic void save(int saveSlot) {\r\n  if (saveSlot &lt; 1 || saveSlot &gt; 9) throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Choose a saveslot from 1 to 9&quot;);\r\n  // ... rest of code.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis really feels like door number one: Whatever method this is in probably needs to be declared as `throws IOException` and do no catching or trying at all.\r\n\r\n## Minor nit: Uses old API\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s new API for file stuff in the `java.nio.file` package. It&#39;s &#39;better&#39;, in that the old API does a bunch of bad things, such as returning failure by way of a `boolean` flag instead of doing it right (by throwing an exception), and the new API has far more support for various bits and bobs of what file systems do, such as support for file links and creation timestamps.\r\n","title":"Are exceptions well handeled in this code?

For other numeric fields four pattern letters means a field of width exactly 4. For years it means a *minimum field width* of 4.

It basically allows the *first* (and only the first) of a series of fields with no delimiters between them to have variable width when all other fields have fixed widths.

The `appendValue` method of the builder can do this.\r\n\r\nSo how come `yy` worked when `yyyy` did not?

For parsing, this will parse using the base\r\n&gt; value of 2000, resulting in a year within the range 2000 to 2099\r\n&gt; inclusive. If the count of letters is less than four (but not two),\r\n&gt; then the sign is only output for negative years as per\r\n&gt; `SignStyle.NORMAL`.

These concepts are not Java concepts;  you would have the same issues in any other language.\r\n\r\nFirst, you are destroying your process before it runs, and possibly before it even gets started.  This is because `pb.start()` starts the process, and then you immediately destroy it without giving it a chance to complete.\r\n\r\nYou shouldn’t need to destroy the process at all.  Just let it finish:\r\n\r\n    Process start = pb.start();\r\n    start.waitFor();\r\n\r\nAll processes have their own *standard input* and *standard output.*  Again, this is not a Java concept;  this has been a fundamental feature in Unix and Windows operating systems for a long time.\r\n\r\nNormally, when a process prints information by writing it to its standard output.  That is in fact what Java’s `System.out.println` does.  In Unix shells (and in Windows), the `&gt;` character redirects the standard output of a process to a file;  the program still writes to its standard output, without ever knowing that the operating system is sending that output to a destination other than the terminal.

To get the same set of raw bits with Java, you need to use [Mersenne Twister for Java from Apache](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/javadocs/api-3.3/org/apache/commons/math3/random/MersenneTwister.html). MT generates unsigned 32-bit integers which then can be transformed into other ranges or distributions. If a number with 64-bit precision is needed, the implementation implicitly invokes the random number generator twice and combines the result.\r\n\r\nHowever, It seems that the number representation in NumPy and Java are different, therefore it is not enough to get the same random bits.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s use MT both in Java and python, and compare the results.

route locations, add different iot devices etc..</p>\n<p>I've downloaded the zip, setup my intelliJ environment and tried to build and run but I keep getting various errors the most predominant being:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.RuntimeException: Error running truck stream generator\nat

&quot;getPath&quot; stuff in lab.java:</p>\n<pre><code>    sensorEventsParam.setNumberOfEvents(1000);\n    sensorEventsParam.setDelayBetweenEvents(delayBetweenEventsMs);\n

sensorEventsGenerator.generateTruckEventsStream(sensorEventsParam);\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'm guessing it's how the path is handled because the error in sensorEventsGenerator.generateTruckEvenetsStream also points at the getRouteDirectory which again goes back to the setRouteDirectory in the sensorEventsParam...</p>\n<p>Anyways any insight or help anyone can give me would be greatly
