So how to make them asynchronous cause I hope the <code>process((ByteBuf) msg)</code> will not affect the writing of messages to the remote server.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","realm"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2806090,"reputation":80148,"user_id":2413303,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"EpicPandaForce"},"score":0,"creation_date":1496959148,"post_id":44443084,"comment_id":75889984,"body_markdown":"`add a field with the date and extract and compare it to decide if delete` yeah you can do `realm.where(MyClass.class).lowerThan(&quot;date&quot;, someDate).findAll().deleteAllFromRealm()`","body":"<code>add a field with the date and extract and compare it to decide if delete</code> yeah you can do <code>realm.where(MyClass.class).lowerThan(&quot;date&quot;, someDate).findAll().deleteAllFromRealm()</code>"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2806090,"reputation":80148,"user_id":2413303,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"EpicPandaForce"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":10,"is_accepted":false,"score":9,"last_activity_date":1504219919,"creation_date":1503605006,"answer_id":45870017,"question_id":44443084,"body_markdown":"Add a field with the date and query the ones you want to delete based on that \r\n\r\nThen you can do \r\n\r\n     realm.where(MyClass.class)\r\n        .lowerThan(&quot;date&quot;, someDate)\r\n        .findAll()\r\n        .deleteAllFromRealm()\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\n\r\n&gt; The question is whether there is any other way to automatically remove old objects from Realm, such as a condition when we store data, a parameter, a configuration or a Realm method, and not just compare each time. \r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n&gt;  **It is obvious that with a query we can eliminate any object that we want.**\r\n\r\nThe linked Swift-based answer does the exact same thing.","title":"Clean up old Realm objects?","body":"<p>Add a field with the date and query the ones you want to delete based on that </p>\n\n<p>Then you can do </p>\n\n<pre><code> realm.where(MyClass.class)\n    .lowerThan(\"date\", someDate)\n    .findAll()\n    .deleteAllFromRealm()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The question is whether there is any other way to automatically remove old objects from Realm, such as a condition when we store data, a parameter, a configuration or a Realm method, and not just compare each time. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>It is obvious that with a query we can eliminate any object that we want.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The linked Swift-based answer does the exact same thing.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":7056940,"reputation":226,"user_id":5403866,"display_name":"A.jiji"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":true,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1503683391,"creation_date":1503683391,"answer_id":45886977,"question_id":44443084,"body_markdown":"Nope, there is not such functionality in Realm itself. \r\n\r\nYour alternative is good but I do not recommend to use background service for deleting data, so check/delete data when you query.","title":"Clean up old Realm objects?","body":"<p>Nope, there is not such functionality in Realm itself. </p>\n\n<p>Your alternative is good but I do not recommend to use background service for deleting data, so check/delete data when you query.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":10688670,"reputation":3585,"user_id":8533971,"accept_rate":43,"display_name":"Aditya"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1504239570,"creation_date":1504002158,"answer_id":45936631,"question_id":44443084,"body_markdown":"Yupp you can delete old realm data just like this,\r\n\r\n    realmConfiguration = new RealmConfiguration.Builder().build();\r\n    Realm.deleteRealm(realmConfiguration);\r\n    realm = Realm.getInstance(realmConfiguration);\r\n\r\nIn above lines, second line that is\r\n\r\n    Realm.deleteRealm(realmConfiguration);\r\n\r\nperform deleting  old realm data.

So I put this dependency:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n        &lt;!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sun.mail/jakarta.mail --&gt;\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;com.sun.mail&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jakarta.mail&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;2.0.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n… into this Maven POM:\r\n\r\n```iml\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;project xmlns = &quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0&quot;\r\n         xmlns:xsi = &quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\r\n         xsi:schemaLocation = &quot;http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;groupId&gt;work.basil.example&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;JMail&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;name&gt;JMail&lt;/name&gt;\r\n    &lt;!-- FIXME change it to the project&#39;s website --&gt;\r\n    &lt;url&gt;http://www.example.com&lt;/url&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;properties&gt;\r\n        &lt;project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;UTF-8&lt;/project.build.sourceEncoding&gt;\r\n        &lt;maven.compiler.release&gt;17&lt;/maven.compiler.release&gt;\r\n    &lt;/properties&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;dependencies&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter-api --&gt;\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.junit.jupiter&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;junit-jupiter-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;5.8.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n            &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sun.mail/jakarta.mail --&gt;\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;com.sun.mail&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;jakarta.mail&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;2.0.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;/dependencies&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;build&gt;\r\n        &lt;pluginManagement&gt;&lt;!-- lock down plugins versions to avoid using Maven defaults (may be moved to parent pom) --&gt;\r\n            &lt;plugins&gt;\r\n                &lt;!-- clean lifecycle, see https://maven.apache.org/ref/current/maven-core/lifecycles.html#clean_Lifecycle --&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-clean-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.1.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;!-- default lifecycle, jar packaging: see https://maven.apache.org/ref/current/maven-core/default-bindings.html#Plugin_bindings_for_jar_packaging --&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-resources-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.2.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-compiler-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.8.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-surefire-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.0.0-M5&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-jar-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.2.0&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-install-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.0.0-M1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-deploy-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.0.0-M1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;!-- site lifecycle, see https://maven.apache.org/ref/current/maven-core/lifecycles.html#site_Lifecycle --&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-site-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.9.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-project-info-reports-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;3.1.2&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n            &lt;/plugins&gt;\r\n        &lt;/pluginManagement&gt;\r\n    &lt;/build&gt;\r\n&lt;/project&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n… to create a little project. I added the `Registry` class from [here][8], a link provided [here][9].\r\n\r\nMinor note: I fixed a typo to change the class name from `registry` to `Registry` per Java naming conventions. \r\n\r\nNotice the imports on that file use `jakarta.*` package naming.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport java.util.*;\r\n\r\nimport jakarta.mail.*;\r\nimport jakarta.mail.internet.*;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat `Registry` class compiles, but I did not run it.\r\n\r\n### Deployment\r\n\r\nIf you are writing a standalone app, you need to **include a JAR** containing an implementation. You would ship that JAR as part of your app, provided you can abide by its license.\r\n\r\nIf you are writing a web app or web service to be deployed on a Jakarta EE service, then you would change your **Maven POM to use the Jakarta Mail APIs** alone without an implementation. The implementation would be provided at runtime by the Jakarta EE compliant server product you chose for deployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/69561045/642706\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Foundation\r\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Mail\r\n  [5]: https://jakarta.ee/specifications/mail/\r\n  [6]: https://jakarta.ee/specifications/mail/2.0/\r\n  [7]: https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/mail/\r\n  [8]: https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/mail/releases/download/2.0.1/jakartamail-samples.zip\r\n  [9]: https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/mail/#Samples","title":"Java Mail Application","body":"<p>The <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/69561045/642706\">Answer by Mustafa</a> seems correct but is outdated.</p>\n<h1><em>Jakarta EE</em></h1>\n<p><em>JavaEE</em> was owned by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Oracle Corporation</a>.

That's it - the remaining case (they are equal) will loop.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":162699,"reputation":138060,"user_id":3788176,"accept_rate":54,"display_name":"Andy Turner"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1634219178,"creation_date":1634217210,"answer_id":69571367,"question_id":69571240,"body_markdown":"Your for loop never executes for more than one iteration: all three branches of the conditional contain a `return` statement.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; Math.min(o1.size(), o2.size()); ++i) {\r\n    //Checking the order of the number \r\n    if (o1.get(i) &lt; o2.get(i)) {\r\n        return -1;\r\n    } else if (o1.get(i) &gt; o2.get(i)) {\r\n        return 1;\r\n    } else {\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo, all you are doing is comparing the first elements of the two lists.\r\n\r\nRemove the `return 0;` in the final case.\r\n\r\nYou may instead find it neater to write the comparator body as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; Math.min(o1.size(), o2.size()); ++i) {\r\n  int cmp = Integer.compare(o1.get(i), o2.get(i));\r\n  if (cmp != 0) {\r\n    return cmp;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nreturn Integer.compare(o1.size(), o2.size());\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIn terms of writing your existing code as suggested (&quot;you may find it neater&quot;), the original code is equivalent to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (!o1.isEmpty() &amp;&amp; !o2.isEmpty()) {\r\n  return Integer.compare(o1.get(0), o2.get(0));\r\n}\r\nreturn Integer.compare(o1.size(), o2.size());\r\n```","title":"How to check whether list is present inside list in the java","body":"<p>Your for loop never executes for more than one iteration: all three branches of the conditional contain a <code>return</code> statement.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; Math.min(o1.size(), o2.size()); ++i) {\n    //Checking the order of the number \n    if (o1.get(i) &lt; o2.get(i)) {\n        return -1;\n    } else if (o1.get(i) &gt; o2.get(i)) {\n        return 1;\n    } else {\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, all you are doing is comparing the first elements of the two lists.</p>\n<p>Remove the <code>return 0;</code> in the final case.</p>\n<p>You may instead find it neater to write the comparator body as:</p>\n<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; Math.min(o1.size(), o2.size()); ++i) {\n  int cmp = Integer.compare(o1.get(i), o2.get(i));\n  if (cmp != 0) {\n    return cmp;\n  }\n}\nreturn Integer.compare(o1.size(), o2.size());\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<p>In terms of writing your existing code as suggested (&quot;you may find it neater&quot;), the original code is equivalent to:</p>\n<pre><code>if (!o1.isEmpty() &amp;&amp; !o2.isEmpty()) {\n  return Integer.compare(o1.get(0), o2.get(0));\n}\nreturn Integer.compare(o1.size(), o2.size());\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":23031133,"reputation":1,"user_id":17150602,"display_name":"Toloy"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1634218035,"creation_date":1634218035,"answer_id":69571585,"question_id":69571240,"body_markdown":"The problem here lies on the comparator.

There are a lot of duplicates, and possibly even unwanted cartesian products, and it might not even be possible to be sure what nested collection belongs to a parent value. In your case, it would be possible, but very wasteful both on the server and on the client. The values of `A` would be repeated many many times.\r\n\r\nSome workarounds have been implemented, including by third parties (for jOOQ). Alternatives include running several queries and connecting the values afterwards. All of them very tedious.\r\n\r\nLuckily, jOOQ 3.14+ offers support for nesting collections out of the box!\r\n\r\n### A jOOQ 3.14 approach using SQL/JSON\r\n\r\n[The jOOQ 3.14 appraoch to nesting collections is using SQL/JSON][1] behind the scenes (or SQL/XML, but in your case, JSON seems more appropriate).\r\n\r\nFrom your question, I don&#39;t see why you need the POJO intermediate step, so perhaps you can bypass that and generate the JSON directly in the database. If not, see below.\r\n\r\nWrite this query:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nctx\r\n  .select(\r\n    // Optionally, wrap this level in jsonArrayAgg(jsonObject()) too, like the others\r\n    A.NAME,\r\n    field(\r\n      select(jsonArrayAgg(jsonObject(\r\n        key(&quot;name&quot;).value(B.NAME),\r\n        key(&quot;list_of_c&quot;).value(\r\n          select(jsonArrayAgg(jsonObject(\r\n            key(&quot;name&quot;).value(C.NAME),\r\n            key(&quot;list_of_d&quot;).value(\r\n              select(jsonArrayAgg(jsonObject(\r\n                key(&quot;name&quot;).value(D.NAME),\r\n                key(&quot;list_of_e&quot;).value(\r\n                  select(jsonArrayAgg(jsonObject(key(&quot;name&quot;).value(E.NAME))))\r\n                  .from(E)\r\n                  .where(E.D_ID.eq(D.ID))\r\n                )\r\n              )))\r\n              .from(D)\r\n              .where(D.C_ID.eq(C.ID))\r\n            )\r\n          )))\r\n          .from(C)\r\n          .where(C.B_ID.eq(B.ID))\r\n        )\r\n      )))\r\n      .from(B)\r\n      .where(B.A_ID.eq(A.ID))\r\n    ).as(&quot;list_of_b&quot;)\r\n  )\r\n  .from(A)\r\n  .fetch();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe usual static import is assumed:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport static ord.jooq.impl.DSL.*;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince jOOQ is all about [dynamic SQL][2], chances are, you can automate some of the nesting with dynamic SQL.\r\n\r\nAll of the above also works with `JSONB` in PostgreSQL, just use [`jsonbArrayAgg()`][3] and [`jsonbObject()`][4] instead.\r\n\r\nNote that `JSON_ARRAYAGG()` aggregates empty sets into `NULL`, not into an empty `[]`. [If that&#39;s a problem, use `COALESCE()`][11]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Mapping the above into POJOs\r\n\r\nIf you have Jackson or Gson on your classpath, you can now just write [`fetchInto(APojo.class)`][5] at the end to map the resulting JSON tree. But you&#39;re probably just going to map the POJOs back into JSON again using either Jackson or Gson, so from a high level, I don&#39;t think you get a lot of value out of this step.\r\n\r\n### The jOOQ 3.15 approach to nesting collections\r\n\r\nStarting from jOOQ 3.15, a number of improvements to type safe mapping and nesting collections will be implemented\r\n\r\n- [#3884][6] `MULTISET` and `ARRAY` constructor from subquery support (finally!)\r\n- [#7100][7] Ad-hoc `Field` data type conversion convenience\r\n- [#11804][8] Type safe mapping of `Record[N]` types to constructor references\r\n- [#11812][9] Support for nested `ROW` expressions in projections\r\n\r\nWith all of the above, in case you really *need* your POJO intermediary step (and assuming you will have the necessary &quot;immutable constructors&quot; on your POJOs, e.g. like canonical record constructors in Java 16+). E.g.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nrecord EPojo (String name) {}\r\nrecord DPojo (String name, EPojo[] listOfE) {}\r\nrecord CPojo (String name, DPojo[] listOfD) {}\r\nrecord BPojo (String name, CPojo[] listOfC) {}\r\nrecord APojo (String name, BPojo[] listOfB) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that case, you will be able to write something like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nctx\r\n  .select(A.NAME, array(\r\n     select(row(B.NAME, array(\r\n       select(row(C.NAME, array(\r\n         select(row(D.NAME, array(\r\n           select(row(E.NAME).mapping(EPojo::new))\r\n           .from(E)\r\n           .where(E.D_ID.eq(D.ID))\r\n         )).mapping(DPojo::new))\r\n         .from(D)\r\n         .where(D.C_ID.eq(C.ID))\r\n       )).mapping(CPojo::new))\r\n       .from(C)\r\n       .where(C.B_ID.eq(B.ID))\r\n     )).mapping(BPojo::new))\r\n     .from(B)\r\n     .where(B.A_ID.eq(A.ID))\r\n  )\r\n  .from(A)\r\n  .fetch(Records.mapping(APojo::new));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you prefer `List&lt;SomePojo&gt;` over `SomePojo[]`, then you&#39;d just have to use the new ad-hoc conversion from arrays to list on the array expressions, e.g.\r\n\r\n```java\r\narray(select(...)).convertFrom(Arrays::asList)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll update this part of the answer, once the API has stabilised.\r\n\r\n### Further outlook\r\n\r\nSince these types of &quot;nested collection joins&quot; will become very common in jOOQ, irrespective of whether SQL collections are nested in SQL, or JSON collections, or XML collections, future versions of jOOQ will probably offer a more convenient syntax, [similar to the implicit join syntax for ordinary to-one joins][10].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://blog.jooq.org/2020/10/09/nesting-collections-with-jooq-3-14s-sql-xml-or-sql-json-support/\r\n  [2]: https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-building/dynamic-sql/\r\n  [3]: https://www.jooq.org/javadoc/latest/org.jooq/org/jooq/impl/DSL.html#jsonbArrayAgg(org.jooq.Field)\r\n  [4]: https://www.jooq.org/javadoc/latest/org.jooq/org/jooq/impl/DSL.html#jsonbObject(org.jooq.JSONEntry...)\r\n  [5]: https://www.jooq.org/javadoc/latest/org.jooq/org/jooq/ResultQuery.html#fetchInto(java.lang.Class)\r\n  [6]: https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/issues/3884\r\n  [7]: https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/issues/7100\r\n  [8]: https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/issues/11804\r\n  [9]: https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/issues/11812\r\n  [10]: https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-building/sql-statements/select-statement/implicit-join/\r\n  [11]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/67932476/521799","title":"How to Fetch Multiple Level One to many Nesting with Jooq","body":"<h3>The <code>JOIN</code> approach</h3>\n<p>Historically, most ORMs attempted to nest collections in some way using joins, since joins have been the only widely supported way of &quot;connecting&quot; collections (but not nesting them) in SQL.

If not, see below.</p>\n<p>Write this query:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>ctx\n  .select(\n    // Optionally, wrap this level in jsonArrayAgg(jsonObject()) too, like the others\n    A.NAME,\n    field(\n      select(jsonArrayAgg(jsonObject(\n        key(&quot;name&quot;).value(B.NAME),\n        key(&quot;list_of_c&quot;).value(\n          select(jsonArrayAgg(jsonObject(\n            key(&quot;name&quot;).value(C.NAME),\n            key(&quot;list_of_d&quot;).value(\n              select(jsonArrayAgg(jsonObject(\n                key(&quot;name&quot;).value(D.NAME),\n                key(&quot;list_of_e&quot;).value(\n                  select(jsonArrayAgg(jsonObject(key(&quot;name&quot;).value(E.NAME))))\n                  .from(E)\n                  .where(E.D_ID.eq(D.ID))\n                )\n              )))\n              .from(D)\n              .where(D.C_ID.eq(C.ID))\n            )\n          )))\n          .from(C)\n          .where(C.B_ID.eq(B.ID))\n        )\n      )))\n      .from(B)\n      .where(B.A_ID.eq(A.ID))\n    ).as(&quot;list_of_b&quot;)\n  )\n  .from(A)\n  .fetch();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The usual static import is assumed:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import static ord.jooq.impl.DSL.*;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since jOOQ is all about <a href=\"https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-building/dynamic-sql/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dynamic SQL</a>, chances are, you can automate some of the nesting with dynamic SQL.</p>\n<p>All of the above also works with <code>JSONB</code> in PostgreSQL, just use <a href=\"https://www.jooq.org/javadoc/latest/org.jooq/org/jooq/impl/DSL.html#jsonbArrayAgg(org.jooq.Field)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>jsonbArrayAgg()</code></a> and <a href=\"https://www.jooq.org/javadoc/latest/org.jooq/org/jooq/impl/DSL.html#jsonbObject(org.jooq.JSONEntry...)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>jsonbObject()</code></a> instead.</p>\n<p>Note that <code>JSON_ARRAYAGG()</code> aggregates empty sets into <code>NULL</code>, not into an empty <code>[]</code>. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/67932476/521799\">If that's a problem, use <code>COALESCE()</code></a></p>\n<h3>Mapping the above into POJOs</h3>\n<p>If you have Jackson or Gson on your classpath, you can now just write <a href=\"https://www.jooq.org/javadoc/latest/org.jooq/org/jooq/ResultQuery.html#fetchInto(java.lang.Class)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>fetchInto(APojo.class)</code></a> at the end to map the resulting JSON tree. But you're probably just going to map the POJOs back into JSON again using either Jackson or Gson, so from a high level, I don't think you get a lot of value out of this step.</p>\n<h3>The jOOQ 3.15 approach to nesting collections</h3>\n<p>Starting from jOOQ 3.15, a number of improvements to type safe mapping and nesting collections will be implemented</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/issues/3884\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">#3884</a> <code>MULTISET</code> and <code>ARRAY</code> constructor from subquery support (finally!)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/issues/7100\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">#7100</a> Ad-hoc <code>Field</code> data type conversion convenience</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/issues/11804\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">#11804</a> Type safe mapping of <code>Record[N]</code> types to constructor references</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOQ/issues/11812\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">#11812</a> Support for nested <code>ROW</code> expressions in projections</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With all of the above, in case you really <em>need</em> your POJO intermediary step (and assuming you will have the necessary &quot;immutable constructors&quot; on your POJOs, e.g. like canonical record constructors in Java 16+). E.g.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>record EPojo (String name) {}\nrecord DPojo (String name, EPojo[] listOfE) {}\nrecord CPojo (String name, DPojo[] listOfD) {}\nrecord BPojo (String name, CPojo[] listOfC) {}\nrecord APojo (String name, BPojo[] listOfB) {}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In that case, you will be able to write something like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>ctx\n  .select(A.NAME, array(\n     select(row(B.NAME, array(\n       select(row(C.NAME, array(\n         select(row(D.NAME, array(\n           select(row(E.NAME).mapping(EPojo::new))\n           .from(E)\n           .where(E.D_ID.eq(D.ID))\n         )).mapping(DPojo::new))\n         .from(D)\n         .where(D.C_ID.eq(C.ID))\n       )).mapping(CPojo::new))\n       .from(C)\n       .where(C.B_ID.eq(B.ID))\n     )).mapping(BPojo::new))\n     .from(B)\n     .where(B.A_ID.eq(A.ID))\n  )\n  .from(A)\n  .fetch(Records.mapping(APojo::new));\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you prefer <code>List&lt;SomePojo&gt;</code> over <code>SomePojo[]</code>, then you'd just have to use the new ad-hoc conversion from arrays to list on the array expressions, e.g.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>array(select(...)).convertFrom(Arrays::asList)\n</code></pre>\n<p>I'll update this part of the answer, once the API has stabilised.</p>\n<h3>Further outlook</h3>\n<p>Since these types of &quot;nested collection joins&quot; will become very common in jOOQ, irrespective of whether SQL collections are nested in SQL, or JSON collections, or XML collections, future versions of jOOQ will probably offer a more convenient syntax, <a href=\"https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-building/sql-statements/select-statement/implicit-join/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">similar to the implicit join syntax for ordinary to-one joins</a>.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":2414037,"reputation":446,"user_id":2108502,"display_name":"Hrishi"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":2166,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"answer_count":1,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1634216711,"creation_date":1620216047,"question_id":67400869,"body_markdown":"Here is the Scenario, I have 5 tables having one to many relations with each other, I have to map result data in hierarchical manner in below given Pojos with Jooq.\r\n\r\nDB Tables are a, b, c, d, e\r\n\r\n    // Here are response Pojo&#39;s\r\n    Class APojo {\r\n      public string name;\r\n      public List&lt;BPojo&gt;

All of this is quite straightforward and automatic, as soon as you have either JAXB, Gson, or Jackson on your classpath.\r\n\r\nAn example for your data structures:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ndsl.select(\r\n      HEAD.ID,\r\n      field(\r\n        select(jsonArrayAgg(jsonObject(\r\n          key(&quot;id&quot;).value(POSITION.ID),\r\n          key(&quot;x&quot;).value(POSITION.X), ...\r\n        )))\r\n        .from(POSITIONS)\r\n        .where(POSITIONS.HEAD_ID.eq(HEAD.ID))\r\n      ).as(&quot;positions&quot;)\r\n    )\r\n    .from(HEAD)\r\n    .fetchInto(Head.class);\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore examples are documented here:\r\n\r\n- https://blog.jooq.org/2020/10/09/nesting-collections-with-jooq-3-14s-sql-xml-or-sql-json-support/\r\n- https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-execution/fetching/converter-provider/\r\n\r\nNote that `JSON_ARRAYAGG()` aggregates empty sets into `NULL`, not into an empty `[]`. [If that&#39;s a problem, use `COALESCE()`][4]\r\n\r\n### Using jOOQ 3.15 `MULTISET`\r\n\r\nStarting from jOOQ 3.15, the recommendation is to use `MULTISET`. Your query would now look like this (all type safe!):\r\n\r\n```java\r\ndsl.select(\r\n      HEAD.ID,\r\n      multiset(\r\n        select(POSITION.ID, POSITION.X, ...)\r\n        .from(POSITIONS)\r\n        .where(POSITIONS.HEAD_ID.eq(HEAD.ID))\r\n      ).convertFrom(r -&gt; r.map(Records.mapping(Position::new)))\r\n    )\r\n    .from(HEAD)\r\n    .fetch(Records.mapping(Head::new));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above is assuming you have appropriate constructors on your types [in order to profit from the new ad-hoc converter features][5].\r\n\r\n### Other options\r\n\r\nThere are also a few third parties that help simplify this task of mapping to nested collections, including:\r\n\r\n- [SimpleFlatMapper][6]\r\n- [ModelMapper][7]\r\n\r\nOr, to some extent, you can use jOOQ&#39;s various built-in approaches including the many overloads of [`Result.intoGroups()`][8] or JDK `Collector` based [`ResultQuery.collect()`][9], which is more composable.\r\n\r\nMost of these approaches work to a certain extent only, because they&#39;re all based on de-duplicating flat, denormalised result sets that arise from joining tables. Nesting collections directly in SQL is *much* more powerful for arbitrary target models, so if you get that to work, it&#39;ll work much better.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-building/column-expressions/multiset-value-constructor/\r\n  [2]: https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-building/column-expressions/aggregate-functions/multiset-agg-function/\r\n  [3]: https://blog.jooq.org/jooq-3-15s-new-multiset-operator-will-change-how-you-think-about-sql/\r\n  [4]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/67932476/521799\r\n  [5]: https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-execution/fetching/ad-hoc-converter/\r\n  [6]: https://simpleflatmapper.org/0106-getting-started-jooq.html\r\n  [7]: http://modelmapper.org/user-manual/jooq-integration/\r\n  [8]: https://www.jooq.org/javadoc/latest/org.jooq/org/jooq/Result.html#intoGroups(org.jooq.RecordMapper,org.jooq.RecordMapper)\r\n  [9]: https://www.jooq.org/javadoc/latest/org.jooq/org/jooq/ResultQuery.html#collect(java.util.stream.Collector)","title":"jOOQ - DefaultRecordMapper - List","body":"<h3>The recommended approach of nesting collections</h3>\n<p>The out of the box support for nested collections in jOOQ is via SQL/XML or SQL/JSON, depending on what works best in your SQL dialect.</p>\n<p>Starting with jOOQ 3.14, this was offered as an API, which you can use directly, with jOOQ 3.15, new <a href=\"https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-building/column-expressions/multiset-value-constructor/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>MULTISET</code></a> and <a href=\"https://www.jooq.org/doc/latest/manual/sql-building/column-expressions/aggregate-functions/multiset-agg-function/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>MULTISET_AGG</code></a> functions were added to keep the serialisation formats transparent to your code, and to re-add type safety, <a href=\"https://blog.jooq.org/jooq-3-15s-new-multiset-operator-will-change-how-you-think-about-sql/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see also this blog post</a>.</p>\n<h3>Using jOOQ 3.14 SQL/XML and SQL/JSON directly</h3>\n<p>The idea is that you nest collections directly in SQL, serialise the results as XML or JSON, and use JAXB (for XML), or Gson or Jackson (for JSON) behind the scenes to map the document into a hierarchy of Java classes.

Messages are exchanged, without issue, between this producer and consumer as `jms.topic.` is prefixed to every topic defined on the Spring Boot client. However, when I use an external tool to subscribe to MQTT messages, messages are not received on the topic defined on the tool unless the topic being subscribed to is changed from `server.weatherForecast` to `jms.topic.server.weatherForecast`.\r\n```java\r\nimport org.springframework.jms.annotation.JmsListener;\r\nimport org.springframework.jms.core.JmsTemplate;\r\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Component;\r\n\r\n@Component\r\npublic void samplePC() {\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    private JMSTemplate jmsTemplate;\r\n\r\n    //producer that is called by a cron job\r\n    public void tester() {\r\n        JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject();\r\n        jsonObject.put(&quot;serialNumber&quot;, &quot;105&quot;);\r\n        jmsTemplate.convertAndSend(&quot;server/forecast&quot;, jsonObject.toString().toCharArray());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    //consumer (a message from the producer should be received here, but nothing arrives)\r\n    @JmsListener(destination = &quot;server/forecast&quot;)\r\n    private void consumeWeatherForecastRequest(char[] incomingMessage) {\r\n        //some logic\r\n        jmsTemplate.convertAndSend(&quot;someTopic&quot;, &quot;someMessage&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpon enabling `TRACE` logging for the `RemotingConnectionImpl`, I saw that in the `CreateSessionResponseMessage`, the `serverVersion` attribute had a value of 131, and in the `CreateSessionMessage`, the `version` attribute had a value of 127.\r\n\r\nHow do I ensure that `jms.topic.` is not prefixed to topic names?\r\n\r\nA minimal reproducible example can be downloaded from [this][1] GitHub repository.\r\nI tried to log the prefix in the code, but didn&#39;t find any means of doing so, all the logs simply showed the topic name without the prefix. However, subscribing to the topic being published to from an external client should indicate the prefixing. On subscribing to `topicName` and `jms.topic.topicName`, it will be evident that the message will be delivered to the latter. I&#39;ve noticed that some clients parse the &quot;.&quot; as a &quot;/&quot;, so that could be something else to try in case the &quot;.&quot; doesn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/IsThisABug/ArtemisClient","title":"ActiveMQ Artemis prefixes &quot;jms.topic.&quot; to all topic names defined on Spring Boot Client","body":"<p>I'm using ActiveMQ Artemis 2.18.0 and version 2.5.5 of the <code>spring-boot-starter-artemis</code> dependency on a Spring Boot client.
