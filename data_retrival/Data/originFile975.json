And when you&#39;re certain that all custom types can be *serialized/deserialized* as expected separately, it&#39;s time to check the whole thing.\r\n\r\nThese are the issues I found:\r\n\r\n* `QNode` effectively has two methods annotated with `@JsonAnySetter`: `additionalElements()` and `additionAnswerProperties()` inherited from `BaseNode`. That&#39;s a huge No-No, this annotation is used to handle **all** the unmapped properties which can be found in the input JSON.

And I can count it as being odd number of backslashes if I am ignoring the backslash associated with the unicode escape.

(It is immaterial whether any such backslash arose from an ASCII \\ character in the compiler's raw input or from a Unicode escape \\u005c in the compiler's raw input.) If this number is even, then the ASCII \\ character is eligible to begin a Unicode escape; if the number is odd, then the ASCII \\ character is not eligible to begin a Unicode escape.</p>\n<p>For example, the raw input &quot;<code>\\\\u2122=\\u2122</code>&quot; results in the eleven characters &quot; \\ \\ u 2 1 2 2 = ™ &quot; because while the second ASCII \\ character in the raw input is not eligible to begin a Unicode escape, the third ASCII \\ character is eligible, and \\u2122 is the Unicode encoding of the character ™.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>but in <code>\\\\u2122=\\u2122</code>, in the left side of =, there are 2 backslashes making it eligible to begin a unicode escape, but the right side of =, there's only 1 backslash.\nI understand that this is wrong interpretation because it makes sense that <code>\\\\u2122</code> is wrong. And I can count it as being odd number of backslashes if I am ignoring the backslash associated with the unicode escape.

The only thing I can find with datasource is jta related datasource (refer to the snapshot I pasted here):\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/juQX5.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/juQX5.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, IntelliJ doesn't find the <code>spring.datasource.*</code> config at all. It can only find jta related datasource config. Could anyone tell me what I am missing here? What's the correct config for datasource in spring boot 2.4.5?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","android-studio"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1790714,"reputation":91128,"user_id":1631193,"accept_rate":71,"display_name":"Gabe Sechan"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1665364330,"creation_date":1665364330,"answer_id":74009435,"question_id":74009336,"body_markdown":"The answer is push messaging.

There are a few things that need to be considered:\r\n\r\n1. Something needs to call the `update` method. Ordinarily, this is triggered by a call to `repaint()` on the component, but nothing in this code calls that method.\r\n2. It&#39;s important for an overridden `update` method to call `super.update(g)` to ensure the default behavior is invoked (clearing the canvas and painting it again).\r\n3. Animation has a time component: the oval should move over some period of time. This needs to be incorporated into the logic. AWT has no built-in mechanism for timed behavior.\r\n\r\n   If you&#39;re able to use classes from Swing, the [`javax.swing.Timer`][1] class is very useful for animation.

There is a lot of theory which goes into creating good animation, things like easement, anticipation, squish ... I could go on, but I&#39;m boring myself.\r\n\r\nThe point is, simply incrementing a value (AKA linear progression) is a poor approach to animation.  If the system is slow, busy or for some other reason isn&#39;t keeping up, the animation will suffer because of it (stuttering, pauses, etc).\r\n\r\nA &quot;better&quot; solution is to use a time based progression. That is, you specify the amount of time it will take to move from the current state to it&#39;s new state and then continuously loop and update the state until you run out of time.\r\n\r\n# The &quot;main loop&quot;\r\n\r\nIf you do any research into game development, they always talk about this thing called the &quot;main loop&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe &quot;main loop&quot; is responsible for updating the game state and scheduling paint passes.\r\n\r\nIn terms to your question, you need a &quot;main loop&quot; which can update the position of the oval until it reaches it&#39;s target position.\r\n\r\nBecause most GUI frameworks are already running within their own thread context, you need to setup your &quot;main loop&quot; in another thread\r\n\r\n## AWT\r\n\r\n### Some theory\r\n\r\nAWT is the original GUI framework, so it&#39;s &quot;old&quot;.  While Swing does sit on top of it, you&#39;ll find more people have experience with Swing then they do AWT.\r\n\r\nOne of the important things to keep in mind is, `Canvas` is not double buffered, so, if you&#39;re updating the component fast enough, it will flash.\r\n\r\nTo overcome this, you need to implement some kind of double buffering workflow.\r\n\r\n### Runnable example\r\n\r\n    import

mentioned above, but one of the reasons you might consider using `Canvas` is if you want to take full control over the painting process.  You might do this if you want to create a complex game which and you want to get the best possible performance out of the rendering pipeline.\r\n\r\nSee [BufferStrategy and BufferCapabilities](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/fullscreen/bufferstrategy.html) and the [JavaDocs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/awt/image/BufferStrategy.html) for more detail\r\n\r\n# A Swing based implementation\r\n\r\nHopefully I&#39;ve convinced you that a Swing implementation might be a better solution, which in that case you should make use of a Swing

is hard, I mean, really good animation is hard.  There is a lot of theory which goes into creating good animation, things like easement, anticipation, squish ... I could go on, but I'm boring myself.</p>\n<p>The point is, simply incrementing a value (AKA linear progression) is a poor approach to animation.  If the system is slow, busy or for some other reason isn't keeping up, the animation will suffer because of it (stuttering, pauses, etc).</p>\n<p>A &quot;better&quot; solution is to use a time based progression. That is, you specify the amount of time it will take to move from the current state to it's new state and then continuously loop and update the state until you run out of time.</p>\n<h1>The &quot;main loop&quot;</h1>\n<p>If you do any research into game development, they always talk about this thing called the &quot;main loop&quot;.</p>\n<p>The &quot;main loop&quot; is responsible for updating the game state and scheduling paint passes.</p>\n<p>In terms to your question, you need a &quot;main loop&quot; which can update the position of the oval until it reaches it's target position.</p>\n<p>Because most GUI frameworks are already running within their own thread context, you need to setup your &quot;main loop&quot; in another thread</p>\n<h2>AWT</h2>\n<h3>Some theory</h3>\n<p>AWT is the original GUI framework, so it's &quot;old&quot;.  While Swing does sit on top of it, you'll find more people have experience with Swing then they do AWT.</p>\n<p>One of the important things to keep in mind is, <code>Canvas</code> is not double buffered, so, if you're updating the component fast enough, it will flash.</p>\n<p>To overcome this, you need to implement some kind of double buffering workflow.</p>\n<h3>Runnable example</h3>\n<pre><code>import java.awt.Canvas;\nimport java.awt.Color;\nimport java.awt.Dimension;\nimport java.awt.EventQueue;\nimport java.awt.Frame;\nimport java.awt.Graphics;\nimport java.awt.Graphics2D;\nimport java.awt.image.BufferedImage;\nimport java.time.Duration;\nimport java.time.Instant;\n\npublic class Test {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        new Test();\n    }\n\n    public Test() {\n        EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                Frame frame = new Frame();\n                frame.add(new TestCanvas());\n                frame.pack();\n                frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);\n                frame.setVisible(true);\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    public class Ticker implements Runnable {\n\n        public interface Callbck {\n            public void didTick(Ticker ticker);\n        }\n\n        private boolean isRunning = false;\n        private Thread thread;\n\n        private Callbck callback;\n\n        public void setCallback(Callbck tick) {\n            this.callback = tick;\n        }\n\n        public void start() {\n            if (isRunning) {\n                return;\n            }\n            isRunning = true;\n            thread = new Thread(this);\n            thread.setDaemon(false);\n            thread.start();\n        }\n\n        public void stop() {\n            if (!isRunning) {\n                return;\n            }\n            isRunning = false;\n            thread.interrupt();\n            thread = null;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void run() {\n            while (isRunning) {\n                try {\n                    Thread.sleep(5);\n                    if (callback != null) {\n                        callback.didTick(this);\n                    }\n                } catch (InterruptedException ex) {\n                    isRunning = false;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    public class TestCanvas extends Canvas {\n\n        private BufferedImage buffer;\n\n        int posX;\n\n        private Ticker ticker;\n        private Instant startedAt;\n        private Duration duration = Duration.ofSeconds(5);\n\n        public TestCanvas() {\n            ticker = new Ticker();\n            ticker.setCallback(new Ticker.Callbck() {\n                @Override\n                public void didTick(Ticker ticker) {\n                    if (startedAt == null) {\n                        startedAt = Instant.now();\n                    }\n                    Duration runtime = Duration.between(startedAt, Instant.now());\n                    double progress = runtime.toMillis() / (double)duration.toMillis();\n\n                    if (progress &gt;= 1.0) {\n                        stopAnimation();\n                    }\n\n                    posX = (int)(getWidth() * progress);\n                    repaint();\n                }\n            });\n        }\n\n        protected void startAnimtion() {\n            ticker.start();\n        }\n\n        protected void stopAnimation() {\n            ticker.stop();\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void setBounds(int x, int y, int width, int height) {\n            buffer = new BufferedImage(width, height, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);\n            super.setBounds(x, y, width, height);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public Dimension getPreferredSize() {\n            return new Dimension(200, 200);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void addNotify() {\n            super.addNotify();\n            startAnimtion();\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void removeNotify() {\n            super.removeNotify();\n            buffer = null;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void paint(Graphics g) {\n            super.paint(g);\n            if (buffer == null) {\n                return;\n            }\n            Graphics2D g2d = buffer.createGraphics();\n            g2d.setColor(getBackground());\n            g2d.fillRect(0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight());\n            g2d.setColor(Color.RED);\n            int midY = getHeight() / 2;\n            g2d.fillOval(posX, midY -

OpenJDK is an open-source project owned by Oracle with major involvement from IBM, Apple, Red Hat, and others. Some of those companies contributed their own JDK source code to OpenJDK in order to centralize development of a single joint implementation of the Java specifications. \r\n\r\n - Oracle’s *Oracle OpenJDK* product, available at no cost, is simply a build made straight from the OpenJDK codebase. This product is offered without support.\r\n - Oracle’s commercial Java product, *Oracle Java*, is also largely built from OpenJDK, but Oracle reserves the right to add patches for urgent bug fixes or compatibility tweaks for fast delivery to their paid customers.\r\n\r\nYou can choose and use a JDK product from any of several vendors. All are well-tested, perform similarly, and share the behavior defined by [the Java specifications][2]. \r\n\r\nSome vendors perform additional testing beyond that done at the OpenJDK project, and therefore beyond that done for *Oracle OpenJDK*.
