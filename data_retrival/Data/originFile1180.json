Is there some way to mock a database and its rows so I can allow my filter to take course and validate my filter's functionality?</p>\n<p>Any guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n<p>Thank you\n:)</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","java-stream","collectors","groupingby"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":23959668,"reputation":26587,"user_id":17949945,"display_name":"Alexander Ivanchenko"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"is_accepted":true,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1658057933,"creation_date":1658057575,"answer_id":73011395,"question_id":73011319,"body_markdown":"You were very close.\r\n\r\nSince you need to transform a *stream element* **not** into a single object, but extract a *collection of items* from the *order*, you need a different *collector* - `flatMapping()` instead of `mapping()`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nMap&lt;String, Set&lt;String&gt;&gt; itemsByCustomerName =\r\n    orders.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(\r\n        Order::getCustomerName,\r\n        Collectors.flatMapping(order -&gt; order.getItems().stream().map(Item::getName),\r\n            Collectors.toSet())));\r\n```","title":"Java-Stream - Collect a List of objects into a Set of Strings after applying Collector groupingBy","body":"<p>You were very close.</p>\n<p>Since you need to transform a <em>stream element</em> <strong>not</strong> into a single object, but extract a <em>collection of items</em> from the <em>order</em>, you need a different <em>collector</em> - <code>flatMapping()</code> instead of <code>mapping()</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>Map&lt;String, Set&lt;String&gt;&gt; itemsByCustomerName =\n    orders.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(\n        Order::getCustomerName,\n        Collectors.flatMapping(order -&gt; order.getItems().stream().map(Item::getName),\n            Collectors.toSet())));\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":25623169,"reputation":21,"user_id":19394715,"display_name":"UltraDev"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1658057634,"creation_date":1658057634,"answer_id":73011403,"question_id":73011319,"body_markdown":"`Collectors.groupingBy(Order::getCustomerName, Collectors.toSet())` should work in this case.

Here is an example that starts a process with a modified working directory and environment, and redirects standard output and error to be appended to a log file:</p>\n<pre><code> ProcessBuilder pb =\n   new ProcessBuilder(&quot;myCommand&quot;, &quot;myArg1&quot;, &quot;myArg2&quot;);\n Map&lt;String, String&gt; env = pb.environment();\n env.put(&quot;VAR1&quot;, &quot;myValue&quot;);\n env.remove(&quot;OTHERVAR&quot;);\n env.put(&quot;VAR2&quot;, env.get(&quot;VAR1&quot;) + &quot;suffix&quot;);\n pb.directory(new File(&quot;myDir&quot;));\n File log = new File(&quot;log&quot;);\n pb.redirectErrorStream(true);\n pb.redirectOutput(Redirect.appendTo(log));\n Process p = pb.start();\n assert pb.redirectInput() == Redirect.PIPE;\n assert pb.redirectOutput().file() == log;\n assert p.getInputStream().read() == -1;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you wanna know more about ProcessBuilder, read through the documentation: <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/ProcessBuilder.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Oracle Documentation on Class ProcessBuilder</a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":4291116,"reputation":653,"user_id":3507535,"accept_rate":98,"display_name":"Funereal"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44627,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":6,"accepted_answer_id":23322785,"answer_count":1,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1658074587,"creation_date":1398597683,"question_id":23322740,"body_markdown":"I was thinking if I could send a shell to execute Client-Server ipconfig.

The container keeps the requests isolated and provides basic thread-safety.  No concurrency problems for you there ...  \r\n\r\nThe obvious way to deal with the Python scripts (potentially) running simultaneously is:\r\n\r\n  - create a unique subdirectory for each &quot;grading task&quot;, \r\n  - run the task with a separate `python` command, and \r\n  - use the subdirectory as the command&#39;s current / working directory.\r\n\r\nRefer to the `ProcessBuilder` [javadocs][1] to see how to specify the child processes current directory.\r\n\r\nThen all you need to do is to process the &quot;TEST_GRADING_REPORT&quot; file written to the respective grading task&#39;s current directory when the task has completed.  And then (maybe) clean up.\r\n\r\nNote: I am assuming that the grading script writes the report file into its current directory.  To me, that is implied by your description of the problem.  (If my assumption is incorrect, please update the question to explain *precisely* where the report file is written.)\r\n\r\nThere are potentially other issues that you need to address.  For example:\r\n\r\n  - What happens if the student&#39;s code goes into an infinite loop and the marking script doesn&#39;t complete?

But your question is about Java, so here goes.\r\n\r\nRegarding your use of `ChronoLocalDate`, if you study the Javadoc you’ll see that the abstract classes, interfaces, and superclasses are *not* intended for app development in *java.time*, generally. Those are for internal use by *java.time* itself, and for third parties implementing a chronology for the *java.time* framework. \r\n\r\nTo track a date range as a pair of dates, I suggest adding the [*ThreeTen-Extra*][1] library to your project. That library offers the [`LocalDateRange`][2] class to represent a pair of `LocalDate` objects.

The custom UI element is a rectangle with a symbol in it. Unfortunately, when having creating a second UI element while the first is being animated, the shape of the first custom UI element shapes such that the symbol within the rectangle strangley disappears while the rectangle proceeds to flow from right to left.\r\n\r\nHere you can see two sceenshots that were taken within a short period of time:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I use the code for the XML layout file advised here [Android how to create simple custom UI elements][2].\r\n\r\nNow I use an fragment `Test` with the thread handling class `CountDownTimer` and I create 2 objects from the custom Java class `View_Game_Event_Rectangle` that just stores information for the Custom UI element (but this class is not causing the problem). What I do in the fragment `Test` is to first create the custom UI element (50 timeslots before its predefined starting timeslot) and make the background invisible such that the user can&#39;t see it. Then I shift the custom UI element to the very right (40 timeslots before its predeined starting timeslot). And eventually (when its starting timeslot has come), I animate the view element from right to left on the screen and make the background visible. This works fine. But when the second UI element is created during the animation sequence of the first UI element, the first UI elemment changes its shape (no symbol visible any more within the rectangle) and I don&#39;t understand why this is happening.\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea what I can do to force the two parts of the UI element to be together all the time?\r\n\r\nHere you have the XML layout file of the custom UI element:\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

The custom UI element is a rectangle with a symbol in it. Unfortunately, when having creating a second UI element while the first is being animated, the shape of the first custom UI element shapes such that the symbol within the rectangle strangley disappears while the rectangle proceeds to flow from right to left.</p>\n<p>Here you can see two sceenshots that were taken within a short period of time:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RZbvF.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RZbvF.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>I use the code for the XML layout file advised here <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70643075/android-how-to-create-simple-custom-ui-elements/70643270?noredirect=1#comment128931859_70643270\">Android how to create simple custom UI elements</a>.</p>\n<p>Now I use an fragment <code>Test</code> with the thread handling class <code>CountDownTimer</code> and I create 2 objects from the custom Java class <code>View_Game_Event_Rectangle</code> that just stores information for the Custom UI element (but this class is not causing the problem). What I do in the fragment <code>Test</code> is to first create the custom UI element (50 timeslots before its predefined starting timeslot) and make the background invisible such that the user can't see it. Then I shift the custom UI element to the very right (40 timeslots before its predeined starting timeslot). And eventually (when its starting timeslot has come), I animate the view element from right to left on the screen and make the background visible. This works fine. But when the second UI element is created during the animation sequence of the first UI element, the first UI elemment changes its shape (no symbol visible any more within the rectangle) and I don't understand why this is happening.</p>\n<p>Do you have any idea what I can do to force the two parts of the UI element to be together all the time?</p>\n<p>Here you have the XML layout file of the custom UI element:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;
