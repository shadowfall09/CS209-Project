Here are some relevant quotes:\r\n\r\n&gt; Programmers occasionally overload a method declaration when they mean to override it, leading to subtle problems. The annotation interface Override supports early detection of such problems.\r\n\r\n&gt; If a method declaration in class or interface `Q` is annotated with\r\n&gt; `@Override`, then one of the following three conditions must be true,\r\n&gt; or a compile-time error occurs:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; - the method overrides from `Q` a method declared in a supertype of `Q`\r\n&gt; - the method is override-equivalent to a public method of `Object`\r\n&gt; - `Q` is a record class, and the method is an accessor method for a record component of `Q`\r\n\r\nIt is up to whoever is writing the *compiler* for Java, to implement these rules. The body of the declaration for `@Override` is empty, because it doesn&#39;t need anything in there. It is the *compiler* that does the hard work to follow the above rules. The *compiler* finds where you have used `@Override`, and does a bunch of checks. \r\n\r\nThe declaration itself still needs to be there, because the language specifications mandates it.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that whether a method overrides another is ***not*** determined by the existence of `@Override`. The conditions for overriding is specified in [another section][2] of the language specification. Notably, the list of conditions *does not* include anything about the `@Override` annotation.\r\n\r\nAs said in the quote above, `@Override` is just a way to ensure you don&#39;t write something that you *thought* overrides another method, but in fact doesn&#39;t.\r\n\r\nAt runtime, the JVM finds the correct method to call using its [own rules of overriding][3] that just so happens to closely match the rules of the Java *language*. Whoever is writing an implementation for the JVM has to follow those rules.

The annotation interface Override supports early detection of such problems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a method declaration in class or interface <code>Q</code> is annotated with\n<code>@Override</code>, then one of the following three conditions must be true,\nor a compile-time error occurs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the method overrides from <code>Q</code> a method declared in a supertype of <code>Q</code></li>\n<li>the method is override-equivalent to a public method of <code>Object</code></li>\n<li><code>Q</code> is a record class, and the method is an accessor method for a record component of <code>Q</code></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is up to whoever is writing the <em>compiler</em> for Java, to implement these rules. The body of the declaration for <code>@Override</code> is empty, because it doesn't need anything in there. It is the <em>compiler</em> that does the hard work to follow the above rules. The <em>compiler</em> finds where you have used <code>@Override</code>, and does a bunch of checks.</p>\n<p>The declaration itself still needs to be there, because the language specifications mandates it.</p>\n<p>Also, note that whether a method overrides another is <em><strong>not</strong></em> determined by the existence of <code>@Override</code>. The conditions for overriding is specified in <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.8.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">another section</a> of the language specification. Notably, the list of conditions <em>does not</em> include anything about the <code>@Override</code> annotation.</p>\n<p>As said in the quote above, <code>@Override</code> is just a way to ensure you don't write something that you <em>thought</em> overrides another method, but in fact doesn't.</p>\n<p>At runtime, the JVM finds the correct method to call using its <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se17/html/jvms-5.html#jvms-5.4.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">own rules of overriding</a> that just so happens to closely match the rules of the Java <em>language</em>. Whoever is writing an implementation for the JVM has to follow those rules.

Any help would be appreciated, thank you!</p>\n<p>I tried adding other packages like gremlin-core and gremlin-driver in my gradle dependencies, but none of the imports fixed the issue.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","hibernate","jpa","lazy-loading"],"owner":{"account_id":25845637,"reputation":534,"user_id":19580540,"display_name":"ayush"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1687981352,"creation_date":1687981352,"question_id":76576266,"body_markdown":"I have a scenario of Many to Many relationship with extra attributes-\r\n```\r\n@Data\r\n@NoArgsConstructor\r\n@Setter\r\n@Entity\r\n@Table(name=&quot;policy_county&quot;)\r\npublic class PolicyCounty {\r\n\r\n\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)\r\n    @Column(name=&quot;policy_county_id&quot;)\r\n    private long policyStateId;\r\n\r\n    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\r\n    @JoinColumn(name=&quot;policy_id&quot;)\r\n    private InsurancePolicy policy;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\r\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;county_id&quot;)\r\n    private County county;\r\n\r\n    @Column(name=&quot;cost&quot;,nullable = false)\r\n    private double cost;\r\n\r\n\r\n    public long getPolicyStateId() {\r\n        return policyStateId;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public InsurancePolicy getPolicy() {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Policy County: getPolicy() called&quot;);\r\n        return policy;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public County getCounty() {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Policy county: getCounty() called&quot;);\r\n        return county;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public double getCost() {\r\n        return cost;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Entity\r\n@Table(name = &quot;insurance_policy&quot;)\r\n@Setter\r\n@NoArgsConstructor\r\npublic class InsurancePolicy {\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)\r\n    @Column(name=&quot;policy_id&quot;)\r\n    private long policyId;\r\n\r\n    @Column(name=&quot;policy_name&quot;,nullable = false,unique = true)\r\n    private String policyName;\r\n\r\n    //Short description\r\n    @Column(name=&quot;policy_description&quot;,nullable = false)\r\n    private String policyDescription;\r\n\r\n    //Long description\r\n    @Column(name=&quot;choose_description&quot;,nullable = false)\r\n    private String chooseDescription;\r\n\r\n\r\n    //many policies can belong to one category\r\n    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\r\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;company_id&quot;, nullable = false)\r\n    private Company company;\r\n\r\n    //many policies can belong to one category\r\n    @ManyToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY)\r\n    @JoinColumn(name=&quot;category_id&quot;,nullable=false)\r\n    private Category category;\r\n\r\n    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = &quot;queriedPolices&quot;,fetch = FetchType.LAZY,cascade = {CascadeType.DETACH, CascadeType.MERGE, CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.REFRESH})\r\n    private Set&lt;User&gt;

The entity is a dynamic body with bullet = true and the bullet itself is a kinematic body.\nHere is the code for my contact listener:</p>\n<pre><code>public class CollisionManager implements ContactListener\n{\n\n    @Override\n    public void preSolve(Contact contact, Manifold oldManifold)\n    {\n        Object o1 = contact.getFixtureA().getBody().getUserData();\n        Object o2 = contact.getFixtureB().getBody().getUserData();\n        if (contact.isTouching())\n        {\n            if (o1 instanceof Entity &amp;&amp; o2 instanceof Projectile)\n            {\n                collideBullet((Entity) o1, (Projectile) o2, contact);\n            }\n            else if (o1 instanceof Projectile &amp;&amp; o2 instanceof Entity)\n            {\n                collideBullet((Entity) o2, (Projectile) o1, contact);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n\n    private void collideBullet(Entity entity, Projectile projectile, Contact contact)\n    {\n        if (entity instanceof Enemy &amp;&amp; projectile.getOwner() instanceof Defence)\n        {\n            projectile.setCollided();\n            entity.takeDamage(projectile.getDamage());\n        }\n        else if (entity instanceof Defence &amp;&amp; projectile.getOwner() instanceof Enemy)\n        {\n            projectile.setCollided();\n            entity.takeDamage(projectile.getDamage());\n        }\n        contact.setEnabled(false);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And here is the code for takeDamage in case im an idiot.</p>\n<pre><code>    public void takeDamage(float damage)\n    {\n        this.health -= damage;\n        if (health &lt;= 0)\n        {\n            health = 0;\n            setState(EntityState.DYING);\n            body.setActive(false);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The entities all have one health and the bullets do 10 damage for testing purposes.</p>\n<p>I have tried moving code to presolve instead of beginContact, I have poured through the docs but cannot find what is going wrong, I have tried turning the entity into a bullet, with no changes from that.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","azure","devops","pipeline"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1211967,"reputation":7024,"user_id":1180351,"display_name":"Rob Spoor"},"score":0,"creation_date":1687975094,"post_id":76575223,"comment_id":135013167,"body_markdown":"Where do you checkout the repository?","body":"Where do you checkout the repository?"},{"owner":{"account_id":10362164,"reputation":31,"user_id":11964957,"display_name":"Andrea"},"score":0,"creation_date":1688113576,"post_id":76575223,"comment_id":135033105,"body_markdown":"Ok it worked, thanks!

If it fails to read any characters because the substream has reached the end of the stream, it calls the `close` method of the current substream and begins reading from the next substream.\r\n\r\n&quot;Current substream&quot; is the keyword here.

Aside from the security issues Java serialization is <i>slow</i>."},{"owner":{"account_id":2660877,"reputation":38533,"user_id":2300597,"accept_rate":55,"display_name":"peter.petrov"},"score":0,"creation_date":1687871213,"post_id":76563153,"comment_id":134994967,"body_markdown":"@JustinBertram The Spring version which we are using is 4.3.30","body":"@JustinBertram The Spring version which we are using is 4.3.30"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":11434008,"reputation":30690,"user_id":8381946,"display_name":"Justin Bertram"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1687967831,"creation_date":1687872043,"answer_id":76565327,"question_id":76563153,"body_markdown":"You shouldn&#39;t have any problems.\r\n\r\nAs noted in the [Spring documentation][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt; Instances of the `JmsTemplate` class are *thread-safe once configured*.
