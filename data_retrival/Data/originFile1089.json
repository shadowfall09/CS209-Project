This can be done with a map of 16 entries (or less, if some combinations are invalid and can be mapped to a default). If the string representation is truly a list of strings, one for each possible permission, the solution is even more compact.\r\n\r\nThe key is an object representing the combination of permissions, and the value is the string representation for that combination. You could create a custom type for the key, but in this example, I&#39;m just using four bits of an integer, where each bit indicates whether the permission is granted or not:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate static final int P1 = 1 &lt;&lt; 0, P2 = 1 &lt;&lt; 1, P3 = 1 &lt;&lt; 2, P4 = 1 &lt;&lt; 3;\r\n\r\nprivate static final Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; permissionsToString = Map.ofEntries(\r\n  Map.entry( 0, &quot;No permissions granted.&quot;),\r\n  Map.entry( 1, &quot;Permissions 2-3 revoked.&quot;),\r\n  Map.entry( 2, &quot;Permission 2 granted.&quot;),\r\n  ...\r\n  Map.entry(14, &quot;Permission 1 revoked&quot;),\r\n  Map.entry(15, &quot;Superuser&quot;));\r\n\r\npublic static String toString(boolean p1, boolean p2, boolean p3, boolean p4) {\r\n  int key =   (p1 ? 0 : 1) &lt;&lt; 0\r\n            | (p2 ? 0 : 1) &lt;&lt; 1\r\n            | (p3 ? 0 : 1) &lt;&lt; 2\r\n            | (p4 ? 0 : 1) &lt;&lt; 3;\r\n  return permissionsToString.get(key);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t understand bits, you can use an `EnumSet` or define your own value object to represent the key at a higher level.

I have a setter that in the GraphView which takes ```ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;``` as an argument. Later ```ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;``` is used to draw the graph. I am using Android DataBinding to set data array from activity to my custom graph view. I have defined a ```@BindingAdaptor``` and I have a Model class, which contains the data array for graph. But setting the data array (calling ```setGraphPoints()``` in Activity) does not update the UI. In my case setting a new data array to model does not update the graph. I have used ```notifyPropertyChanged(BR.statModel)``` in my setter method of the Model. But it does nothing. If I called ```activityDataBindings.invalidateAll()``` it updates the GraphView correctly.

I need to pass in a <code>repeated Message myObject</code> object, but how does one pack a repeated protobuf field into an Any?</p>\n<p>I'm writing a Kotlin extension function along the lines of <code>fun List&lt;Message&gt;.toProtobufAny(): com.google.protobuf.Any {...}</code> to (hopefully) make this generic for any Message because I'll be sending in a variety of repeated message types. My first attempts have been to implement an <code>Any.pack(RepeatedFieldBuilder&lt;&gt;)</code>, but haven't been successful yet with the syntax. Not finding very many code example out there on this specific use case.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","android-8.1-oreo","android-go"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1223835,"reputation":75848,"user_id":1189885,"accept_rate":43,"display_name":"chrylis -cautiouslyoptimistic-"},"score":0,"creation_date":1525591001,"post_id":50196665,"comment_id":87411199,"body_markdown":"There&#39;s a full 8.1 build.","body":"There&#39;s a full 8.1 build."},{"owner":{"account_id":170313,"reputation":1244,"user_id":396931,"accept_rate":64,"display_name":"bentzy"},"score":1,"creation_date":1525690862,"post_id":50196665,"comment_id":87442083,"body_markdown":"@chrylis what do you mean?","body":"@chrylis what do you mean?"},{"owner":{"account_id":1223835,"reputation":75848,"user_id":1189885,"accept_rate":43,"display_name":"chrylis -cautiouslyoptimistic-"},"score":0,"creation_date":1525709617,"post_id":50196665,"comment_id":87453796,"body_markdown":"Android 8.1 is already shipping on the Pixel 2.","body":"Android 8.1 is already shipping on the Pixel 2."}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":7809921,"reputation":962,"user_id":5906447,"display_name":"Sahil"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1527183080,"creation_date":1525587811,"answer_id":50196824,"question_id":50196665,"body_markdown":"There doesn&#39;t seems to be direct api for retrieving whether app is running on GO version.\r\n\r\nBut you may cover the case by combination of following :\r\n\r\n - based on device memory and deciding on threshold value for your app:\r\n\r\n        private ActivityManager.MemoryInfo getAvailableMemory() {\r\n         ActivityManager activityManager = \r\n        (ActivityManager) this.getSystemService(ACTIVITY_SERVICE);\r\n        ActivityManager.MemoryInfo memoryInfo = new \r\n        ActivityManager.MemoryInfo();\r\n        activityManager.getMemoryInfo(memoryInfo);\r\n        return memoryInfo;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n - Further similar steps can be take for particular model/manufacturer : \r\n\r\n        String deviceName = android.os.Build.MODEL;\r\n        String deviceMan = android.os.Build.MANUFACTURER;\r\n\r\nHope it helps.","title":"How to detect check or identify app is running on Android Go edition 8.1 Device programatically","body":"<p>There doesn't seems to be direct api for retrieving whether app is running on GO version.</p>\n\n<p>But you may cover the case by combination of following :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>based on device memory and deciding on threshold value for your app:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private ActivityManager.MemoryInfo getAvailableMemory() {\n ActivityManager activityManager = \n(ActivityManager) this.getSystemService(ACTIVITY_SERVICE);\nActivityManager.MemoryInfo memoryInfo = new \nActivityManager.MemoryInfo();\nactivityManager.getMemoryInfo(memoryInfo);\nreturn memoryInfo;\n}\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Further similar steps can be take for particular model/manufacturer : </p>\n\n<pre><code>String deviceName = android.os.Build.MODEL;\nString deviceMan = android.os.Build.MANUFACTURER;\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hope it helps.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":7010076,"reputation":119,"user_id":5373287,"display_name":"TechnoTrancer"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":10,"is_accepted":false,"score":9,"last_activity_date":1553643554,"creation_date":1553643554,"answer_id":55367711,"question_id":50196665,"body_markdown":"This works for me, based on preinstalled Apps.\r\n \r\nIf *Assistant Go* or *Google Go* versions are installed, definitely is an Android Go device.\r\n\r\nIn rare cases that these apps didn&#39;t come preinstalled we look for *Gmail Go* and also *Youtube Go* preinstalled.\r\n\r\nTested on Huawei Y5 Lite with Android 8.1 (Go).\r\n\r\n```java\r\n\r\npublic static boolean isAndroidGoEdition(Context context) {\r\n    final String GMAIL_GO = &quot;com.google.android.gm.lite&quot;;\r\n    final String YOUTUBE_GO = &quot;com.google.android.apps.youtube.mango&quot;;\r\n    final String GOOGLE_GO = &quot;com.google.android.apps.searchlite&quot;;\r\n    final String ASSISTANT_GO = &quot;com.google.android.apps.assistant&quot;;\r\n\r\n    boolean isGmailGoPreInstalled = isPreInstalledApp(context, GMAIL_GO);\r\n    boolean isYoutubeGoPreInstalled = isPreInstalledApp(context, YOUTUBE_GO);\r\n    boolean isGoogleGoPreInstalled = isPreInstalledApp(context, GOOGLE_GO);\r\n    boolean isAssistantGoPreInstalled = isPreInstalledApp(context, ASSISTANT_GO);\r\n\r\n    if(isGoogleGoPreInstalled | isAssistantGoPreInstalled){\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n    if(isGmailGoPreInstalled &amp;&amp;

Deleting the ignite {WORK_DIR}.\r\n2. Deleting the Ingnite server files and reinstalling.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this I no longer saw the Failed to find completed exchange ```future to fetch affinity``` but a very similar error I have seen in the past (see below).  Normally this was fixed by adding the local port to the communication spi bean defenition on my client config, however that is currently there.  \r\n\r\nLocal port config:\r\n``` \r\n&lt;bean id=&quot;communicationSpi&quot; class=&quot;org.apache.ignite.spi.communication.tcp.TcpCommunicationSpi&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;property name=&quot;slowClientQueueLimit&quot; value=&quot;1000&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;property name=&quot;localPort&quot;
