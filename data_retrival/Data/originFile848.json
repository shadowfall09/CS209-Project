And then I exit, as you can see it in the last line.</p>\n\n<p>But sometimes this is what I get:</p>\n\n<pre><code>keyPressed 17\nList of pressed inputs\nctrl\nkeyPressed 79\nList of pressed inputs\nctrl\no\nkeyReleased 17\n2014.10.09, 10:57:34  [INFORMATION]  Open a project ...\n2014.10.09, 10:57:34  [INFORMATION]  Opening file chooser for load.\n2014.10.09, 10:57:35  [INFORMATION]  User clicked 'cancel' in file chooser dialog.\nkeyPressed 17\nList of pressed inputs\nctrl\nkeyReleased 79\n2014.10.09, 10:57:36  [INFORMATION]  Open a project ...\n2014.10.09, 10:57:36  [INFORMATION]  Opening file chooser for load.\n2014.10.09, 10:57:38  [INFORMATION]  User clicked 'cancel' in file chooser dialog.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I get the ctrl and o keyPressed, but I miss one of the keyReleased, the o in this case. Anyway the fileChooser still gets opened. In the next attempt I press again ctrl+o but this time I miss the o keyPressed. I also miss the ctrl keyReleased. Anyway the fileChooser gets still opened.\nBut sometimes it doesnt open, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>keyPressed 17\nList of pressed inputs\nctrl\nkeyPressed 79\nList of pressed inputs\nctrl\no\nkeyReleased 17\n2014.10.09, 11:08:57  [INFORMATION]  Open a project ...\n2014.10.09, 11:08:57  [INFORMATION]  Opening file chooser for load.\n2014.10.09, 11:08:58  [INFORMATION]  User clicked 'cancel' in file chooser dialog.\nkeyPressed 17\nList of pressed inputs\nctrl\nkeyReleased 79\n2014.10.09, 11:08:59  [INFORMATION]  Open a project ...\n2014.10.09, 11:08:59  [INFORMATION]  Opening file chooser for load.\n2014.10.09, 11:09:02  [INFORMATION]  User clicked 'cancel' in file chooser dialog.\nkeyReleased 79\nkeyReleased 17\nkeyReleased 79\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I get ctrl-keyPressed, o-keyPressed, ctrl-keyReleased, no o-keyReleased, fileChooser opens, then I close it.\nI pressed them again, I get ctrl-keyPressed, no o-keyPressed, o-keyReleased, no ctrl-keyReleased, fileChooser opens, then I close it again.\nI press ctrl+o again, I do not get any keyPressed, I just get an o-keyReleased, a ctrl-keyReleased and then another o-keyReleased. FileChooser does not open this time..</p>\n\n<p>Any clue?</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","java","html","local-storage","materialize"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":22581546,"reputation":465,"user_id":16766120,"display_name":"m-naeem66622"},"score":0,"creation_date":1667420332,"post_id":74295018,"comment_id":131165852,"body_markdown":"i had understand what you want to ask....","body":"i had understand what you want to ask...."}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":26780189,"reputation":374,"user_id":20375146,"display_name":"Facundo Gallardo"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1669685058,"creation_date":1667421064,"answer_id":74295323,"question_id":74295018,"body_markdown":"You need to store the favourite cards somewhere, ideally I would say use a Database, but if your project does not have a database yet, the easiest way to do it is to use local storage:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll definitely need to add some javascript in your site.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll let you some links here, and an example:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage#value\r\n\r\n## Example ##\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function onAddButtonClick() {\r\n      // This function will get excecuted whne you click the Add button\r\n      localStorage.setItem(&#39;favouriteCard&#39;, &#39;MockText&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function onFavouriteViewLoad() {\r\n      // You can get this function excecuted when you load the favourite.html page\r\n      // to get what you want to show.\r\n      return localStorage.getItem(&#39;favouriteCard&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;head prefix=&quot;og: http://ogp.me/ns#&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;title&gt;Example&lt;/title&gt;\r\n        &lt;base href=&quot;/&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; type=&quot;image/x-icon&quot; href=&quot;favicon.ico&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;col s12 m6&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;card&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;card-image&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;img src=&quot;images/sample-1.jpg&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;span class=&quot;card-title&quot;&gt;Card Title&lt;/span&gt;\r\n            &lt;button onClick=&quot;onAddButtonClick()&quot; class=&quot;btn-floating halfway-fab waves-effect waves-light red&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;material-icons&quot;&gt;add&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;card-content&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;p&gt;I am a very simple card.

See [Oracle Tutorial][1]. \r\n\r\nWithin your enum definition you can house representations of the values for presentation to the user and for storage in databases or files. This makes a handy one-stop-shop for a programmer to read all about this enum and how it used in your app. \r\n\r\nHere is a complete example. This one class shows what values we use in the user-interface and what values we persist. \r\n\r\n    package com.basilbourque.example;\r\n    \r\n    public enum Status {\r\n        ACTIVE( &quot;Active&quot; , &quot;active&quot; ),\r\n        INACTIVE( &quot;Inactive&quot; , &quot;inactive&quot; ),\r\n        UNKNOWN( &quot;Unknown&quot; , &quot;unknown&quot; );\r\n    \r\n        private String displayName, codeName;\r\n    \r\n        Status ( String displayName , String codeName ) {\r\n            this.displayName = displayName;\r\n            this.codeName = codeName;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public String getDisplayName () { return this.displayName; }  // Or even add a `Locale` argument to support localization.\r\n    \r\n        public String getCodeName () { return this.codeName; }\r\n    \r\n        // To find a `Status` enum object matching input retrieved from a database.\r\n        static public Status ofCodeName ( String codeName ) {\r\n            // Loop each of the enum objects to find a match.\r\n            for ( Status s : Status.values() ) {\r\n                if ( s.getCodeName().equals( codeName ) ) { return s; }\r\n            }\r\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException( &quot;No such Status code name as: &quot; + codeName );\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public String toString() { return &quot;app-status-&quot; + this.getCodeName() ; }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n### Translating persisted values back to enum object\r\n\r\nNotice the static method that can return a `Status` object matching a persisted value retrieved from a database: \r\n\r\n    Status s = Status.ofCodeName( myResultSet.getString( &quot;code&quot; ) ) ;\r\n\r\n### Flexible sets/maps\r\n\r\nIn Java, enums have their own implementation of `Set` and `Map` that are highly optimized both in terms of very little memory used and very fast execution.\r\n\r\n    Set&lt; Status &gt; auditApprovedStatuses = EnumSet.of( Status.ACTIVE , Status.INACTIVE ) ;  \r\n    Set&lt; Status &gt; auditAlertStatuses = EnumSet.of( Status.UNKNOWN ) ;\r\n\r\n    …\r\n\r\n    if( auditAlertStatuses.contains( application.getStatus() ) ) {\r\n        this.alertAuditor( application ) ;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNotice how easy to update these set definitions if your definition of application-status changes.\r\n\r\n### Informative `toString` value\r\n\r\nWhereas a boolean appears as `true` or `false` as a string, in your enum you can override `toString` to generate a much more informative value such as `app-status-inactive`. \r\n\r\nSuch values may be quite useful when logging, tracing, or debugging.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html","title":"Using enum vs Boolean?","body":"<h1>Booleans are rare in business &amp; industry</h1>\n<p>In my experience building custom apps for business, an apparent duality such as &quot;Female/Male&quot; or &quot;On/Off&quot; nearly always evolve or morph into multiple values.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;Female/Male&quot; becomes &quot;Unknown/Female/Male&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;On/Off&quot; becomes &quot;On/WarmingUp/CoolingDown/Off&quot;</li>\n<li>&quot;Incomplete/Completed&quot; becomes &quot;Incomplete/Processing/Completed&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Business rules are often not fully known early-on, or change over time.</p>\n<p>Like many of my colleagues, I learned the hard way to never define such values as booleans.

This makes a handy one-stop-shop for a programmer to read all about this enum and how it used in your app.</p>\n<p>Here is a complete example. This one class shows what values we use in the user-interface and what values we persist.</p>\n<pre><code>package com.basilbourque.example;\n\npublic enum Status {\n    ACTIVE( &quot;Active&quot; , &quot;active&quot; ),\n    INACTIVE( &quot;Inactive&quot; , &quot;inactive&quot; ),\n    UNKNOWN( &quot;Unknown&quot; , &quot;unknown&quot; );\n\n    private String displayName, codeName;\n\n    Status ( String displayName , String codeName ) {\n        this.displayName = displayName;\n        this.codeName = codeName;\n    }\n\n    public String getDisplayName () { return this.displayName; }  // Or even add a `Locale` argument to support localization.\n\n    public String getCodeName () { return this.codeName; }\n\n    // To find a `Status` enum object matching input retrieved from a database.\n    static public Status ofCodeName ( String codeName ) {\n        // Loop each of the enum objects to find a match.\n        for ( Status s : Status.values() ) {\n            if ( s.getCodeName().equals( codeName ) ) { return s; }\n        }\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException( &quot;No such Status code name as: &quot; + codeName );\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() { return &quot;app-status-&quot; + this.getCodeName() ; }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Translating persisted values back to enum object</h3>\n<p>Notice the static method that can return a <code>Status</code> object matching a persisted value retrieved from a database:</p>\n<pre><code>Status s = Status.ofCodeName( myResultSet.getString( &quot;code&quot; ) ) ;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Flexible sets/maps</h3>\n<p>In Java, enums have their own implementation of <code>Set</code> and <code>Map</code> that are highly optimized both in terms of very little memory used and very fast execution.</p>\n<pre><code>Set&lt; Status &gt; auditApprovedStatuses = EnumSet.of( Status.ACTIVE , Status.INACTIVE ) ;  \nSet&lt; Status &gt; auditAlertStatuses = EnumSet.of( Status.UNKNOWN ) ;\n\n…\n\nif( auditAlertStatuses.contains( application.getStatus() ) ) {\n    this.alertAuditor( application ) ;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice how easy to update these set definitions if your definition of application-status changes.</p>\n<h3>Informative <code>toString</code> value</h3>\n<p>Whereas a boolean appears as <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> as a string, in your enum you can override <code>toString</code> to generate a much more informative value such as <code>app-status-inactive</code>.</p>\n<p>Such values may be quite useful when logging, tracing, or debugging.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":8056033,"reputation":2316,"user_id":6073148,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"Zahid Khan"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1607485543,"creation_date":1607458584,"answer_id":65206264,"question_id":4337942,"body_markdown":"I prefer enumerators as I collaborate with remote team comprehending their code and then writing test cases at the dead of night containing boilerplate code I believe use of **`enum` are way and way better** than `boolean` not only it aids in good designs but also reduces cogitative load and increases readability.\r\n\r\n","title":"Using enum vs Boolean?","body":"<p>I prefer enumerators as I collaborate with remote team comprehending their code and then writing test cases at the dead of night containing boilerplate code I believe use of <strong><code>enum</code> are way and way better</strong> than <code>boolean</code> not only it aids in good designs but also reduces cogitative load and increases readability.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":14737423,"reputation":309,"user_id":10643020,"display_name":"Ronald C"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1663889010,"creation_date":1663889010,"answer_id":73821559,"question_id":4337942,"body_markdown":"If it seems arbitrary to choose between `isX`/`hasX` and `isY`/`hasY` for your boolean property, use an enum. \r\n\r\nIn your case a boolean should suffice (preferably `isActive` over `isInactive`).","title":"Using enum vs Boolean?","body":"<p>If it seems arbitrary to choose between <code>isX</code>/<code>hasX</code> and <code>isY</code>/<code>hasY</code> for your boolean property, use an enum.</p>\n<p>In your case a boolean should suffice (preferably <code>isActive</code> over <code>isInactive</code>).</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":60325,"reputation":9034,"user_id":180253,"accept_rate":68,"display_name":"TheJediCowboy"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46539,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":32,"accepted_answer_id":4338016,"answer_count":11,"score":32,"last_activity_date":1669682221,"creation_date":1291311119,"question_id":4337942,"body_markdown":"This may initially seem generic, but in fact, I am actually making the decision on which I need to use.\r\n\r\nWhat I am currently working on involves Employment Applications, those in which will need to be marked at some point &lt;b&gt;Active&lt;/b&gt;
