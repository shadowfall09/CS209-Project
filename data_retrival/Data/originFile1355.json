This would first require you to encapsulate the workflow, for example...</p>\n<pre><code>public class ColorManager {\n    private Color[] masterColors = new Color[] { Color.BLACK, Color.BLUE, Color.CYAN, Color.DARK_GRAY, Color.GRAY, Color.GREEN, Color.LIGHT_GRAY, Color.MAGENTA, Color.ORANGE, Color.PINK, Color.RED, Color.WHITE, Color.YELLOW };\n    private List&lt;Color&gt; randomColors = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(13);\n    \n    public Color next() {\n        if (randomColors.isEmpty()) {\n            randomColors.addAll(Arrays.asList(masterColors));\n            Collections.shuffle(randomColors);\n        }\n        return randomColors.remove(0);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>A shared instance of this then gets passed to each instance of the paddle and ball, which when it detects a collision, it requests the next color, based on conditions of the collision (ie wall or paddle)</p>\n<h1>Feedback...</h1>\n<p>You should not be overriding <code>paint</code> of a top level, especially <code>JFrame</code>, which is a composite component (it contains child components).</p>\n<p>Swing, if used correctly, is double buffered by default, so you don't need the backing buffer at all.</p>\n<p>Instead, you should start with a <code>JPanel</code> and override its <code>paintComponent</code> method and use it as your primary surface.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/painting.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Painting in AWT and Swing</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/painting/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Performing Custom Painting</a> for more details.</p>\n<p><code>KeyListener</code> is a poor choice for monitoring key events in this context, it's notorious for causing, seemingly random, issues.  Make use of the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/keybinding.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Key Bindings API</a> instead.</p>\n<p>Swing is not thread safe (and is single threaded).

Thanks for your time!","title":"Spring Boot not Autowiring on integration tests","body":"<p>I'm currently working on a project using Spring Framework and Spring Boot. I've spent a couple of hours trying to run an integration test for saving data to the database, but every time I try it fails. It seems Autowiring is not working for one of the dependencies I need. I'm trying to save a client to my database, and I need to store certain information about where to store a certificate/key pair. That info is obtained from another table that stores the current storage politics. I load it in prepareClient (that method does other things, but are irrelevant. Please ignore generateNss, generateName and generateLastName too, just dummy methods to get fake information).</p>\n<p>Here's my integration test:</p>\n<pre><code>@SpringBootTest\n@Slf4j\npublic class ClientTest {\n    @Autowired\n    private ClientOperations clientRepo;\n    @Autowired\n    private StorageConfiguration storageConfiguration;\n\n    @Test\n    public void saveClient() {\n        int[] numbers = getNumbers();\n        for(int i=0; i&lt;numbers.length; i++) {\n            String name = &quot;&quot;;\n            String lastName = &quot;&quot;;\n            name = generateName();\n            lastName = generateLastName();\n            String nss = generateNss();\n            Client client = new Client();\n            client.setNss(nss);\n            client.setName(name);\n            client.setLastName(lastName);\n            client = prepareClient(client);\n            ResponseData rd = clientRepo.saveClient(((long) numbers[i]), client);\n            rd.print();\n        }\n    }\n\nprivate Client prepareClient(Client client) {\n //More stuff goes in here...\n\n        boolean isCertificateCloudStored = storageConfiguration.isCertificateCloudStored();\n        boolean isKeyCloudStored = storageConfiguration.isKeyCloudStored();\n        client.isCertificateCloudStored(isCertificateCloudStored);\n        client.isKeyCloudStored(!isKeyCloudStored);\n        return client;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>My main function:</p>\n<pre><code>@SpringBootApplication\n@EnableJpaRepositories\npublic class ClientsMicroserviceApplication {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SpringApplication.run(ClientsMicroserviceApplication.class, args);\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the exception:</p>\n<pre><code>java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke &quot;com.sat.com.sat.downloaderservice.StorageConfiguration.isCertificateCloudStored()&quot; because &quot;this.storageConfiguration&quot; is null\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, this is only happening when trying to test. I've run the application an performed a couple of succesful inserts via HTTP Post on a Controller with Postman. Those request use the same logic I'm testing, including reading storageConfiguration, so it's not an issue on the implementation of the class. And bad luck, I've got a huge bunch of rules to test and there's no way I can do that if I don't do most of them with code.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

One with duplicates only and one with duplicate numbers removed.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p><code>Original array: 3 9 1 3 5 5 7 3</code></p>\n<p><code>Array with no duplicates: 3 9 1 5 7 3</code></p>\n<p><code>Array containing the numbers removed from original array: 3 5</code></p>\n<p>Here is my program so far:</p>\n<pre><code>        ArrayList &lt;Integer&gt; OgArr = new ArrayList &lt;Integer&gt;();\n    \n    Random random = new Random();\n    \n    int n = 35;\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)\n    {\n        Integer r = 1 + random.nextInt(25);\n        OgArr.add(r);\n    }\n    \n    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; copyOfArr = (ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;) OgArr.clone();\n    \n    int i = 0;\n    int leng = copyOfArr.size();\n    \n    for (i = 0; i &lt; leng - 1; i++) {\n        int imin = i;\n        for (int j = i + 1; j &lt; leng; j++) {\n            if (copyOfArr.get(j) &lt; copyOfArr.get(imin)) {\n                imin = j;\n            }\n        }\n        Collections.swap(copyOfArr,i,imin);      \n    }\n    //System.out.println(copyOfArr);\n    int z = 0;\n    \n    int[] ogArray = new int[copyOfArr.size()];\n    \n    for (z = 0; z &lt; copyOfArr.size(); z++){\n        ogArray[z] = copyOfArr.get(z);\n    }\n    \n    int a = 0;\n    int b = 0;\n    \n    for(a = 0; a &lt; ogArray.length; a++){ // PRIMARILY TROUBLED AREA\n        int counter = 0;\n        int temp = ogArray[a];\n        for(b = 1; b &lt; ogArray.length; b++){\n            if(temp == ogArray[b]){\n                count++\n            }\n        }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This program above creates an arraylist, populates it with 1-25 being the params, and makes a copy and converts it to an array.</p>\n<p>My issue comes down to comparing different indicies of the array to check for duplicates. Following that, also storing them in two seperate arrays.</p>\n<p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","codenameone"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":394396,"reputation":52134,"user_id":756809,"accept_rate":89,"display_name":"Shai Almog"},"score":1,"creation_date":1652243317,"post_id":72188660,"comment_id":127556307,"body_markdown":"Couple of things: `startEditingAsync` is wrong.

However, that should not matter.\r\n\r\nYou don&#39;t need to get the month from the date picker to accomplish what you actually want to do.\r\n\r\nThe *default* implementation of the date picker will gray out the days which are not in the current month.\r\n\r\nHowever, from your screenshot, the days not in the current month are not grayed out for your implementation.  So your implementation has done something to break the default.\r\n\r\nThe issue is in the code you don&#39;t supply.  Probably the CSS.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\nYou can see that the cells not in this month have gray backgrounds.\r\n\r\nYou have to look closely, it is a pretty subtle effect . . .\r\n\r\n[![date picker][2]][2]\r\n\r\n    import javafx.application.Application;\r\n    import javafx.geometry.Insets;\r\n    import javafx.scene.Scene;\r\n    import javafx.scene.control.DatePicker;\r\n    import javafx.stage.Stage;\r\n    \r\n    import java.time.LocalDate;\r\n    \r\n    public class DatePickApp extends Application {\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {\r\n            DatePicker picker = new DatePicker(LocalDate.now());\r\n            picker.setPadding(new Insets(10));\r\n    \r\n            stage.setScene(new Scene(picker));\r\n            stage.show();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            launch(args);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo, how does the default graying of these cells occur?\r\n\r\nAs noted by kleopatra in comments, \r\n\r\n&gt; those off cells already have styles next-month/previous-month ...\r\n&gt; setting rules for the next/previous month indeed does work - but: unfortunately they are undocumented\r\n\r\nYou can find default styles in `modena.css`.  There is some risk in using or replacing styles that are not documented (the styling may not continue to work when the JavaFX library is upgraded).  However, if you want a custom look for your JavaFX app of any non-trivial size, then you will need to make use of customizing undocumented styles anyway.  \r\n\r\nA reasonable approach is to limit the use of undocumented styles and package your app with a JavaFX version you tested, but still, when necessary, perform styling using the undocumented properties to get the look you need.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say for instance the default gray is a bit too subtle and you want to change it, you can look in modena.css to see how the styling is done and override it in your custom stylesheet.\r\n\r\nDefault styling occurs via:\r\n\r\n    .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .previous-month,\r\n    .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .next-month {\r\n        -fx-background: derive(-fx-control-inner-background, -4%);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo just a 4% decrease in brightness for the grayed-out cell backgrounds.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s override this with a different color, `mistyrose`.\r\n\r\n[![mistyrose][3]][3]\r\n\r\n    public class DatePickApp extends Application {\r\n    \r\n        public static final String CSS = &quot;data:text/css,&quot; + // language=CSS\r\n                &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n                .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .previous-month,\r\n                .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .next-month {\r\n                    -fx-background: mistyrose;\r\n                }\r\n                &quot;&quot;&quot;;\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {\r\n            DatePicker picker = new DatePicker(LocalDate.now());\r\n            picker.setPadding(new Insets(10));\r\n    \r\n            Scene scene = new Scene(picker);\r\n            scene.getStylesheets().add(CSS);\r\n    \r\n            stage.setScene(scene);\r\n            stage.show();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            launch(args);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow it is much clearer which days are not in the current month.\r\n\r\nBut we have introduced a problem.  Now if you hover over those cells, they don&#39;t highlight like they used to.  \r\n\r\nThis is because the CSS rules for the more complex controls such as TableView and DatePicker are complex and easy to break.  \r\n\r\nSo, once you start defining custom rules for some states of the controls, you have to define or redefine the rules for other states of the controls with similar style classes.  For example, to fix the highlighting issue, redeclare the hover psuedo-state rule for those cells to remap it to the default.  \r\n\r\nOh, and by the way, there are different styles for if you selected the day in the previous month than changed the month.  So you need to remap those as well.  It can get really complex and easy to make errors once you start doing this.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish all of this you need to really study the [JavaFX CSS reference guide][4], CSS standards in general and, especially the `modena.css` stylesheet inside your JavaFX distribution (search for it in your IDE).  Copy and paste and modify from the default modena.css stylesheet to customize it.  Make use of the looked up color names from modena, know how to override them and how to use the color derivation functions.\r\n\r\nSo here is a more sophisticated color remap (it still may have issues with certain states, I didn&#39;t thoroughly test it).\r\n\r\nIn the example, I have hovered over July 7th and you can see, it is a darker grey to indicate it is not selectable because it is not in the current month of June.\r\n\r\n[![july][5]][5]\r\n\r\n    public class DatePickApp extends Application {\r\n    \r\n        public static final String CSS = &quot;data:text/css,&quot; + // language=CSS\r\n                &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n                .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .previous-month,\r\n                .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .next-month {\r\n                    -fx-background: mistyrose;\r\n                }\r\n                .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .previous-month.selected,\r\n                .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .next-month.selected {\r\n                    -fx-background: -fx-selection-bar;\r\n                }\r\n                .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .previous-month:hover,\r\n                .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .next-month:hover {\r\n                    -fx-background: -fx-selection-bar-non-focused;\r\n                }\r\n                .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .previous-month.today,\r\n                .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .next-month.today {\r\n                    -fx-background-color: mistyrose, derive(-fx-selection-bar-non-focused, -20%25), mistyrose;\r\n                }\r\n                .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .previous-month.today:hover,\r\n                .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .next-month.today:hover {\r\n                    -fx-background-color: -fx-selection-bar-non-focused, derive(-fx-selection-bar-non-focused, -20%25), -fx-selection-bar-non-focused;\r\n                }\r\n                &quot;&quot;&quot;;\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {\r\n            DatePicker picker = new DatePicker(LocalDate.now());\r\n            picker.setPadding(new Insets(10));\r\n    \r\n            Scene scene = new Scene(picker);\r\n            scene.getStylesheets().add(CSS);\r\n    \r\n            stage.setScene(scene);\r\n            stage.show();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            launch(args);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe weird `-20%25` is because I am using a data URL so I need to encode the `%` symbol in the data URL.  If you use a standard CSS file, you can just write `-20%`.\r\n\r\n&gt;  I wanted to change it to light blue to match my application scheme.\r\n\r\nYou can do this by setting `-fx-base` for the entire application or individual controls or portions of the scene graph.\r\n\r\nHere is an example.  The base color is `lightskyblue`.\r\n\r\n[![lightblue][6]][6]\r\n\r\nWhat is done here is to remove the custom style sheet altogether and set the base color which is used to derive the colors of many things.  \r\n\r\nSo this is an easy way to consistently color your UI for a theme without overriding too much of the detailed styling rules.

However, that should not matter.</p>\n<p>You don't need to get the month from the date picker to accomplish what you actually want to do.</p>\n<p>The <em>default</em> implementation of the date picker will gray out the days which are not in the current month.</p>\n<p>However, from your screenshot, the days not in the current month are not grayed out for your implementation.  So your implementation has done something to break the default.</p>\n<p>The issue is in the code you don't supply.  Probably the CSS.</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<p>You can see that the cells not in this month have gray backgrounds.</p>\n<p>You have to look closely, it is a pretty subtle effect . . .</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/At0Wm.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/At0Wm.png\" alt=\"date picker\" /></a></p>\n<pre><code>import javafx.application.Application;\nimport javafx.geometry.Insets;\nimport javafx.scene.Scene;\nimport javafx.scene.control.DatePicker;\nimport javafx.stage.Stage;\n\nimport java.time.LocalDate;\n\npublic class DatePickApp extends Application {\n\n    @Override\n    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {\n        DatePicker picker = new DatePicker(LocalDate.now());\n        picker.setPadding(new Insets(10));\n\n        stage.setScene(new Scene(picker));\n        stage.show();\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        launch(args);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, how does the default graying of these cells occur?</p>\n<p>As noted by kleopatra in comments,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>those off cells already have styles next-month/previous-month ...\nsetting rules for the next/previous month indeed does work - but: unfortunately they are undocumented</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can find default styles in <code>modena.css</code>.  There is some risk in using or replacing styles that are not documented (the styling may not continue to work when the JavaFX library is upgraded).  However, if you want a custom look for your JavaFX app of any non-trivial size, then you will need to make use of customizing undocumented styles anyway.</p>\n<p>A reasonable approach is to limit the use of undocumented styles and package your app with a JavaFX version you tested, but still, when necessary, perform styling using the undocumented properties to get the look you need.</p>\n<p>Let's say for instance the default gray is a bit too subtle and you want to change it, you can look in modena.css to see how the styling is done and override it in your custom stylesheet.</p>\n<p>Default styling occurs via:</p>\n<pre><code>.date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .previous-month,\n.date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .next-month {\n    -fx-background: derive(-fx-control-inner-background, -4%);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So just a 4% decrease in brightness for the grayed-out cell backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Let's override this with a different color, <code>mistyrose</code>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2IPem.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2IPem.png\" alt=\"mistyrose\" /></a></p>\n<pre><code>public class DatePickApp extends Application {\n\n    public static final String CSS = &quot;data:text/css,&quot; + // language=CSS\n            &quot;&quot;&quot;\n            .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .previous-month,\n            .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .next-month {\n                -fx-background: mistyrose;\n            }\n            &quot;&quot;&quot;;\n\n    @Override\n    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {\n        DatePicker picker = new DatePicker(LocalDate.now());\n        picker.setPadding(new Insets(10));\n\n        Scene scene = new Scene(picker);\n        scene.getStylesheets().add(CSS);\n\n        stage.setScene(scene);\n        stage.show();\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        launch(args);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now it is much clearer which days are not in the current month.</p>\n<p>But we have introduced a problem.  Now if you hover over those cells, they don't highlight like they used to.</p>\n<p>This is because the CSS rules for the more complex controls such as TableView and DatePicker are complex and easy to break.</p>\n<p>So, once you start defining custom rules for some states of the controls, you have to define or redefine the rules for other states of the controls with similar style classes.  For example, to fix the highlighting issue, redeclare the hover psuedo-state rule for those cells to remap it to the default.</p>\n<p>Oh, and by the way, there are different styles for if you selected the day in the previous month than changed the month.  So you need to remap those as well.  It can get really complex and easy to make errors once you start doing this.</p>\n<p>To accomplish all of this you need to really study the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JavaFX CSS reference guide</a>, CSS standards in general and, especially the <code>modena.css</code> stylesheet inside your JavaFX distribution (search for it in your IDE).  Copy and paste and modify from the default modena.css stylesheet to customize it.  Make use of the looked up color names from modena, know how to override them and how to use the color derivation functions.</p>\n<p>So here is a more sophisticated color remap (it still may have issues with certain states, I didn't thoroughly test it).</p>\n<p>In the example, I have hovered over July 7th and you can see, it is a darker grey to indicate it is not selectable because it is not in the current month of June.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tGcSp.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tGcSp.png\" alt=\"july\" /></a></p>\n<pre><code>public class DatePickApp extends Application {\n\n    public static final String CSS = &quot;data:text/css,&quot; + // language=CSS\n            &quot;&quot;&quot;\n            .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .previous-month,\n            .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .next-month {\n                -fx-background: mistyrose;\n            }\n            .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .previous-month.selected,\n            .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .next-month.selected {\n                -fx-background: -fx-selection-bar;\n            }\n            .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .previous-month:hover,\n            .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .next-month:hover {\n                -fx-background: -fx-selection-bar-non-focused;\n            }\n            .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .previous-month.today,\n            .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .next-month.today {\n                -fx-background-color: mistyrose, derive(-fx-selection-bar-non-focused, -20%25), mistyrose;\n            }\n            .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .previous-month.today:hover,\n            .date-picker-popup &gt; * &gt; .next-month.today:hover {\n                -fx-background-color: -fx-selection-bar-non-focused, derive(-fx-selection-bar-non-focused, -20%25), -fx-selection-bar-non-focused;\n            }\n            &quot;&quot;&quot;;\n\n    @Override\n    public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {\n        DatePicker picker = new DatePicker(LocalDate.now());\n        picker.setPadding(new Insets(10));\n\n        Scene scene = new Scene(picker);\n        scene.getStylesheets().add(CSS);\n\n        stage.setScene(scene);\n        stage.show();\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        launch(args);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The weird <code>-20%25</code> is because I am using a data URL so I need to encode the <code>%</code> symbol in the data URL.

Save the application instance to a static variable in the application `init` method.\r\n 2. Provide a static accessor method to access it.\r\n\r\nThis is kind of like a singleton pattern, but the application instance is created by the `launch` method.\r\n\r\n    public class AccessibleApp extends Application {\r\n        private static AccessibleApp applicationInstance;\r\n\r\n        public static AccessibleApp getApplicationInstance() {\r\n            return applicationInstance;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void init() {\r\n            applicationInstance = this;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // other app functionality ...\r\n\r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            launch(args);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen the application can be accessed from any class using:\r\n\r\n    AccessibleApp.getApplicationInstance()\r\n\r\n**Issues with your sample code and approach**\r\n\r\n 1. You should not create another application instance. \r\n\r\n    The [application lifecycle][1] javadoc notes there should be only one application instance in the JVM and this will be created by the invocation of the `launch()` method.\r\n\r\n    The `launch()` method can only be called once for the JVM process.\r\n\r\n 2. There should never be an `@FXML` annotation in an Application class. \r\n\r\n    `@FXML` is only used in a controller and the application class should not also be a controller.\r\n\r\n 3. Your overall approach is incorrect:\r\n\r\n    &gt; in HelloController I want to listen to button clicks which then execute methods inside the HelloApplcation \r\n\r\n    You should not do this. \r\n\r\n    The application class is responsible for the application lifecycle. Unless it is a trivial self-contained hello world style application, it should not be doing anything else. It definitely should not be servicing fxml controller callbacks. \r\n\r\n**Recommended Approach**\r\n\r\nPerform your application logic either directly in the controller or in a dedicated service class.\r\n\r\n 1. Write a Counter class that has an integer property for the counter value and a timeline. \r\n 2. Provide start and stop methods on the class, do not use a string status for that. \r\n 3. In the controller create a Counter instance and start and stop it on user interaction. \r\n 4. In the controller initialize method, [bind the display field text](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34546433/javafx-binding-a-textproperty-eg-label-to-a-simple-integer) to the counter value.\r\n\r\nRather than trying to debug and fix your current code, I recommend you work on implementing the suggested approach instead.\r\n\r\nTo understand such approaches more, see:\r\n\r\n * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32342864/applying-mvc-with-javafx\r\n * [How to apply MVC in JavaFX](https://edencoding.com/mvc-in-javafx/)\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://openjfx.io/javadoc/17/javafx.graphics/javafx/application/Application.html","title":"JavaFX How can I access Application object in Controller?","body":"<p><strong>How can I access the Application object in Controller?</strong></p>\n<p>To directly answer your question.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Save the application instance to a static variable in the application <code>init</code> method.</li>\n<li>Provide a static accessor method to access it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is kind of like a singleton pattern, but the application instance is created by the <code>launch</code> method.</p>\n<pre><code>public class AccessibleApp extends Application {\n    private static AccessibleApp applicationInstance;\n\n    public static AccessibleApp getApplicationInstance() {\n        return applicationInstance;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void init() {\n        applicationInstance = this;\n    }\n\n    // other app functionality ...\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        launch(args);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then the application can be accessed from any class using:</p>\n<pre><code>AccessibleApp.getApplicationInstance()\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Issues with your sample code and approach</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>You should not create another application instance.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://openjfx.io/javadoc/17/javafx.graphics/javafx/application/Application.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">application lifecycle</a> javadoc notes there should be only one application instance in the JVM and this will be created by the invocation of the <code>launch()</code> method.</p>\n<p>The <code>launch()</code> method can only be called once for the JVM process.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>There should never be an <code>@FXML</code> annotation in an Application class.</p>\n<p><code>@FXML</code> is only used in a controller and the application class should not also be a controller.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Your overall approach is incorrect:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>in HelloController I want to listen to button clicks which then execute methods inside the HelloApplcation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You should not do this.</p>\n<p>The application class is responsible for the application lifecycle.

Let&#39;s explore why.\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Unknown type - &amp;lt?&amp;gt&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nA question mark in angle brackets `&lt;?&gt;` is called the **unknown type**. For the compiler, that means that the *actual type* can&#39;t be predicted and at runtime it could appear to be pretty match anything: an `Object`, a `String`, a `Cat`. Therefore, everything that you retrieve from the **unbounded collection** will be treated as an `Object`:\r\n```\r\nCollection&lt;?&gt; items = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\nObject item = items.iterator().next(); // this assignment is safe and will compile\r\n```\r\nBut *don&#39;t confuse* an *unbounded collection* `Collection&lt;?&gt;` with a *collection of objects* `Collection&lt;Object&gt;`. They are ***incompatible***. \r\n\r\n`Collection&lt;Object&gt;` has **invariant behavior**, i.e. it expects only another *collection* of type `Object` to be assigned to it. Meanwhile, we can assign a collection of ***any*** type to `Collection&lt;?&gt;`.\r\n```\r\nCollection&lt;?&gt; items = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();         // OK\r\n\r\nCollection&lt;Object&gt; objects1 = items;                   // that will not compile\r\nCollection&lt;Object&gt; objects2 = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); // that will not compile\r\nCollection&lt;Object&gt; objects3 = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;(); // OK - compiler will not complain here\r\n```\r\nSo, **unknown type** could be represented by anything that **extends** `Object`. And you might think about `Collection&lt;?&gt;` as if it is a [**upper-bounded**](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/upperBounded.html) collection `Collection&lt;? extends Object&gt;`. They are absolutely ***compatible***.\r\n```\r\nCollection&lt;?&gt; items = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\nCollection&lt;? extends Object&gt; upperBounded = items; // no issues\r\nitems = upperBounded;                              // no issues\r\n```\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Modifying an unbounded collection&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nWild-cards like `&lt;?&gt; `or `&lt;? extends Object&gt;` are ***not actual types***. They are just a way to tell the compiler that we don&#39;t know what the *type* will be at runtime.\r\n\r\nThen what will be the *actual type* of `Collection&lt;?&gt;` ?\r\n\r\nSince it&#39;s already clear that *unknown type* (`&lt;?&gt;`) implies that it could be *any type* that extends `Object`, hence under the hood of a `Collection&lt;?&gt;` could appear an `ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;`, an `ArrayList&lt;String&gt;`, a `HashSet&lt;BigDecimal&gt;`, etc. \r\n\r\n***Remainder***: parameterized collection that will appear in the guise of `Collection&lt;?&gt;` at runtime is **invariant**, which means that `ArrayList&lt;String&gt;` is expected to contain only `String`s and  `HashSet&lt;BigDecimal&gt;` is expected to store only instances of `BigDecimal`.

Let's explore why.</p>\n<h3>Unknown type - &lt?&gt</h3>\n<p>A question mark in angle brackets <code>&lt;?&gt;</code> is called the <strong>unknown type</strong>. For the compiler, that means that the <em>actual type</em> can't be predicted and at runtime it could appear to be pretty match anything: an <code>Object</code>, a <code>String</code>, a <code>Cat</code>. Therefore, everything that you retrieve from the <strong>unbounded collection</strong> will be treated as an <code>Object</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>Collection&lt;?&gt; items = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\nObject item = items.iterator().next(); // this assignment is safe and will compile\n</code></pre>\n<p>But <em>don't confuse</em> an <em>unbounded collection</em> <code>Collection&lt;?&gt;</code> with a <em>collection of objects</em> <code>Collection&lt;Object&gt;</code>. They are <em><strong>incompatible</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><code>Collection&lt;Object&gt;</code> has <strong>invariant behavior</strong>, i.e. it expects only another <em>collection</em> of type <code>Object</code> to be assigned to it. Meanwhile, we can assign a collection of <em><strong>any</strong></em> type to <code>Collection&lt;?&gt;</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>Collection&lt;?&gt; items = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();         // OK\n\nCollection&lt;Object&gt; objects1 = items;                   // that will not compile\nCollection&lt;Object&gt; objects2 = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); // that will not compile\nCollection&lt;Object&gt; objects3 = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;(); // OK - compiler will not complain here\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, <strong>unknown type</strong> could be represented by anything that <strong>extends</strong> <code>Object</code>. And you might think about <code>Collection&lt;?&gt;</code> as if it is a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/upperBounded.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>upper-bounded</strong></a> collection <code>Collection&lt;? extends Object&gt;</code>. They are absolutely <em><strong>compatible</strong></em>.</p>\n<pre><code>Collection&lt;?&gt; items = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\nCollection&lt;? extends Object&gt; upperBounded = items; // no issues\nitems = upperBounded;                              // no issues\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Modifying an unbounded collection</h3>\n<p>Wild-cards like <code>&lt;?&gt; </code>or <code>&lt;? extends Object&gt;</code> are <em><strong>not actual types</strong></em>. They are just a way to tell the compiler that we don't know what the <em>type</em> will be at runtime.</p>\n<p>Then what will be the <em>actual type</em> of <code>Collection&lt;?&gt;</code> ?</p>\n<p>Since it's already clear that <em>unknown type</em> (<code>&lt;?&gt;</code>) implies that it could be <em>any type</em> that extends <code>Object</code>, hence under the hood of a <code>Collection&lt;?&gt;</code> could appear an <code>ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;</code>, an <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code>, a <code>HashSet&lt;BigDecimal&gt;</code>, etc.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Remainder</strong></em>: parameterized collection that will appear in the guise of <code>Collection&lt;?&gt;</code> at runtime is <strong>invariant</strong>, which means that <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code> is expected to contain only <code>String</code>s and  <code>HashSet&lt;BigDecimal&gt;</code> is expected to store only instances of <code>BigDecimal</code>.
