In such environments, applications must be capable of executing on a variety of hardware architectures. Within this variety of hardware platforms, applications must execute atop a variety of operating systems and interoperate with multiple programming language interfaces. To accommodate the diversity of operating environments, the Java Compiler TM product generates bytecodes--an architecture neutral intermediate format designed to transport code efficiently to multiple hardware and software platforms. The interpreted nature of Java technology solves both the binary distribution problem and the version problem; the same Java programming language byte codes will run on any platform.\n&gt;\n&gt;    Architecture neutrality is just one part of a truly portable system. Java technology takes portability a stage further by being strict in its definition of the basic language. Java technology puts a stake in the ground and specifies the sizes of its basic data types and the behavior of its arithmetic operators.

In such environments, applications must be capable of executing on a variety of hardware architectures. Within this variety of hardware platforms, applications must execute atop a variety of operating systems and interoperate with multiple programming language interfaces. To accommodate the diversity of operating environments, the Java Compiler TM product generates bytecodes--an architecture neutral intermediate format designed to transport code efficiently to multiple hardware and software platforms. The interpreted nature of Java technology solves both the binary distribution problem and the version problem; the same Java programming language byte codes will run on any platform.</p>\n<p>Architecture neutrality is just one part of a truly portable system. Java technology takes portability a stage further by being strict in its definition of the basic language. Java technology puts a stake in the ground and specifies the sizes of its basic data types and the behavior of its arithmetic operators. Your programs are the same on every platform--there are no data type incompatibilities across hardware and software architectures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>1.2.5 Interpreted, Threaded, and Dynamic</strong></p>\n<p>The Java interpreter can execute Java bytecodes directly on any machine to which the interpreter and run-time system have been ported.

My research has also revealed that O(logn) + O(n) != O(nlogn) but rather just O(n).</p>\n<p>My questions are: Is my conclusion correct regarding the two notations I found? If so, would this be a O(n) time complexity and why is it O(n) if there is a O(log2n)? If conclusion is not correct, where did I go wrong? Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","spring-boot","spring-data-jpa"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2563377,"reputation":7174,"user_id":2224047,"display_name":"Nikolai  Shevchenko"},"score":0,"creation_date":1662095699,"post_id":73578023,"comment_id":129931094,"body_markdown":"Take a look at tracing frameworks like Spring Cloud Sleuth (https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-sleuth)","body":"Take a look at tracing frameworks like Spring Cloud Sleuth (<a href=\"https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-sleuth\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-sleuth</a>)"},{"owner":{"display_name":"user11868214"},"score":0,"creation_date":1662095977,"post_id":73578023,"comment_id":129931122,"body_markdown":"I suspect it may be slightly difficult since your aspect intercepts calls to the service.

config.properties file and load the properties to be used as part of the build.</p>\n\n<p>Then, as an example, the jar plugin will use that property as part of its configuration (the

The JVM Specification does not mention them and indeed java.exe does absolutely nothing whatsoever. No type checking. No class file verification. At all.\r\n\r\nHence: Entirely a compile time thing. `javac` knows what they are, and uses it to [A] generate errors or warnings telling you that some type situation you have declared is not guaranteed to actually be true, and [B] generate a whole bunch of syntax sugar for you - inject casts where needed, for example.\r\n\r\nSo, what does it do?\r\n\r\n__It links things__.\r\n\r\nGenerics is a way to tell the compiler that 2+ occurrences of a type are the same.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say you want a simple method that prints its argument to a debug log, and then returns its argument. A basic take would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static Object log(Object o) {\r\n  log.debug(o.toString());\r\n  return o;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this method is not as useful as you might imagine. For example, you may want to do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nString username = log(getWebParam(&quot;username&quot;)).toLowerCase();\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this would not work: You can&#39;t calls `.toLowerCase()` on an object, and the signature of your `log` method says it returns `Object`. It does not say it returns &#39;the same type&#39; or even the same value, that&#39;s only known if you inspect the body of the method, and maybe in a future version you change that stuff (changing signatures is &#39;backwards incompatible&#39;, changing body is not).\r\n\r\nSo let&#39;s use this linking ability. Let&#39;s link the parameter type and the return type:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static &lt;T&gt; T log(T o) {\r\n  log.debug(o.toString());\r\n  return o;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code produces __entirely identical class files__ - this is compiled to a method with signature `log(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;` - that&#39;s classfile-ese for `Object log(Object v)`. The T stuff is gone. However, when you __call__ `log`, javac _does_ know and see those generics, it knows the types are &#39;linked&#39; and will therefore __silently inject a cast to make it work__. In other words, with the new `T`-ified generics in place, this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nString username = log(getWebParam(&quot;username&quot;)).toLowerCase();\r\n```\r\n\r\nStill ends up being compiled to an invocation to a method that returns Object, and thus, does not seem like it should compile. But it will, because if you inspect the class file with e.g. `javap -c -v`, you&#39;ll notice a TYPECAST bytecode which is weird because this line has no cast in it.

It&#39;s a comment to tell javac that you know what you are doing and it should just compile it, even though it has no idea if it&#39;ll be true. Generally, you want to avoid doing it (as you&#39;ll need to pinky swear that you&#39;ve read through and fully understood the code and you think it cannot possibly _not_ be a T), and `javac` always emits a warning to tell you that this doesn&#39;t actually do anything.\r\n* Given an instance of, say, a `List&lt;String&gt;`, determining that the thing in the `&lt;&gt;` is &#39;String&#39; is __impossible__, because, erased: At runtime, generics do not exist.\r\n* Yes, generics is basically really fancy compiler-checked __documentation__. This is awesome, but, just be aware of this.\r\n* At runtime, generics do not exist as far as `java.exe` is concerned, and java does not allow 2 identical methods (same name, same param types, same return type). Hence, `void foo(List&lt;Integer&gt; x) {} void foo(List&lt;Double&gt; y) {}` __does not compile__ - as far as the runtime is concerned, those are 2 identical methods.\r\n","title":"What is the difference between assigning a raw type to a patamaterized type reference and vice versa?","body":"<p>Generics are a figment of the compiler's imagination; any usage of generics (anything in the <code>&lt;&gt;</code>) is either <strong>erased</strong> by the compiler (is no longer present in the <code>.class</code> file), or, if it is still present (only generics in signatures remains), the runtime (<code>java.exe</code>) thinks they are comments - the runtime just skips over them as it does not know what they are. The JVM Specification does not mention them and indeed java.exe does absolutely nothing whatsoever. No type checking. No class file verification. At all.</p>\n<p>Hence: Entirely a compile time thing. <code>javac</code> knows what they are, and uses it to [A] generate errors or warnings telling you that some type situation you have declared is not guaranteed to actually be true, and [B] generate a whole bunch of syntax sugar for you - inject casts where needed, for example.</p>\n<p>So, what does it do?</p>\n<p><strong>It links things</strong>.</p>\n<p>Generics is a way to tell the compiler that 2+ occurrences of a type are the same.</p>\n<p>Let's say you want a simple method that prints its argument to a debug log, and then returns its argument. A basic take would be:</p>\n<pre><code>public static Object log(Object o) {\n  log.debug(o.toString());\n  return o;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unfortunately, this method is not as useful as you might imagine. For example, you may want to do:</p>\n<pre><code>String username = log(getWebParam(&quot;username&quot;)).toLowerCase();\n</code></pre>\n<p>But this would not work: You can't calls <code>.toLowerCase()</code> on an object, and the signature of your <code>log</code> method says it returns <code>Object</code>. It does not say it returns 'the same type' or even the same value, that's only known if you inspect the body of the method, and maybe in a future version you change that stuff (changing signatures is 'backwards incompatible', changing body is not).</p>\n<p>So let's use this linking ability. Let's link the parameter type and the return type:</p>\n<pre><code>public static &lt;T&gt; T log(T o) {\n  log.debug(o.toString());\n  return o;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code produces <strong>entirely identical class files</strong> - this is compiled to a method with signature <code>log(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;</code> - that's classfile-ese for <code>Object log(Object v)</code>. The T stuff is gone. However, when you <strong>call</strong> <code>log</code>, javac <em>does</em> know and see those generics, it knows the types are 'linked' and will therefore <strong>silently inject a cast to make it work</strong>. In other words, with the new <code>T</code>-ified generics in place, this:</p>\n<pre><code>String username = log(getWebParam(&quot;username&quot;)).toLowerCase();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Still ends up being compiled to an invocation to a method that returns Object, and thus, does not seem like it should compile. But it will, because if you inspect the class file with e.g. <code>javap -c -v</code>, you'll notice a TYPECAST bytecode which is weird because this line has no cast in it. That's because javac injects one - it casts the value returned by <code>log</code> to <code>String</code> (That is, it injects bytecode that will throw a <code>ClassCastException</code> if somehow it is not).</p>\n<p>The crucial realization here is that it's all the compiler just figuring out what you probably meant.

So instead of:</p>\n\n<pre><code>java &lt;whatever&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Use</p>\n\n<pre><code>c:\\&lt;full path to correct JRE&gt;\\bin\\java.exe &lt;whatever&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>3) If your PATH is correct and files are there and it's still failing, the path could be getting truncated because it is too long.  see: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6036462/running-java-gives-error-could-not-open-c-program-files-java-jre6-lib-amd64\">Running Java gives &quot;Error: could not open `C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre6\\lib\\amd64\\jvm.cfg&#39;&quot;</a> .</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3809190,"reputation":1,"user_id":3160678,"display_name":"S Chinmayi"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1388851233,"creation_date":1388851233,"answer_id":20923216,"question_id":9051103,"body_markdown":" In our system, for &quot;java(jre)&quot; for runtime purpose is availed, So If you install any different version of java, propbably the version before the one which is already installed.\r\n\r\nE.g.; my windows 8.1 I have runtime java version of 8, then when I install Ver7 it is bu default taking V8, yet I uninstall 8, In this kind of Scenarios, Removing java.exe from c:\\windows\\system32 makes my java runtime work\r\n                                                               ","title":"Java path..Error of jvm.cfg","body":"<p>In our system, for \"java(jre)\" for runtime purpose is availed, So If you install any different version of java, propbably the version before the one which is already installed.</p>\n\n<p>E.g.; my windows 8.1 I have runtime java version of 8, then when I install Ver7 it is bu default taking V8, yet I uninstall 8, In this kind of Scenarios, Removing java.exe from c:\\windows\\system32 makes my java runtime work</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3741904,"reputation":2009,"user_id":3128652,"display_name":"Vaibhav Jain"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":7,"is_accepted":false,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1436203698,"creation_date":1391420758,"answer_id":21523980,"question_id":9051103,"body_markdown":"You can not Uninstall/Reinstall JRE if you are having this error. \r\nThat&#39;s why because previous installation has copied 3 files namely Java.exe, Javaw.exe, javaws.exe in the c:/windows/system32 folder.\r\nSimply go there and remove these files and download a fresh version of jre from oracle and install it.

As the main developer of my company&#39;s Swing GUI app, JIDE has made my life both easier and harder.\r\n\r\nFirst, the **good** part.\r\n\r\nThe ***breadth and depth*** of its components are incredible. Their lastest demo has 171 items, and most are for different components. It&#39;s what Swing should&#39;ve been. The company is indeed small, but you can&#39;t possibly say they have only &quot;one product&quot; (re @Stephen C). You&#39;re not gonna find any other component suite that has everything from date chooser and popup alert, to searchable and filterable list and table, to pivot table and docking.\r\n\r\nTheir ***support*** is surreal. It&#39;s true (per @Carlos) that the only medium is the [forum][1], but the turn-around time and quality of their responses are truly amazing (I&#39;m the 3rd top poster there, so I do know). Many of my posts are new feature and API change (e.g. private -&gt; protected) requests, and they fulfill the vast majority of them within one release or two (which means a few weeks to a month at most).\r\n\r\nYou can buy ***source code license*** for full source code and unobfuscated debug jars. I&#39;d strongly suggest that you do (I wish I could get sales commission from them) if you plan to use their more complicated products like pivot and docking.\r\n\r\nOnce you have their source code, you can do a lot of customization if you need to, as the code is very open and nicely structured for ***extension***. Sometimes it&#39;s risky to extend undocumented classes/methods, but they&#39;ve kept their code very steady.\r\n\r\nAnd I have to say that their ***code quality*** is top notch. It&#39;s not squeaky clean (it&#39;s as big as Swing itself), but I&#39;ve never been forced to scratch my head and wonder WTF.\r\n\r\nThey have very solid [developer guide][2](scroll down the page) for each product group. [javadoc][3] is excellent. The [full demo][4] itself is a great way to explore the components and features. ***Documentation*** was the main reason why I picked JIDE docking over FlexDock (and later I found JIDE docking also has a lot more features).\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the **difficult** part.\r\n\r\nAs @Carlos mentioned, they do introduce ***regressions*** with each release. It doesn&#39;t seem like they have totally comprehensive and fully automated regression tests, but that&#39;s probably next to impossible given the complexity and interactive nature of their products, especially for things like pivot and docking. Even though they fix things very fast, it&#39;s always a pain having to wait and then upgrade to a new version, only to find other regressions. That being said, my company&#39;s GUI app has shipped several versions without major issues.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve mainly used many of their somewhat standalone components like date chooser, balloon tip, status bar, multi-page dialog, etc., and two of their most complicated products: pivot table and docking. (Sorry, no JDAF.)\r\n\r\nThey are complicated for good reasons. OLAP is an industry of its own, and docking is the underpinning of all modern IDEs. That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t call this section &quot;the bad part&quot;. Pivot and docking are difficult to use not because of their quality but due to their ***complexity***.\r\n\r\nFor example, JIDE docking manager has over 70 primitive bean properties (as of 2.9.5). Some are interdependent, and it takes a while to figure out how to set them for your particular needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nAll in all, I would recommend JIDE without any reservation.

You can&#39;t ignore the returns.\r\n\r\nI rewrote your code to not use `List&lt;T&gt;` and you should in general never iterate over a list in reactive java. Instead you should place your list into a `Flux` so that it produces items from the list. I do that with `Flux#fromIterable`.\r\n\r\nA `list` is of finite length, while a `Flux` can be of infinite length. It will just produce items for us as long as it contains items.

If you can, use `flatMap` over `map` for efficiency but when using `flatMap` order is not guaranteed.\r\n\r\nI then save each item, but i have no idea what your DAO returns, so by using `thenReturn` i basically ignore what `saveFoo` returns and tell it to return my dto instead.\r\n\r\nThen i collect all to a list and we can return this list to the calling client.\r\n\r\n","title":"Spring Webflux Wait for all Flux&lt;T&gt; Before Returning Response","body":"<p>Okey, first of all, when you call a reactive endpoint, what the framework will do is to call all your operators in the opposite direction, upstream until it finds a producer.</p>\n<p>A producer is something that can produce items for us, for instance a <code>Mono&lt;T&gt;</code> or a <code>Flux&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>This is called the <em>assembly phase</em> and if you break this chain when it is calling everything in reverse order, you are what we call breaking <code>the reactive chain</code>.</p>\n<p>When the chain is broken it will result in that the framework can't find a producer, which in turn means that it can't produce items.</p>\n<p>You have probably heard of the term <code>nothing happens until you subscribe</code> but this also infers that the chain is intact between the subscriber, and the producer.</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;Foo&gt; buf = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n    foos.forEach(f -&gt; {\n        \n        // here is a return, you are not handling\n        fooDao.createFoo(l)\n            .doOnNext(buf::add)\n            .next()\n            .subscribe();\n    });\n\n    return buf;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The comment in the above code states where you are breaking the chain.</p>\n<p>you are getting <code>foos</code> and you <code>iterate</code> through the items in <code>foos</code>.

Its sort of a queue instead of a list.</p>\n<pre><code>public Mono&lt;List&lt;DTO&gt;&gt; addFoos() {\n    return getData()\n        .flatMap(dataHolder -&gt; {\n            return Flux.fromIterable(dataHolder.getResults())\n                        .flatMap(data -&gt; Mono.just(new DTO(data.getFoo())))\n                        .flatMap(dto -&gt; save(dto).thenReturn(dto))\n                        .collectList();\n         };\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here you can see that i extract the list, place it into a Flux and then from the Flux i continue the chain. If you can, use <code>flatMap</code> over <code>map</code> for efficiency but when using <code>flatMap</code> order is not guaranteed.</p>\n<p>I then save each item, but i have no idea what your DAO returns, so by using <code>thenReturn</code> i basically ignore what <code>saveFoo</code> returns and tell it to return my dto instead.</p>\n<p>Then i collect all to a list and we can return this list to the calling client.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":6922345,"reputation":1256,"user_id":5314546,"display_name":"Adam Bickford"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1662085351,"creation_date":1662085351,"answer_id":73577196,"question_id":73571745,"body_markdown":"If you need the responses from the pending `Publisher` there is `.zip()`:\r\n\r\n     Mono&lt;String&gt; withValues = Mono.zip(expensiveCall(&quot;foo&quot;), expensiveCall(&quot;bar&quot;))\r\n            .map(tuple -&gt; &quot;%s -&gt; %s&quot;.formatted(tuple.getT1(), tuple.getT2()))\r\n            //we need both values for the downstream call\r\n            .flatMap(this::expensiveCall)\r\n            .thenReturn(&quot;Have a nice day!&quot;);\r\nIf you don&#39;t care what the values are, just that the calls have asynchronously completed, you can use `.when()`:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    Mono&lt;String&gt; withoutValues = Mono.when(expensiveCall(&quot;foo&quot;), expensiveCall(&quot;bar&quot;))\r\n                //we don&#39;t care what he values are, just a signal the work is done\r\n                .then(expensiveCall(&quot;baz&quot;))\r\n                .thenReturn(&quot;Have a nice day!&quot;);","title":"Spring Webflux Wait for all Flux&lt;T&gt; Before Returning Response","body":"<p>If you need the responses from the pending <code>Publisher</code> there is <code>.zip()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code> Mono&lt;String&gt; withValues = Mono.zip(expensiveCall(&quot;foo&quot;), expensiveCall(&quot;bar&quot;))\n        .map(tuple -&gt; &quot;%s -&gt; %s&quot;.formatted(tuple.getT1(), tuple.getT2()))\n        //we need both values for the downstream call\n        .flatMap(this::expensiveCall)\n        .thenReturn(&quot;Have a nice day!&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you don't care what the values are, just that the calls have asynchronously completed, you can use <code>.when()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>Mono&lt;String&gt; withoutValues = Mono.when(expensiveCall(&quot;foo&quot;), expensiveCall(&quot;bar&quot;))\n            //we don't care what he values are, just a signal the work is done\n            .then(expensiveCall(&quot;baz&quot;))\n            .thenReturn(&quot;Have a nice day!&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1449578,"reputation":3098,"user_id":1366913,"accept_rate":91,"display_name":"nathansizemore"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":4861,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":73575697,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1662085351,"creation_date":1662045255,"question_id":73571745,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m working with Spring Webflux + R2DBC to insert some data into a database.\r\n\r\nCall for data -&gt; Put in database -&gt; Return data. \r\n\r\nController\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n@RestController\r\npublic class UtilController {\r\n  private final FooService service;\r\n\r\n  @Autowired\r\n  public UtilController(FooService service) { this.service = service; }\r\n\r\n  @GetMapping(path = &quot;/load-data&quot;)\r\n  public Mono&lt;List&lt;Foo&gt;&gt; loadFoos() { return service.addFoos(); }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nService\r\n\r\n``` java\r\npublic Mono&lt;List&lt;Foo&gt;&gt; addFoos() {\r\n  return webClient.getSomeStuff()\r\n      .map(results -&gt; results.stream()\r\n          .map(/* ...transform to domain model */)\r\n          .toList())\r\n      .map(foos -&gt; {\r\n        // This is the problem site.\r\n        List&lt;Foo&gt; buf = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n        foos.forEach(f -&gt; {\r\n          fooDao.createFoo(l)\r\n              .doOnNext(buf::add)\r\n              .next()\r\n              .subscribe();\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        return buf;\r\n      });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDAO\r\n\r\n``` java\r\npublic Flux&lt;Foo&gt; createFoo(final Foo foo) {\r\n  var query = &quot;&lt;INSERT_STUFF_STATEMENT&gt;&quot;;\r\n\r\n  // &quot;publisher&quot; is private final Publisher&lt;? extends Connection&gt; publisher;\r\n  var connection = Mono.from(publisher);\r\n  return connection.flatMapMany(c -&gt; c.createStatement(query)\r\n      .bind(&quot;STUFF&quot;, foo.getStuff())\r\n      .execute())\r\n      .map(result -&gt; Foo.builder()\r\n          .stuff(whatever)\r\n          .build());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main problem is I can&#39;t figure out how to make it wait for all the results to be returned and added to the eventual `List&lt;Foo&gt;` to return back to the controller.

it is worth to mention that the term [*combinations*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination) isn&#39;t applicable here.\r\n\r\n&gt; **Combination** is a selection of items from a set that has distinct\r\n&gt; members\r\n\r\nAnd *permutations* represent different ways of arranging elements of a *combination*.\r\n\r\nThe key point, is that *combination* is selection done on a single source of data. Meanwhile, we have multiple Sets.\r\n\r\nAnd if you pay attention to the result, which sample data provided in the question is expected to give, you&#39;ll find out that all these &quot;combinations&quot; consist of exactly the same elements `1,2,3,4,5` (*because you&#39;ve used only these numbers in all the sets*), but combinations can&#39;t be comprised of completely identical elements.\r\n\r\nThe sequences that need to be generated are rather similar to [*Cartesian product*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product), with one caveat: we need to discard some of them because of uniqueness requirement. So this term might not be suitable either.
