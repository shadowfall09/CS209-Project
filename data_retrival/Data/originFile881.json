The proxy will pick an instance out of the pool and invoke the method on it. Since you don&#39;t have a CDI scope on `BookmarkEndpoint`, I believe it will be re-created every request (don&#39;t quote me on that, use the debugger).

Collecting to single collection essentially introduces performance bottleneck and overhead in case of concurrent execution. It is possible to estimate the relative cost of overhead by replacing </p>\n\n<pre><code>collecting to collection -&gt; counting the element count\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For streams it can be done by <code>collect(Collectors.counting())</code>. I got results:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Collections: Elapsed time:   41856183 ns    (0.041856 seconds)\nStreams: Elapsed time:       546590322 ns   (0.546590 seconds)\nParallel streams: Elapsed time:  1540051478 ns  (1.540051 seconds)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That' s for a big task! (<code>int max = 10000000</code>) <strong>Conclusion:</strong> collecting items to collection took majority of time. The slowest part is adding to list. BTW, simple <code>ArrayList</code> is used for <code>Collectors.toList()</code>.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":326925,"reputation":14868,"user_id":648955,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"leventov"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":226,"is_accepted":false,"score":225,"last_activity_date":1579663889,"creation_date":1395859686,"answer_id":22670380,"question_id":22658322,"body_markdown":"1.

QUESTION : First of all, where should the .so files exist in my device after installing the APK ? \r\n\r\n* Starting From **Android M**, it supports **uncompressed native librarie**s in APKs, which allows the platform to read the native libraries **directly from the APK** without having to extract them.It have the flag **android:extractNativeLibs** which is default **false**. This is why you don&#39;t see them in the **&quot;data/data/packagename/lib/&quot;** directory if you&#39;re testing on a device on Android M or later.\r\n\r\n* Ultimately for testing purpose you can use **android:extractNativeLibs=&quot;true**&quot; in Application tag of AndroidManifest.xml, to see in &quot;data/data/packagename/lib/&quot; folder. \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n           &lt;application\r\n        \tandroid:extractNativeLibs=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\r\n        \t  ...\r\n           &lt;/application&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n2.

Perhaps I am misunderstanding something though, regarding of where the shared library files go after installing an APK.\r\n\r\nSetup: Android, using a build.gradle file, and CMakeLists.txt since I want to run some C++ code using JNI. I followed the tutorial basically from https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code, along with other pieces here and there from other websites. \r\n\r\nMy C++ code works correctly (it only returns a number). The APK generated can be unzipped, and I see all the .so files under the lib directory. Inside /lib there are four directories, each one for a different arquitecture, including my target (ARM). However, when I install the APK and try to run my C++ code portion, it returns an unsatisfiedlinkerror with the message saying &quot;We looked for your .so file on nativeDirs under /system/lib and /vendor/lib, but we didn&#39;t find it).&quot;\r\n\r\nNow, if I instead push the .so file from the unzipped APK, into the location they mention, everything will run correctly (so at least my code is compiled correctly). Am I misunderstanding something? I was also reading that it appears that the .so files are not extracted from the APK anymore, but still, it&#39;s not finding it.
