If this is _not_ homework, use that one. If it is, it&#39;s a bit odd to ask SO to &#39;do your homework&#39; for you.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind a circular array is that they __do not__ start at `0`, so your `for (int x = 0` loop is incorrect. They start at `head` and they end at `tail`, with the caveat that when you loop through it, the &#39;index&#39; increment operation isn&#39;t `i++` but `i = (i + 1) % size`, i.e. if your backing store (`A1` here) is 100 large, head is 98, and tail is 5, to loop through the whole thing in sequence, the indices you want to hit are:\r\n\r\n* 98, 99, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\r\n\r\n```java\r\nint idx = head;\r\n\r\nwhile (idx != tail) {\r\n  Object item = A1[idx];\r\n  // do stuff with `item` here\r\n  idx = (idx + 1) % A1.length;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nKey point here is the `%` operator. It is __crucial__ for circular implementations of any sort. If you don&#39;t recognize it, scroll to the end of this answer.\r\n\r\nThis assumes `head` is inclusive and `tail` is exclusive. If it isn&#39;t, change your code so that it works that way, the math is a ton easier, and doing ranges like `[1, 2)` so (start is inclusive, end is exclusive) is idiomatic java.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s your loop. Get rid of the `for` loop.\r\n\r\nThere are many more smaller problems with this code:\r\n\r\n### Superfluous data\r\n\r\nThe size of your ArrayDeque is `(length + tail - head) % length`. There is no need to store it separately, and it significantly complicates matters by storing it separately. What if you fail to update `size` in accordance, for example? There&#39;s a ton more to test. Just don&#39;t do that. Similarly, the total length of the backing store is simply `A1.length`, there is no need to separately store this, it just introduces opportunity for things to fall out of sync. Get rid of the `volume` field entirely.\r\n\r\n## Failure to adhere to java standards\r\n\r\nVariable names are `writtenLikeThis`, so the right name is `a1`, not `A1`. Also, names should be descriptive; tha thing should be called `data` or `store`, not `A1`.\r\n\r\nShouldn&#39;t that method simply be called `toString()`? If not, at least it should be called `turnToString`, not `turntoString`.\r\n\r\nYour `S` variable in `turntoString` should be called `s`.\r\n\r\n## Bad string concatenation\r\n\r\n`x += y` where x and y are strings is very expensive. You do it in the loop. It&#39;s got `O(n^2)` performance behaviour because of this. Use a StringBuilder instead. So instead of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nString x = &quot;&quot;;\r\nfor (String item : list) x += item;\r\nreturn x;\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou do:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nStringBuilder x = new StringBuilder();\r\nfor (String item : list) x.append(item);\r\nreturn x.toString();\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## What&#39;s `%`?\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s the modulo operator. In basis `a % b` means: Divide a by b, but toss the result in the garbage; what we care about is the _remainder_. 7 divided by 2 is 3 (toss that in the garbage, we don&#39;t care), with a remainder of 1 (ah, that&#39;s what we care about).\r\n\r\nHowever, that&#39;s generally not the right way to think about it. What `%` does is make math circular. Stick `% X` at the end of anything and it&#39;s basically saying: &quot;... but do the operation on a number line that loops right back around at X&quot;. Hence why its so crucial for circular operations. It&#39;s an easy way to &#39;solve&#39; the problem. For example, in a deque with volume 100, if I want to go: &quot;What element is 50 to the right of the 80th element&quot;, in basis it&#39;s just 80+50, except that gives you 130 which is &#39;past&#39; the range of your arraydeque. You want 30 instead. `%100` will do that: 130%100 __is__ 30.\r\n\r\nOne weird thing about `%` is that it doesn&#39;t fix signs. `-30%100` is -30, not 30. This can be fixed by adding 100 to it all. `(-30+100)%100` is 70. This is what you want: Imagine I ask: We&#39;re at index 5. Now go 35 to the left. `5-35` is -30, but what we really want is store[70]. In general in &#39;circular math world&#39; adding the total size of the loop is a no-op. If you have a circle of size 100 and ask &#39;go 100 elements to the right&#39;, that&#39;s just walking around the circle and does nothing. Hence you can always just add that to any index lookups.\r\n","title":"How can I convert my circular array into a String?","body":"<p>It's a very bad idea to name your class <code>ArrayDeque</code>, given that java's built in library already has such a beast.

They start at <code>head</code> and they end at <code>tail</code>, with the caveat that when you loop through it, the 'index' increment operation isn't <code>i++</code> but <code>i = (i + 1) % size</code>, i.e. if your backing store (<code>A1</code> here) is 100 large, head is 98, and tail is 5, to loop through the whole thing in sequence, the indices you want to hit are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>98, 99, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4</li>\n</ul>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>int idx = head;\n\nwhile (idx != tail) {\n  Object item = A1[idx];\n  // do stuff with `item` here\n  idx = (idx + 1) % A1.length;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Key point here is the <code>%</code> operator. It is <strong>crucial</strong> for circular implementations of any sort. If you don't recognize it, scroll to the end of this answer.</p>\n<p>This assumes <code>head</code> is inclusive and <code>tail</code> is exclusive. If it isn't, change your code so that it works that way, the math is a ton easier, and doing ranges like <code>[1, 2)</code> so (start is inclusive, end is exclusive) is idiomatic java.</p>\n<p>That's your loop. Get rid of the <code>for</code> loop.</p>\n<p>There are many more smaller problems with this code:</p>\n<h3>Superfluous data</h3>\n<p>The size of your ArrayDeque is <code>(length + tail - head) % length</code>. There is no need to store it separately, and it significantly complicates matters by storing it separately. What if you fail to update <code>size</code> in accordance, for example? There's a ton more to test. Just don't do that. Similarly, the total length of the backing store is simply <code>A1.length</code>, there is no need to separately store this, it just introduces opportunity for things to fall out of sync. Get rid of the <code>volume</code> field entirely.</p>\n<h2>Failure to adhere to java standards</h2>\n<p>Variable names are <code>writtenLikeThis</code>, so the right name is <code>a1</code>, not <code>A1</code>. Also, names should be descriptive; tha thing should be called <code>data</code> or <code>store</code>, not <code>A1</code>.</p>\n<p>Shouldn't that method simply be called <code>toString()</code>? If not, at least it should be called <code>turnToString</code>, not <code>turntoString</code>.</p>\n<p>Your <code>S</code> variable in <code>turntoString</code> should be called <code>s</code>.</p>\n<h2>Bad string concatenation</h2>\n<p><code>x += y</code> where x and y are strings is very expensive. You do it in the loop. It's got <code>O(n^2)</code> performance behaviour because of this. Use a StringBuilder instead. So instead of:</p>\n<pre><code>String x = &quot;&quot;;\nfor (String item : list) x += item;\nreturn x;\n</code></pre>\n<p>you do:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>StringBuilder x = new StringBuilder();\nfor (String item : list) x.append(item);\nreturn x.toString();\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<h2>What's <code>%</code>?</h2>\n<p>It's the modulo operator. In basis <code>a % b</code> means: Divide a by b, but toss the result in the garbage; what we care about is the <em>remainder</em>. 7 divided by 2 is 3 (toss that in the garbage, we don't care), with a remainder of 1 (ah, that's what we care about).</p>\n<p>However, that's generally not the right way to think about it. What <code>%</code> does is make math circular. Stick <code>% X</code> at the end of anything and it's basically saying: &quot;... but do the operation on a number line that loops right back around at X&quot;. Hence why its so crucial for circular operations. It's an easy way to 'solve' the problem. For example, in a deque with volume 100, if I want to go: &quot;What element is 50 to the right of the 80th element&quot;, in basis it's just 80+50, except that gives you 130 which is 'past' the range of your arraydeque. You want 30 instead. <code>%100</code> will do that: 130%100 <strong>is</strong> 30.</p>\n<p>One weird thing about <code>%</code> is that it doesn't fix signs. <code>-30%100</code> is -30, not 30. This can be fixed by adding 100 to it all. <code>(-30+100)%100</code> is 70. This is what you want: Imagine I ask: We're at index 5. Now go 35 to the left. <code>5-35</code> is -30, but what we really want is store[70]. In general in 'circular math world' adding the total size of the loop is a no-op. If you have a circle of size 100 and ask 'go 100 elements to the right', that's just walking around the circle and does nothing. Hence you can always just add that to any index lookups.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"display_name":"user18984687"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":89,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":73975915,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1665068113,"creation_date":1665067392,"question_id":73975733,"body_markdown":"I have a class `ArrayDeque` where I take in a circular array and I&#39;m trying to implement a function `turntoString()` to turn my Array into a string.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m currently stumped on how can I do this due to the fact that this is a circular array.

Manage Upstream Dependencies</h3>\n<p>Or you can update the library that causes the problem:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;plugin&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;org.sonatype.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;nexus-staging-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;1.6.8&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;extensions&gt;true&lt;/extensions&gt;\n  &lt;configuration&gt;\n    &lt;serverId&gt;ossrh&lt;/serverId&gt;\n    &lt;nexusUrl&gt;https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/&lt;/nexusUrl&gt;\n    &lt;autoReleaseAfterClose&gt;true&lt;/autoReleaseAfterClose&gt;\n  &lt;/configuration&gt;\n  &lt;dependencies&gt;\n    &lt;dependency&gt;\n      &lt;groupId&gt;com.thoughtworks.xstream&lt;/groupId&gt;\n      &lt;artifactId&gt;xstream&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n      &lt;version&gt;1.4.15&lt;/version&gt; &lt;!-- apparently this needs to be exactly this version --&gt;\n    &lt;/dependency&gt;\n  &lt;/dependencies&gt;\n&lt;/plugin&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4982023,"reputation":162,"user_id":13327121,"display_name":"Shailesh Mishra"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1665064605,"creation_date":1665064605,"answer_id":73975097,"question_id":70153962,"body_markdown":"There are some broken internal dependencies in the library\r\n\r\nUpdating nexus-staging-maven-plugin to 1.6.13 will solve your problem:\r\n\r\n     &lt;groupId&gt;org.sonatype.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n     &lt;artifactId&gt;nexus-staging-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n     &lt;version&gt;1.6.13&lt;/version&gt;","title":"nexus-staging-maven-plugin: maven deploy failed: An API incompatibility was encountered while executing","body":"<p>There are some broken internal dependencies in the library</p>\n<p>Updating nexus-staging-maven-plugin to 1.6.13 will solve your problem:</p>\n<pre><code> &lt;groupId&gt;org.sonatype.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\n &lt;artifactId&gt;nexus-staging-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n &lt;version&gt;1.6.13&lt;/version&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":21731,"reputation":9045,"user_id":53069,"accept_rate":77,"display_name":"sproketboy"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":5417,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":11,"accepted_answer_id":70157413,"answer_count":2,"score":11,"last_activity_date":1665064605,"creation_date":1638185775,"question_id":70153962,"body_markdown":"This worked fine for me be building under Java 8.

Like in the following example:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;plugins&gt;\n[...]\n  &lt;plugin&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-surefire-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;3.0.0-M7&lt;/version&gt; &lt;!-- pick your own version --&gt;\n    &lt;configuration&gt;\n        &lt;forkCount&gt;1&lt;/forkCount&gt;\n        &lt;argLine&gt;--add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector&lt;/argLine&gt;\n    &lt;/configuration&gt;\n  &lt;/plugin&gt;\n[...]\n&lt;/plugins&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/configure.html#mvn-jvm-config-file\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>.mvn/jvm.config</code></a> doesn't work in your case because this configuration is for Maven JVM as sort of alternative for <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/configure.html#maven_opts-environment-variable\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MAVEN_OPTS</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So no need anymore for MAVEN_OPTS... You don't need to use these options in MAVEN_OPTS or switch between different configurations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>About MAVEN_OPTS:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This variable contains parameters used to start up the JVM running Maven and can be used to supply additional options to it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, if forking is disabled (<code>forkCount</code> = 0) then it will work because there will be only one JVM for everything. Otherwise, only <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/fork-options-and-parallel-execution.html#forked-test-execution\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the system properties get passed to a forked JVM</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>System property variables from the main maven process are passed to the forked process as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1208031,"reputation":14071,"user_id":1915854,"accept_rate":63,"display_name":"Serge Rogatch"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":555,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":73966595,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1665052571,"creation_date":1664960927,"question_id":73958179,"body_markdown":"I&#39;ve added SIMD code to a Java application that uses Maven to build, and now I have to run it like this:\r\n\r\n    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=&quot;com.path.to.app.MainClass&quot; -Dexec.classpathScope=runtime -Dexec.systemProperties=&quot;-da --add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector&quot;\r\n\r\nI also created `.mvn/jvm.config` file with the following content:\r\n\r\n    --add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector\r\n\r\nFinally, in `pom.xml` I added the following under `project/build/plugins`:\r\n\r\n            &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n                &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n                &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-compiler-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                &lt;version&gt;3.10.1&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n                    &lt;compilerArgs&gt;\r\n                        &lt;arg&gt;--add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector&lt;/arg&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/compilerArgs&gt;\r\n                &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n            &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n\r\nThe application itself runs from Eclipse and from command-line with Maven as shown above.

Since connecting two distinct subtrees with a single edge creates a new tree, there is no need to check for cycles.\r\n\r\nIf you look at [wiki page][1] algorithm is as follow:\r\n\r\n    1. create a forest **F** (a set of trees), where each vertex in the graph is a separate tree\r\n    2. create a set S containing all the edges in the graph\r\n    3. while S is nonempty and F is not yet spanning\r\n        a. remove an edge with minimum weight from S\r\n        b. if that edge connects two different trees, then add it to the forest, combining \r\n           two trees into a single tree\r\n        c. otherwise discard that edge.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou should use [Disjoint Set Data Structure][2] for this. again from wiki:\r\n\r\n&gt; first sort the edges by weight using a comparison sort in O(E log E)\r\n&gt; time; this allows the step &quot;remove an edge with minimum weight from S&quot;\r\n&gt; to operate in constant time. Next, we use a disjoint-set data\r\n&gt; structure (Union&amp;Find) to keep track of which vertices are in which\r\n&gt; components. We need to perform O(E) operations, two &#39;find&#39; operations\r\n&gt; and possibly one union for each edge. Even a simple disjoint-set data\r\n&gt; structure such as disjoint-set forests with union by rank can perform\r\n&gt; O(E) operations in O(E log V) time. Thus the total time is O(E log E)\r\n&gt; = O(E log V).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#Creating Disjoint Forests\r\nNow you can take a look at [Boost Graph Library-Incremental Components][3] part.\r\nYou should implement some methods: **MakeSet**, **Find**, **Union**, After that you can implement Kruskall&#39;s algorithm. All you doing is working with sets, and simplest possible way to do so is using linked list.\r\n\r\nEach set has one element named as **representative element** which is the first element in the set.\r\n\r\n1- First implement **MakeSet** by linked lists:\r\n\r\n&gt; This prepares the disjoint-sets data structure for the incremental\r\n&gt; connected components algorithm by making each vertex in the graph a\r\n&gt; member of its own component (or set).\r\n\r\nJust initialize each vertex (element) as a representative element of new set, we can do this by setting them as themselves&#39; parent:\r\n\r\n     function MakeSet(x)\r\n       x.parent := x\r\n\r\n2- Implement **Find** method:\r\n\r\nFind representative element of a set that contains a vertex `x`:\r\n\r\n     function Find(x)\r\n     if x.parent == x\r\n        return x\r\n     else\r\n        return Find(x.parent)\r\n\r\nThe `if` part checks the element is representative element or not. we set all representative elements of sets as their first element by setting them as themselves parent.\r\n\r\n3- And finally when all previous steps are done, simple part is implementing the **Union** method:\r\n\r\n    function Union(x, y)\r\n     xRoot := Find(x) // find representative element of first element(set)\r\n     yRoot := Find(y) // find representative element of second element(set)\r\n     xRoot.parent := yRoot // set representative element of first set \r\n                           // as same as representative element of second set\r\n\r\nNow how you should run Kruskall?\r\n\r\nFirst put all nodes in `n` disjoint sets by **MakeSet** method.

All you doing is working with sets, and simplest possible way to do so is using linked list.</p>\n<p>Each set has one element named as <strong>representative element</strong> which is the first element in the set.</p>\n<p>1- First implement <strong>MakeSet</strong> by linked lists:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This prepares the disjoint-sets data structure for the incremental\nconnected components algorithm by making each vertex in the graph a\nmember of its own component (or set).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just initialize each vertex (element) as a representative element of new set, we can do this by setting them as themselves' parent:</p>\n<pre><code> function MakeSet(x)\n   x.parent := x\n</code></pre>\n<p>2- Implement <strong>Find</strong> method:</p>\n<p>Find representative element of a set that contains a vertex <code>x</code>:</p>\n<pre><code> function Find(x)\n if x.parent == x\n    return x\n else\n    return Find(x.parent)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>if</code> part checks the element is representative element or not. we set all representative elements of sets as their first element by setting them as themselves parent.</p>\n<p>3- And finally when all previous steps are done, simple part is implementing the <strong>Union</strong> method:</p>\n<pre><code>function Union(x, y)\n xRoot := Find(x) // find representative element of first element(set)\n yRoot := Find(y) // find representative element of second element(set)\n xRoot.parent := yRoot // set representative element of first set \n                       // as same as representative element of second set\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now how you should run Kruskall?</p>\n<p>First put all nodes in <code>n</code> disjoint sets by <strong>MakeSet</strong> method. In each iteration after finding desired  edge (not marked and minimal one), find related sets of its endpoint vertices by <strong>Find</strong> method (their representative elements), if they are the same, drop this edge out because this edge causes a cycle, but If they are in different sets, use <strong>Union</strong> method to merge these sets.

However when the tree contains around 15000 nodes it is able to be converted to a linked list without a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the code for my toList Method that is inside the splay tree class</p>\n\n<pre><code>public LinkedList&lt;Node&gt; toList() {\n\n   LinkedList&lt;Node&gt; list = new LinkedList&lt;Node&gt;();\n   Node node = root;\n   addToList(node, list);\n\n   return list;\n}\n\nprivate void addToList(Node node, LinkedList&lt;Node&gt; list) {\n   if(node != null) {\n      addToList(node.left, list);\n      list.add(node);\n      addToList(node.right, list);\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I used this test class below to test the function of this method</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Test\npublic void testConversionToLinkedList {\n   SplayTree&lt;Integer,String&gt; st = new SplayTree&lt;Integer,String&gt;();\n   for(int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++) {\n      st.insert(i, Integer.toString(i));\n   }\n   assertEquals(1000000, st.size());\n\n   LinkedList&lt;Node&gt; list = st.toList();\n   assertEquals(1000000, list.size());\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The test passes when the size entered is around 15000, however any number greater than that will show a StackOverFlowError</p>\n\n<p>The error occurs at the line <code>addToList(node.left, list);</code></p>\n\n<p>This is really weird because when i used the same recursion technique to print the data of the nodes into a txt file, there is no StackOverFlow error and the data prints perfectly.</p>\n\n<p>I have tried to use In Order Traversal, PreOrder and PostOrder but I still receive the same error at 1,000,000 nodes. I do know that it could be doing recursion too deeply and the stack runs out of memory. If that is the case is there any way I can convert a splay tree of nodes into a linked list?\nAny idea what could be going wrong? cheers</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","kotlin","augmented-reality","arcore"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":8834917,"reputation":50825,"user_id":6599590,"accept_rate":96,"display_name":"Andy Jazz"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1665051203,"creation_date":1665049988,"answer_id":73971855,"question_id":73970615,"body_markdown":"I&#39;ve found an example demonstrating ARCore texture&#39;s reading app that implements `GLSurfaceView` and its renderer.
