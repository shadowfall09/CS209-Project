the processing of the `Stream` hasn’t even started.\r\n\r\nThe resource management construct “try with resources” works for resources used within a block scope inside a method but you are creating a factory method returning a resource. Therefore you have to ensure that the closing of the returned stream will close the resources and the caller is responsible for closing the `Stream`.\r\n\r\n---\r\nFurther, you need a function which produces an item out of a single line from the `ResultSet`. Supposing, you have a method like\r\n\r\n    Record createRecord(ResultSet rs) {\r\n        …\r\n    }\r\nyou may create a `Stream&lt;Record&gt;` basically like\r\n\r\n    Stream&lt;Record&gt; stream = StreamSupport.stream(new Spliterators.AbstractSpliterator&lt;Record&gt;(\r\n        Long.MAX_VALUE,Spliterator.ORDERED) {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public boolean tryAdvance(Consumer&lt;? super Record&gt; action) {\r\n                if(!resultSet.next()) return false;\r\n                action.accept(createRecord(resultSet));\r\n                return true;\r\n            }\r\n        }, false);\r\n\r\nBut to do it correctly you have to incorporate the exception handling and closing of resources. You can use `Stream.onClose` to register an action that will be performed when the `Stream` gets closed, but it has to be a `Runnable` which can not throw checked exceptions. Similarly the `tryAdvance` method is not allowed to throw checked exceptions. And since we can’t simply nest `try(…)` blocks here, the program logic of suppression exceptions thrown in `close`, when there is already a pending exception, doesn’t come for free.\r\n\r\nTo help us here, we introduce a new type which can wrap closing operations which may throw checked exceptions and deliver them wrapped in an unchecked exception. By implementing `AutoCloseable` itself, it can utilize the `try(…)` construct to chain close operations safely:\r\n\r\n    interface UncheckedCloseable extends Runnable, AutoCloseable {\r\n        default void run() {\r\n            try { close(); } catch(Exception ex) { throw new RuntimeException(ex); }\r\n        }\r\n        static UncheckedCloseable wrap(AutoCloseable c) {\r\n            return c::close;\r\n        }\r\n        default UncheckedCloseable nest(AutoCloseable c) {\r\n            return ()-&gt;{ try(UncheckedCloseable c1=this) { c.close(); } };\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWith this, the entire operation becomes:\r\n\r\n    private Stream&lt;Record&gt; tableAsStream(DataSource dataSource, String table)\r\n        throws SQLException {\r\n\r\n        UncheckedCloseable close=null;\r\n        try {\r\n            Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection();\r\n            close=UncheckedCloseable.wrap(connection);\r\n            String sql = &quot;select * from &quot; + table;\r\n            PreparedStatement pSt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);\r\n            close=close.nest(pSt);\r\n            connection.setAutoCommit(false);\r\n            pSt.setFetchSize(5000);\r\n            ResultSet resultSet = pSt.executeQuery();\r\n            close=close.nest(resultSet);\r\n            return StreamSupport.stream(new Spliterators.AbstractSpliterator&lt;Record&gt;(\r\n                Long.MAX_VALUE,Spliterator.ORDERED) {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public boolean tryAdvance(Consumer&lt;? super Record&gt; action) {\r\n                    try {\r\n                        if(!resultSet.next()) return false;\r\n                        action.accept(createRecord(resultSet));\r\n                        return true;\r\n                    } catch(SQLException ex) {\r\n                        throw new RuntimeException(ex);\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }, false).onClose(close);\r\n        } catch(SQLException sqlEx) {\r\n            if(close!=null)\r\n                try { close.close(); } catch(Exception ex) { sqlEx.addSuppressed(ex); }\r\n            throw sqlEx;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\nThis method wraps the necessary close operation for all resources, `Connection`, `Statement` and `ResultSet` within one instance of the utility class described above. If an exception happens during the initialization, the close operation is performed immediately and the exception is delivered to the caller. If the stream construction succeeds, the close operation is registered via `onClose`.\r\n\r\nTherefore the caller has to ensure proper closing like\r\n\r\n    try(Stream&lt;Record&gt; s=tableAsStream(dataSource, table)) {\r\n        // stream operation\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote that also the delivery of an `SQLException` via `RuntimeException` has been added to the `tryAdvance` method.

This may be okay for dabbling with JavaFX. But for professional development, you will likely want your project to be modularized so you can use [*jlink*](https://openjdk.org/jeps/282) to bundle a slimmed-down JVM as part of your final app artifact. This lack of modularization surprised me as the Maven edition of their new-project template does indeed produce a project already configured to be modularized.\r\n\r\n## JDK bundled with JavaFX\r\n\r\nAt least two of the several JDK vendors provide an edition of the JDK products that include the necessary OpenJFX libraries that implement JavaFX.\r\n\r\n - *ZuluFX* by [Azul Systems][9] ([Wikipedia][10])\r\n - *LibericaFX* by [BellSoft][11]\r\n\r\nThose companies may also sell support for JavaFX, as might the co-leaders of JavaFX, Gluon and Oracle.\r\n\r\nTo most easily download and install these JDKs, I suggest installing [SDKMAN!][12] on your Mac. That handy bundle of shell scripts makes the download/install/uninstall chore quite simple and convenient. Just run this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n% sdk install java 17.0.8.fx-zulu  \r\n```\r\n\r\n… to get this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nDownloading: java 17.0.8.fx-zulu\r\n\r\nIn progress...\r\n\r\n########################################################################################################################### 100.0%\r\n\r\nRepackaging Java 17.0.8.fx-zulu...\r\n\r\nDone repackaging...\r\n\r\nInstalling: java 17.0.8.fx-zulu\r\nDone installing!\r\n\r\nDo you want java 17.0.8.fx-zulu to be set as default?

You may see options for [*aarch64*][18] or [*ARM*][19], which are compatible with Apple Silicon. \r\n\r\n - I am guessing Gradle must automatically detect your host environment and download the appropriate version. \r\n - If using the bundled-with-JDK route, for your particular Mac, be sure to obtain an edition for macOS on Apple Silicon/aarch65/ARM rather than for Intel/x64/x86-64 in older Macs.\r\n\r\nYour error message suggests that you have indeed installed for the wrong chip architecture:\r\n\r\n&gt;mach-o file, but is an incompatible architecture (have (x86_64), need (arm64e)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System\r\n  [2]: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradle\r\n  [4]: https://openjfx.io/\r\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaFX\r\n  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA\r\n  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\r\n  [8]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/F7Mi0.jpg\r\n  [9]: https://www.azul.com/\r\n  [10]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azul_Systems\r\n  [11]: https://bell-sw.com/\r\n  [12]: https://sdkman.io/\r\n  [13]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system\r\n  [14]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture\r\n  [15]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon#Apple_M1\r\n  [16]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS\r\n  [17]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon\r\n  [18]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64\r\n  [19]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family","title":"How and where can I download JavaFX on M1 Mac?","body":"<h1>tl;dr</h1>\n<p>You seem to have two problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Missing <code>module-java.java</code> file necessary for a modularized app</li>\n<li>Wrong installation of JavaFX, for Intel chips rather than Apple Silicon chips like the M1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Modularize</h1>\n<p>Apparently some part of your configuration, or some library, expects your project to be modularized per <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Java Platform Module System (JPMS)</a>.

Is my understanding correct ?</p>\n<p>•   Any content downloaded to the “data” folder can be viewed as temporary area where content of blob are saved into a unique filename.\nThe file in the “data” folder can  be deleted.\nShould the blob content be needed again, the blob can be downloaded again to a file in data folder. ?</p>\n<p>•   Each BlobClient instance is associated with one blob ?</p>\n<p>•   The BlobClient instance can be used to upload content into blob or download the blob content ?</p>\n<p>•   The blob is identified by the filename passed when the BlobClient is created ?</p>\n<p>•   Each blob stored must be associated with unique filename ?</p>\n<p>•   The blob stored with 1st line will be over written with the content of filename by the 2nd line\nline 1 -   blobClient.uploadFromFile(localPath + fileName);\nline 2 -   blobClient.uploadFromFile(localPath + fileName);</p>\n<p>The point I just wanted to confirm was that content stored by a blob can be overwritten</p>\n<p>•   The sample code is basic.

Unless the java code that made the thread explicitly picks stack size, in which case it&#39;ll be that. Note that many earlier JVMs were bugged and would silently ignore any stack size specified that didn&#39;t evenly divide into some OS-enforced window size. JVMs also declare some more memory that it uses for itself instead of heap. So, if you pay $100,- a month for 2GB, but the costs go up to $400,- if you exceeds it, then `-Xmx1900m` is far too high.

Note that many earlier JVMs were bugged and would silently ignore any stack size specified that didn't evenly divide into some OS-enforced window size. JVMs also declare some more memory that it uses for itself instead of heap. So, if you pay $100,- a month for 2GB, but the costs go up to $400,- if you exceeds it, then <code>-Xmx1900m</code> is far too high. If you're trying to optimize, consider toying with <code>-Xss</code> and see how low you can make that without running into StackOverflowErrors.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":27360116,"reputation":11,"user_id":20867862,"display_name":"Zongrong Li"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1693226005,"creation_date":1692627917,"question_id":76946232,"body_markdown":"We have a Java application whoes consuming memory is constantly increasing.

The try-catch block will catch the `NumberFormatException` and print a message indicating that the value is invalid.\r\n\r\nHere is the modified code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\r\n\r\n  Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n\r\n  String hex;\r\n  char choice = &#39;y&#39;;\r\n  boolean isValid = false;\r\n\r\n  do {\r\n    System.out.print(&quot;Do you want to enter a hexadecimal number? &quot;);\r\n    System.out.print(&quot;y or n?: &quot;);\r\n    choice = keyboard.next().charAt(0);\r\n\r\n    switch (choice) {\r\n      case &#39;y&#39;:\r\n        System.out.print(&quot;Enter a hexadecimal number: #&quot;);\r\n        hex = keyboard.next();\r\n        hex = hex.toUpperCase();\r\n        int hexLength = hex.length();\r\n        isValid = valid(hex);\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n          Integer value = Integer.parseInt(hex, 16);\r\n          System.out.println(&quot;The value: &quot; + value);\r\n\r\n          if (isValid) {\r\n            System.out.println(hex + &quot; is valid&quot;);\r\n          }\r\n        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {\r\n          System.out.println(hex + &quot; is invalid&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        break;\r\n      case &#39;n&#39;:\r\n        System.out.print(&quot;Quit&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n  } while (choice != &#39;n&#39;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code will first check if the value entered is valid using the `valid()` method.

Below are the two code snippets I've been working with:</p>\n<p>Code Snippet 1 (2 Loops) (My Code):</p>\n<pre><code>public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {\n    int[] result = new int[nums.length];\n    result[0] = 1;\n\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; nums.length - 1; i++){\n        result[i+1] = nums[i] * result[i];\n    }\n\n    int product = 1;\n    for(int i = nums.length - 1; i &gt; 0; i--){\n        result[i-1] = nums[i] * result[i - 1] * product;\n        product = product * nums[i];\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Code Snippet 2 (3 Loops) (Code that takes 1ms):</p>\n<pre><code>public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {\n    int res[] = new int[nums.length];\n    \n    for(int num: nums) {\n        num = 1;\n    }\n\n    int prefix = 1;\n    for(int i=0; i&lt;nums.length; i++) {\n        res[i] = prefix;\n        prefix *= nums[i];\n    }\n    int postfix = 1;\n    for(int i=nums.length-1; i&gt;=0; i--) {\n        res[i] *= postfix;\n        postfix *= nums[i];\n    }\n\n    return res;\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Both code snippets have an O(n) time complexity and solve the same problem, which makes the performance difference even more intriguing.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","android-edittext","textview"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1102504,"reputation":66096,"user_id":1094597,"accept_rate":94,"display_name":"kosa"},"score":0,"creation_date":1335994328,"post_id":10421758,"comment_id":13448638,"body_markdown":"You need to use Relative Layout with combination of TextView and EditText.","body":"You need to use Relative Layout with combination of TextView and EditText."},{"owner":{"account_id":1429910,"reputation":75,"user_id":1352547,"display_name":"Civitas"},"score":0,"creation_date":1335994920,"post_id":10421758,"comment_id":13448822,"body_markdown":"problem is how will i know where to place my edittext in the RelativeLayout.

The `datetime` type resolves to 100-nanosecond units. \r\n\r\n## `java.time.Instant`\r\n\r\nIn Java, the `Instant` class represents a moment as seen in UTC. This type has a finer resolution, down to [nanoseconds][7]. \r\n\r\nSo, the `Instant` class in Java is the natural counterpart to `datetime` in Kusto. \r\n\r\n## `java.time.OffsetDateTime`\r\n\r\nHowever, your Java driver for Kusto may use another type, if it abides by the [JDBC][8] specification. JDBC is oriented to the [SQL][9] standard. Per that standard, the Java class `OffsetDateTime` is mapped to columns of a type akin to the SQL standard type `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`. \r\n\r\nAn `OffsetDateTime` is similar to `Instant` in that in represents a date and time-of-day as seen in a particular offset from UTC. In `OffsetDateTime`, the offset can be any number of hours-minutes-seconds whereas in `Instant` the offset is always zero. \r\n\r\nAlso, `Instant` is the basic building-block class within the *java.time* framework.

(regardless of what it is) with an unreasonable degree of probability.\r\n\r\nAs others have suggested, I then took the model and imported it into a python program that will test the model by giving it a random input array:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport tensorflow as tf\r\n\r\n# Load TFLite model and allocate tensors.\r\ninterpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path=&quot;model.tflite&quot;)\r\ninterpreter.allocate_tensors()\r\n\r\n# Get input and output tensors.\r\ninput_details = interpreter.get_input_details()\r\noutput_details = interpreter.get_output_details()\r\n\r\n# Test model on random input data.\r\ninput_shape = input_details[0][&#39;shape&#39;]\r\ninput_data = np.array(255* np.random.random_sample(input_shape), dtype=np.uint8)\r\n#print(input_data)\r\n\r\ninterpreter.set_tensor(input_details[0][&#39;index&#39;], input_data)\r\n\r\ninterpreter.invoke()\r\n\r\n# The function `get_tensor()` returns a copy of the tensor data.\r\n# Use `tensor()` in order to get a pointer to the tensor.\r\noutput_data = interpreter.get_tensor(output_details[0][&#39;index&#39;])\r\nprint(output_data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output of which is as follows (run three times):\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nruncell(0, &#39;C:/Users/willi/untitled0.py&#39;)\r\n[[2.7504451e-05 5.5880201e-07 7.1274367e-06 2.6180421e-06 9.1017710e-06\r\n

there is a problem with the model.\r\n\r\nAfter following other suggestions I have checked the input shape (which looks fine) and the input type (uint-8) which again seems fine (I would expect to see an error if it was not?). The model was trained including a layer to normalise the 0-255 input to 0-1.\r\n\r\nI still have a feeling that the input type/shape is the issue but I don&#39;t know how to solve this. Any guidance will be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n","title":"Tensorflow Lite model predicting the same output with random input","body":"<p>I have trained a tensorflow neural network on the Fashion MNIST dataset(<a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist</a>) in order to recognise different clothing types.</p>\n<p>The model works well with reasonable accuracy (~0.89) when training and testing.
