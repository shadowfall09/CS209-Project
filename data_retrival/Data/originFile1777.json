Memory-Mapped Files.\r\n\r\nJava operates quite well with memory mapped files.   The actual data resides on disk, but the operating system makes it seem (to Java) like the data is in memory.   Java can operate on this data without using heap.  The file sizes can be quite large (gigabytes) and you can have more than one mapped at a time.  \r\nPeter Lawrey&#39;s Chronicle project makes use of memory mapped files for high-performance access to massive amounts of data.  Here is a blog post by @peter-lawrey (who is very active on StackOverflow and will probably comment here shortly) describes how memory mapped files can be used to create the appearance of an [8TB matrix of doubles.][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://vanillajava.blogspot.com/2011/12/using-memory-mapped-file-for-huge.html","title":"Getting Java OutOfMemory Heap Space error while generating large arrays of type double (&gt; 60 million obs)","body":"<ol>\n<li>Use the correct JRE</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Is your hardware 32-bit or 64-bit?

So short of restarting Eclipse, can I limit the Console output via a config file or something that will take effect immediately?  I can't do it through the GUI because the error windows won't go away (Specifically a dialog with heading \"Internal Error\" that wants me to close Eclipse). I believe the program is still running properly, so I think (hope) in the worst case that I just won't get the progress report anymore.  </p>\n\n<p>So, is there anything I can do?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","eclipse","api","heap-memory"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":5397431,"reputation":5255,"user_id":4298200,"accept_rate":62,"display_name":"Neuron"},"score":1,"creation_date":1516104213,"post_id":48280638,"comment_id":83545100,"body_markdown":"Welcome to SO.

It will not let you run Tomcat as anything other than the system account, no matter what you do.  It appears that the system account does not have privileges to write <code>.hprof</code> files in the current directory, and no amount of Windows security tweaking appears to make this problem go away.</p>\n\n<p>OK, so you've installed Tomcat from the <code>.zip</code> distribution.  Install it as a service using the <code>service.bat</code> script.  Make sure it is set to run as a specific user that you created specifically for this purpose.  Make sure as well that the folder you want Tomcat to write to in the event of a heap dump is writable by that user.</p>\n\n<p>Edit the <code>service.bat</code> file to include the <code>-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError</code> and the <code>-XX:HeapDumpPath=C:\\whatever</code> options in the correct place (where you can put JVM options).  That should do the trick.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2496585,"reputation":1681,"user_id":2172800,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"Adeel Ahmad"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1391081494,"creation_date":1363329537,"answer_id":15426270,"question_id":2172220,"body_markdown":"if you have installed tomcat with .exe you can configure tomcat service to use account other than local system account and you can assign that user rights on directory &quot;c:\\whatever&quot; where you are creating your dump file. one thing here to remember tomcat service don&#39;t run with account having administrative privileges. so create a simple user in windows(member of user group) and set tomcat services to user this account. and give that user rights on &quot;c:\\whatever&quot; directory.

The way I've done it in the past is to start another process to run either the <code>ps</code> command on Unix-like systems, or the <code>tasklist</code> command on Windows, and then parse the output of that command for the PID I want.  In reality, I ended up putting that code into a separate shell script for each platform which just returned the PID, so that I could keep the Java piece as platform independent as possible.  This doesn't work well for short-lived tasks, but that wasn't an issue for me.  </p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":331275,"reputation":3837,"user_id":655855,"display_name":"Shamit Verma"},"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":27,"is_accepted":false,"score":23,"last_activity_date":1302168744,"creation_date":1302168744,"answer_id":5578924,"question_id":4750470,"body_markdown":"This page has the HOWTO:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.golesny.de/p/code/javagetpid\r\n\r\nOn Windows:\r\n\r\n    Runtime.exec(..)\r\n\r\nReturns an instance of &quot;java.lang.Win32Process&quot;) OR &quot;java.lang.ProcessImpl&quot;\r\n\r\nBoth have a private field &quot;handle&quot;.\r\n\r\nThis is an OS handle for the process.

Having a builder at the level of an abstract class typically lets the builder decide which concrete subclass of <code>A</code> to instantiate, depending on parameters collected in the building process.</p>\n<p>The idea behind that approach is that the caller isn't interested in the concrete class, just in the fact that it's an <code>A</code> subclass, and the builder is free to provide the instance that best suits the building request.</p>\n<p>If your situation is different, in that the user wants to decide on the resulting class, then you'd create multiple builders, and maybe have them inherit common parts from an (abstract) parent builder. But in such a situation, ask yourself whether using a builder has enough benefit over directly using a constructor to warrant the additional boilerplate code. And with constructors, you immediately get inheritance for free.</p>\n<p>The fact that something like a &quot;builder pattern&quot; exists doesn't imply that it fulfills your requirements.</p>\n<p>So, to summarize the options I see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a builder at the <code>A</code> level that decides (in the <code>build()</code> method) which subclass to instantiate (if your users aren't interested in the concrete class, just &quot;any <code>A</code> implementation&quot;),</li>\n<li>Have multiple builders, one for each subclass. To avoid code repetition, they can inherit from an abstract builder at the <code>A</code> class level. This gives complete control over the resulting type to the user.</li>\n<li>Ignore the builder pattern, and use plain old constructors.</li>\n</ul>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":15038882,"reputation":409,"user_id":10854248,"display_name":"Jannik"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1518,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":70292592,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1639064108,"creation_date":1639062196,"question_id":70292100,"body_markdown":"I hope this isn&#39;t a duplicate; I know there are some similarly named questions but none of them seemed to solve my problem.\r\n\r\nI have multiple classes that are exactly the same - apart from one specific method.

Move `Builder` class down to the subclasses of `A`, so they can be instantiated. This would result in a lot of redundant code, since all attributes the builder sets are identical.\r\n\r\n2.

I have researched how to change the port with spring boot and added it to a Procfile and application.properties file. I also tried system.properties and even a .env file, but none of it is working. I also commented out all the code relating to the database, because that wouldn't work on Heroku without also hosting the database.
