I have written a test to illustrate this:</p>\n<pre><code>public class Tests {\n  @Test\n  public void test() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {\n    var channel = new EmbeddedChannel(new EchoHandler());\n    channel.writeInbound(&quot;delay&quot;, &quot;second message&quot;);\n\n    // Let some time pass and process any scheduled tasks\n    Thread.sleep(500);\n    channel.runPendingTasks();\n\n    // The response to the last message comes first!\n    var firstMessage = (String) channel.readOutbound();\n    Assertions.assertEquals(&quot;second message&quot;, firstMessage);\n\n    // The response to the first message comes second!\n    var secondMessage = (String) channel.readOutbound();\n    Assertions.assertEquals(&quot;delay&quot;, secondMessage);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Question</h2>\n<p>I am looking for a built-in way in Netty to guarantee the order of the outgoing responses matches the order of the incoming messages. Using an imaginary extension of the library, I would rewrite the handler as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>@Override\npublic void channelRead(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, Object msg) {\n  var message = (String) msg;\n\n  ctx.pauseMessageProcessing(); // Upcoming messages will be temporarily queued\n  \n  if (message.equals(&quot;delay&quot;)) {\n    ctx.executor().schedule(() -&gt; {\n      ctx.writeAndFlush(message);\n      ctx.resumeMessageProcessing(); // After flushing we can resume message processing\n    }, 400, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);\n  } else {\n    ctx.writeAndFlush(message);\n    ctx.resumeMessageProcessing(); // After flushing we can resume message processing\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Does Netty provide something like this out of the box? It sounds like a common use case and I'd much rather rely on battle-tested code than writing my own queuing implementation.</p>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","java","api","video","iframe"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":17444879,"reputation":94,"user_id":12646131,"display_name":"jbritain"},"score":2,"creation_date":1639331077,"post_id":70326032,"comment_id":124316034,"body_markdown":"What actual content is within the iFrame?

That project resulted in the *java.time* classes being built into Java 8 and later.\r\n\r\nIf starting a new project, you should use the *java.time* classes rather than Joda-Time.\r\n\r\nIf maintaining an app that already uses Joda-Time, you may continue using Joda-Time. The project is maintained with updates to the [*tz* database][7], and with any crucial bug fixes. But since no further feature work is being done, consider planning for a migration to *java.time* when convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven\r\n  [2]: https://www.joda.org/joda-time/\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven#Project_Object_Model\r\n  [4]: https://maven.apache.org/archetypes/maven-archetype-quickstart/\r\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_mode\r\n  [6]: https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310\r\n  [7]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database","title":"How can i find Joda-Time Jar file on my Mac?","body":"<h1>tl;dr</h1>\n<p>Look in the <code>.m2</code> folder maintained by Maven, where its downloads are kept.</p>\n<h1><em>Joda-Time</em></h1>\n<p>If using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apache Maven</a> as your dependency manager, visit the <a href=\"https://www.joda.org/joda-time/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Joda-Time</em></a> web site to find the needed entry for your <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven#Project_Object_Model\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">POM</a> file.</p>\n<p>Currently:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;joda-time&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;joda-time&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;2.10.13&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is an example POM created by starting a new project with the <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/archetypes/maven-archetype-quickstart/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apache Maven Quickstart</a> archetype.

In your example you will get `[1, -1, 0, 1, -1]`. **Edit:** With thanks to the comment by maaartinus since only a count of pairs is asked for, we also only need a count of each calculated difference. So for each difference, store how many times it occurs as a positive difference and how many as a negative. Use a map with the calculated difference as key:\r\n\r\n    0 -&gt; 1 occurrence (index 2)\r\n    1 -&gt; 2 negative occurrences (indices 1, 4), 2 positive occurrences (indices 0, 3).\r\n\r\nThe concrete indices are not stored, I have only included them as explanation.

So in your example case we have only:\r\n\r\n    1 -&gt; 2 negative occurrences, 2 positive occurrences\r\n\r\nNow our goal can be reached by combining each index from entry with key `-n` and with each index from entry `n`. We need to sort each pair such that the other condition, `i &lt; j` is fulfilled. This is always possible since the same index will not be counted as both positive and negative. So the number of pairs from entry `n` of the map is the product of the two counts of negative and positive occurrences. In your case you have only one `n`, in other cases there could be many, so add the numbers of pairs from them all together. In the example we have just 2 * 2 = 4 pairs. This result agrees with your question.\r\n\r\nEdit: Complexity consideration: The complexity of my approach depends on the complexity of the map operations, which in turn depend on the map implementation you choose. For most map implementations the construction of the map will be the time consuming part, and it will take O(n * cost of map lookup). Assuming that lookup in a `HashMap` is somewhere between linear and O(log n) you can get something between O(n) and O(n * log n).

I&#39;m not to concenered about the courses knowing anything to do with the students hence it&#39;s unidirectional. \r\n\r\nSo my overall question is why don&#39;t the other students have the courses saved to them?

I can see from the logs that the students do have the course saved to them but when i view all the students, only one student has the courses associated to it and the other students have no courses.</p>\n<p>I'm suspecting it's because I'm using a <code>@OneToMany</code> from the Student to Courses.. but to me it makes sense for it to be a unidirectional OneToMany (in this context) since <strong>A</strong> student can have <strong>MULTIPLE</strong> courses. I'm not to concenered about the courses knowing anything to do with the students hence it's unidirectional.</p>\n<p>So my overall question is why don't the other students have the courses saved to them? Why is it only one student?</p>\n<p>Edit = This is the output after using Many to Many (I have updated the students and courses entites too. I updated the Student's toString method so it's easier to see whats going on in the logs too.):</p>\n<pre><code>*************The following department has been saved*************\n2021-12-11 20:56:25.811  INFO 11980 --- [           main] o.h.h.i.QueryTranslatorFactoryInitiator  : HHH000397: Using ASTQueryTranslatorFactory\nDepartment{id=5, name='CompSci', courses=[]}\n\n*************Original Students*************\nStudent{studentId=1,  firstName='jane', lastname='doe' , fullTime=true, age=20 , course=}\n\nStudent{studentId=2,  firstName='john', lastname='doe' , fullTime=true, age=22 , course=}\n\nStudent{studentId=3,  firstName='mike', lastname='smith' , fullTime=true, age=18 , course=}\n\nStudent{studentId=4,  firstName='ally', lastname='kim' , fullTime=false, age=19 , course=}\n\n\n*************Printing courses*************\nCourse{id=6, name='Algorithm', department=CompSci}\nCourse{id=7, name='Databases', department=CompSci}\nStudent{studentId=1,  firstName='jane', lastname='doe' , fullTime=true, age=21 , course=AlgorithmDatabases}\n\nStudent{studentId=2,  firstName='john', lastname='doe' , fullTime=true, age=23 , course=AlgorithmDatabases}\n\nStudent{studentId=3,  firstName='mike', lastname='smith' , fullTime=true, age=19 , course=AlgorithmDatabases}\n\nStudent{studentId=4,  firstName='ally', lastname='kim' , fullTime=false, age=20 , course=AlgorithmDatabases}\n\n\n*************Students a year older and course added*************\nStudent{studentId=1,  firstName='jane', lastname='doe' , fullTime=true, age=21 , course=}\n\nStudent{studentId=2,  firstName='john', lastname='doe' , fullTime=true, age=23 , course=}\n\nStudent{studentId=3,  firstName='mike', lastname='smith' , fullTime=true, age=19 , course=}\n\nStudent{studentId=4,  firstName='ally', lastname='kim' , fullTime=false, age=20 , course=}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","json"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1575209,"reputation":10468,"user_id":1461862,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"Mauricio Gracia Gutierrez"},"score":0,"creation_date":1639327946,"post_id":70325563,"comment_id":124315241,"body_markdown":"Does using `JSONObject` insted helps ? - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39979590/a-jsonarray-text-must-start-with-at-1-character-2-line-1","body":"Does using <code>JSONObject</code> insted helps ? - <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39979590/a-jsonarray-text-must-start-with-at-1-character-2-line-1\" title=\"a jsonarray text must start with at 1 character 2 line 1\">stackoverflow.com/questions/39979590/&hellip;</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":2824099,"reputation":1159,"user_id":2427078,"accept_rate":45,"display_name":"Mandrek"},"score":0,"creation_date":1639328067,"post_id":70325563,"comment_id":124315276,"body_markdown":"@MauricioGraciaGutierrez already used see my code  JSONObject exprObject = jsonArray.getJSONObject(i);","body":"@MauricioGraciaGutierrez already used see my code  JSONObject exprObject = jsonArray.getJSONObject(i);"},{"owner":{"account_id":1575209,"reputation":10468,"user_id":1461862,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"Mauricio Gracia Gutierrez"},"score":0,"creation_date":1639328351,"post_id":70325563,"comment_id":124315352,"body_markdown":"use it instead of `new JSONArray` and also try it removing the square brackets","body":"use it instead of <code>new JSONArray</code> and also try it removing the square brackets"},{"owner":{"account_id":2485939,"reputation":19426,"user_id":2164365,"accept_rate":40,"display_name":"Abra"},"score":1,"creation_date":1639335025,"post_id":70325563,"comment_id":124316965,"body_markdown":"Your date string looks strange: `2021-0916` Shouldn&#39;t that be `2021-09-16` ?","body":"Your date string looks strange: <code>2021-0916</code> Shouldn&#39;t that be <code>2021-09-16</code> ?"},{"owner":{"account_id":1575209,"reputation":10468,"user_id":1461862,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"Mauricio Gracia Gutierrez"},"score":0,"creation_date":1639411394,"post_id":70325563,"comment_id":124335803,"body_markdown":"Does this answer your question?

0 and y &gt; 0` is the required condition for any step `(x, y)`.\r\n\r\nNow, let&#39;s say,\r\n\r\n    Step k:   (a, b)  \r\n    Step k+1: (a2, b2) = (a+b, b) OR (a, a+b)\r\n\r\nSo  if we want to derive `step#k` from `step#k+1` then we can say `(a, b)` can be one of these two: `(a2 - b2, b2) OR (a2, b2 - a2)`. We can **easily remove one option** as we know that `a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0`.\r\n* If `(a2 - b2) &gt; 0` then `(a, b)` must be `(a2 - b2, b2)`.\r\n* Similarly, if `(b2 - a2) &gt; 0` then `(a, b)` must be `(a2, b2 - a2)`.  \r\n* If `a2 == b2` (and not `1`) then `a2 - b2` and `b2 - a2` will be `0` which is impossible as `a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0` is required condition.\r\n\r\nSo, we will start from destination `(x, y)` and try to reach `(1, 1)` by above observation in **linear time**. The gist will be:\r\n```java\r\nstatic boolean solve(int x, int y) {\r\n    if (x == 1 &amp;&amp; y == 1) {\r\n    \treturn true;\r\n    }\r\n    if (x == y || x &lt; 1 || y &lt; 1) {\r\n    \treturn false;\r\n    }\r\n    if (x &gt; y) {\r\n    \treturn solve(x - y, y);\r\n    } else {\r\n    \treturn solve(x, y - x);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbove solution is recursive and Ole V.V. has a good point in [this answer][1] about possible `StackOverflowError` if input numbers are large and stack memory allocation is relatively less. Based on his suggestion of the need of iterative solution, I am providing below gist for iterative approach:\r\n```java\r\nstatic boolean solve(int x, int y) {\r\n\twhile (x &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; y &gt; 0) {\r\n\t    if (x == y) {\r\n\t        return (x == 1); // x and y can be same if they are 1, otherwise impossible\r\n\t    }\r\n\t    if (x &gt; y) {\r\n\t        x = x - y;\r\n\t    } else {\r\n\t    \ty = y - x;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/63967447/2309920","title":"Assuming initial position is (1, 1), find out if you can reach (x, y) by the following given rules at each step","body":"<p>Your question says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the current position is (a,b) then in the next move, you can move only to (a+b,b) or (a,a+b).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your <em>mistakes</em> are (highlighted inline in <strong>bold</strong>):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>if(sol(a+b, <strong>a</strong>, x, y)) return true; // a should be b</code></li>\n<li><code>if(sol(a, a+b, x, y)) return <strong>false</strong>; // false should be true</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Correct both points</em> with (highlighted inline in <strong>bold</strong>):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>if(sol(a+b, <strong>b</strong>, x, y)) return true;</code></li>\n<li><code>if(sol(a, a+b, x, y)) return <strong>true</strong>;</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>OR simplify by combining them:\n<code>if(sol(a+b, <strong>b</strong>, x, y) || sol(a, a+b, x, y)) return true;</code></p>\n<p>With above suggestion full code would be:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import java.util.*;\nclass Solution {\n    static boolean sol(int a, int b, int x, int y) {\n        if(a == x &amp;&amp; b == y)\n            return true;\n        else if(a &gt; x || b &gt; y)\n            return false;\n        else if(sol(a+b, b, x, y) || sol(a, a+b, x, y)) // fix applied here\n            return true;\n        return false;\n    }\n    static String ans(int x, int y) {\n        if(sol(1, 1, x, y)) return &quot;Yes&quot;;\n        return &quot;No&quot;;\n    }\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int x, int y;\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n        x = sc.nextInt();\n        y = sc.nextInt();\n        System.out.println(ans(x, y));\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<h3>Edit for optimized solution than brute force</h3>\n<p>We are starting with <code>(1, 1)</code> and any next step of <code>(a, b)</code> is <code>(a+b, b) or (a, a+b)</code> so <code>x &gt; 0 and y &gt; 0</code> is the required condition for any step <code>(x, y)</code>.</p>\n<p>Now, let's say,</p>\n<pre><code>Step k:   (a, b)  \nStep k+1: (a2, b2) = (a+b, b) OR (a, a+b)\n</code></pre>\n<p>So  if we want to derive <code>step#k</code> from <code>step#k+1</code> then we can say <code>(a, b)</code> can be one of these two: <code>(a2 - b2, b2) OR (a2, b2 - a2)</code>.

Then they each can be adding results into the same collection.</p>\n<p>Any other solution probably means that each job returns a <code>List</code> and as you join with the jobs you add the per-job list into a final list.</p>\n<pre><code>ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(NUM_THREADS);\nList&lt;Future&lt;List&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;&gt; futures = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; NUM_JOBS; i++) {\n    // add another job to the thread-pool and record the future\n    futures.add(threadPool.submit(new Callable&lt;List&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;() {\n        @Override\n        public List&lt;Foo&gt; call() throws Exception {\n            // create the list here\n            return list;\n        }\n    });\n}\n// shutdown the pool but the jobs continue running\nthreadPool.shutdown();\nList&lt;Foo&gt; finalList = new ArrayList&lt;Foo&gt;();\nfor (Future&lt;List&lt;Foo&gt;&gt; future : futures) {\n    // calling get waits for each job to finish in order\n    // we add all of the results from the job list into the final list\n    finalList.addAll(future.get());\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This waits for each of the jobs in order.  If you want to add the results into the list as they finish then you can use a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorCompletionService.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ExecutorCompletionService</a>.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":9615182,"reputation":235,"user_id":7138221,"display_name":"VKR"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":593,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":70296041,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1639324661,"creation_date":1639078683,"question_id":70295772,"body_markdown":"I want execute some java logic with multiple threads and that method return a List.
