I'm attempting to do this by reading the text file via a BufferedReader within the read() method in my main method. In this method, I validate the inputs passed through reader and return true if they match any contents of the input.txt file. If they return false by not fitting the parameters I've set, the program should halt and send a println message. However I notice that when I call it within the if statement after the scanner inputs, the program completely skips over the if statement and the read() method. I've tried experimenting around with different ideas and structure, but nothing has been successful. No matter what incorrect variables I input into the scanner, they are all allowed to pass because my code isn't calling the read() method.

To manage this, I&#39;ve set up a parent layout, a ConstraintLayout, to contain these two layouts. Using WindowManager.addView(), I present this ConstraintLayout to the user along with WindowManager.LayoutParams. These parameters ensure the ConstraintLayout accommodates the initially displayed layout among the two.\r\n\r\nThe ConstraintLayout serves as an overlay and should seamlessly overlay other applications. The displayed layout supports click events but isn&#39;t focusable. Moreover, the setup ensures that click events within this layout do not interfere with other parts of the screen.\r\n\r\n# The Actual Problem:\r\n# \r\nUpon attempting to resize the ConstraintLayout added by the WindowManager, an issue arises. The layout momentarily shifts to an unexpected position before swiftly returning to its intended place.

Generational garbage collectors divide objects into different generations based on their age.\r\n\r\nDisconnecting all links between nodes helps in scenarios where discarded nodes may exist in more than one generation. By breaking all connections, it ensures that these nodes can be collected more effectively.\r\n\r\nReachability for Iterators:\r\n\r\nClearing links between nodes ensures that even if there is a reachable Iterator or other references, the nodes themselves are not reachable through the linked list structure. This guarantees that the nodes are eligible for garbage collection.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, objects might be indirectly referenced through iterators or other external references, and breaking internal links helps ensure that the nodes are not retained in memory due to such external references.\r\n\r\nIn practical terms, whether to clear all links between nodes depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of your application. If you are confident that there are no external references holding onto nodes, you might consider omitting this step for performance reasons.

From what I understand the `EvaluationContextExtensionSupport` class has been deprecated in the later versions of spring. But since I am not making use of this class directly in my application and all others depencecies seem to be upgraded to the correct version, I am not sure how to proceed further.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated, thanks!\r\n\r\nEdit(s):\r\n\r\n 1.

My architecture of application is: front-end \n<strong>Angular 2/typescript</strong>, backend: <strong>java, spring boot</strong> (and submodules). Everything works fine but I've got problem with understanding how to make video streaming. I was looking for any framework to do it but I've failed. As I understand WebSocket doesn't help me in this task and it's no appropriate to use it. Also as I understand Spring doesn't have any tool to solve the task. Is it really that I have to create streaming via clean UDP which exists in java or maybe there is another way, any framework which gives more higher interfaces for the task?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","html","xpath","jsoup"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4181404,"reputation":6036,"user_id":3426328,"accept_rate":83,"display_name":"TDG"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1699169205,"creation_date":1699169205,"answer_id":77425076,"question_id":77424918,"body_markdown":"You can get your desired text by using -  \r\n\r\n    Elements el = doc.select(&quot;p:has(strong)&quot;);\r\n\t\tfor (Element e : el) {\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(e.ownText());\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\nThis will find all the `p` elements in the html that contains also `strong`, and print the text that belongs only to the `p` but not to the `strong` -\r\n&gt;bat, butterfly, moth    \r\n\r\nIf you use `e.text()` instead, you will get all the text in the `p` element - \r\n&gt; Popular resonses: bat, butterfly, moth\r\n\r\nIf you have only one such element you can also use -  \r\n\r\n    Element e = doc.select(&quot;p:has(strong)&quot;).first();\r\n    System.out.println(e.ownText());\r\nWhich saves you the loop.","title":"Select element value from html via XPath","body":"<p>You can get your desired text by using -</p>\n<pre><code>Elements el = doc.select(&quot;p:has(strong)&quot;);\n    for (Element e : el) {          \n        System.out.println(e.ownText());\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will find all the <code>p</code> elements in the html that contains also <code>strong</code>, and print the text that belongs only to the <code>p</code> but not to the <code>strong</code> -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>bat, butterfly, moth</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you use <code>e.text()</code> instead, you will get all the text in the <code>p</code> element -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Popular resonses: bat, butterfly, moth</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you have only one such element you can also use -</p>\n<pre><code>Element e = doc.select(&quot;p:has(strong)&quot;).first();\nSystem.out.println(e.ownText());\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which saves you the loop.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":51278,"reputation":10472,"user_id":153184,"display_name":"Jonathan Hedley"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1701166997,"creation_date":1701166997,"answer_id":77563075,"question_id":77424918,"body_markdown":"There are a couple ways, depending on just what you want:\r\n\r\nIf you want the TextNode objects:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString html = &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;\r\n    &lt;strong&gt;Popular responses: &lt;/strong&gt;\r\n    bat, butterfly, moth\r\n    &lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;;\r\nDocument doc = Jsoup.parse(html);\r\nList&lt;TextNode&gt; textNodes = doc.selectXpath(&quot;//p/text()&quot;, TextNode.class);\r\nfor (TextNode textNode : textNodes) {\r\n    print(textNode.siblingIndex() + &quot;: &quot; + textNode.text());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGives:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n0:  \r\n2:  bat, butterfly, moth \r\n```\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s the two TextNodes that are directly in that P.
