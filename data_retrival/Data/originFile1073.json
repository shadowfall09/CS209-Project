Generally if you have a couple of activities doing something common like using the same networking layer, showing general error prompts and notifications then the best approach is to put them in a `BaseActivity` and let all your activities extend them. If you may, use OOPS concepts like grouping behaviors into interfaces, defining abstract methods which child activities must extend and stuffs like that. Avoid doing anything specific in the `BaseActivity` and let the child activities take as much control as possible.\r\n\r\n2. If you have to have utility classes, make them singleton and without any state.\r\n\r\n3. Avoid doing async tasks in the utility methods. Remember each component on Android has a lifecycle and any async task you do must be tied to the lifecycle of the hosting component. So for e.g if you are doing a File operation which you think must take a while, then wrap it in a `asynctask` or something in your calling component.\r\n\r\n4. Utility classes are good members for injection (my opinion !!). Try using a DI library like Dagger to make your life easier if you end up using too many utility libraries.","title":"Helper class best approach android","body":"<p>Few points to remember related to use of Utility classes (some of them already touched upon the previous answer) - </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Generally if you have a couple of activities doing something common like using the same networking layer, showing general error prompts and notifications then the best approach is to put them in a <code>BaseActivity</code> and let all your activities extend them.

Remember each component on Android has a lifecycle and any async task you do must be tied to the lifecycle of the hosting component. So for e.g if you are doing a File operation which you think must take a while, then wrap it in a <code>asynctask</code> or something in your calling component.</p></li>\n<li><p>Utility classes are good members for injection (my opinion !!). Try using a DI library like Dagger to make your life easier if you end up using too many utility libraries.</p></li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":14722688,"reputation":494,"user_id":10632772,"display_name":"Asfar Hussain Siddiqui"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1584421956,"creation_date":1551523204,"answer_id":54957599,"question_id":42039471,"body_markdown":"**Network Availability check in android** \r\n\r\n    import android.content.Context;\r\n    import android.net.ConnectivityManager;\r\n    import android.net.NetworkInfo;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    public class NetworkUtil {\r\n        public static boolean isNetworkAvailable(Context context)\r\n        {\r\n            ConnectivityManager connectivityManager =(ConnectivityManager)context.getSystemService(Context.CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE);\r\n            NetworkInfo activeNetworkInfo = connectivityManager.getActiveNetworkInfo();\r\n            return activeNetworkInfo != null &amp;&amp;

I'm looking for some sort of framework or tool to manage/schedule the processing resources of single/multiple machines:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>(fair) scheduling of memory/CPU resources among REST API calls</li>\n<li>check for limitations (max open threads/max used memory) and when they are exceeded queue/pause new API calls (with timeouts) and resume paused calls when resources are available again.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In thread pools (of Java) we could only limit number of concurrent threads globally, so one REST call could reserve all these threads and other calls should wait for this call to be finished, also thread pools won't limit global use of memory.</p>\n<p>I'm familiar with Apache Spark, but it also crashes in case of unlimited requests and it's more of an ad-hoc/slow framework not suitable for interactive web applications. Is there any framework in Java or a tool (not required to be written in Java) to do this out of the box?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","relative-path","filenotfoundexception"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":195331,"reputation":275408,"user_id":438154,"accept_rate":98,"display_name":"Sotirios Delimanolis"},"score":0,"creation_date":1374502399,"post_id":17789727,"comment_id":25950820,"body_markdown":"The folder `data` does not seem to be on your classpath.

Start simple in each starter library start defining one `@Configuration` class with a `@ComponentScan(basePackages=“com.acme.libn)` when done release all the libriaries on the nexus (Note that this is a bad practice the starters should define the beans in the `@Configuration` classes but for this step will be used as a workaround). \r\n 2. Go on the consumers and remove `@ComponentScan`, update library and deploy. This will be the fastest way to remove the scanning of the beans on the main `com.acme` package.\r\n 3. Now you are free to work on each library as you prefer. Example: refactor the packages, declaring beans in the `@Configuration`, use `@ConditionalOn…`, remove `@ComponentScan`, use more `@Configuration` classes (you have to link them in the spring.factories file), start using prefix for using propeties defined in the consumers …, you can work in parallel on this task with your team. And release one library when it’s ready if you don’t want to release all of them together.\r\n 4. Re go in the consumers and refactor if needed, update the library that are ready and deploy. Go to step 3 till the libriaries are finished.\r\n\r\nOtherwise you have to refactor `com.acme` package in each library and in each consumers, keeping the `@ComponentScan` in the consumers. When done with all the libriaries you can then remove it. You don’t have to do it all together, you can do it one library at time and one consumer at time.\r\n\r\nPS: if you have entities and you are using spring-data in your libraries let me know I will update the answer because there is extra work to do.  \r\n\r\nI’ve read the documentation you have linked and I don’t know if it’s outdated or not. I’m using spring.factories file as for example stated [here](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-custom-starter).I’m using spring boot 2.7.0. So check the correct configuration for the version of spring boot you are using\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\nI&#39;ve read better the documentation and digged into the spring boot code `META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.import` can be used to tell spring where the `@Configuration\\@AutoCOnfiguration` classes are. You can also use `META-INF\\spring.factories` to declare the `@Configuration\\@AutoConfiguration` classes. In the source code they are using the first option. Honestly I&#39;ve not undersood the difference.\r\n\r\nI think I&#39;ve also discovered how to expose `@RestController` or any other component in a starter without using `@ComponentScan` as they say in the doc you must use `@Import` example:\r\n```\r\n@Configuration\r\n@Import({RestController.class, SomeService.class})\r\nclass ConfigurationClass {\r\n}\r\n@RestController\r\nclass RestController {\r\n}\r\n@Service\r\nclass SomeService {\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis will make the `SomeService` avaiable for injection, and I think this will expose automatically the endpoint defined in `RestController`, like spring-boot-starter-actuator.\r\n\r\nFor the repositories of spring-data-jpa you have to use this in the `ConfigurationClass` example:\r\n```\r\n@Configuration\r\n@AutoConfigureAfter(JpaRepositoriesAutoConfiguration.class)\r\n@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = &quot;com.example&quot;)\r\n@Import({Entity1.class, Entity2.class})\r\nclass ConfigurationClass {\r\n}\r\n@Entity\r\npublic class Entity1 {\r\n}\r\n@Entity\r\npublic class Entity2 {\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this way the repositories interfaces present in `com.example` will be ready for injection in the configuration class or outside the jar. In my project I was able to load entities only using `@EntityScan` in the consumer of the starter I have to make a try with @Import.\r\n\r\nAll the things that I&#39;ve writed in the **EDIT** section must be tested, the only exception is the configuration for jpa repositories with `@EntityScan` on the consumer. I&#39;ve had no time for test right now.\r\n\r\nSo in the end you can remove then `@ComponentScan` in the first step I&#39;ve writed and use `@Import`, but you have to list all the classes that are annotated like `@Component\\@Service...`. In this way you don&#39;t have to declare and construct all the beans of the step 3 in the configuration classes.\r\n\r\n**EDIT 2** I&#39;ve made some test you will find the code [here](https://github.com/paolopiccinini/spring-boot-starter-example)\r\nwhat i discovered:\r\n\r\n 1. Adding the configuration classes in `META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.import` doesn&#39;t work, you have to use `META-INF\\spring.factories` if you check the code I&#39;ve commented the configuration class in the file\r\n 2. `@Import` with entities doesn&#39;t work, unlikly you have to put `@EntityScan` in the cosnumer declaring all packages where the entities are.\r\n\r\nFor the rest everithing is fine. You can play with it:\r\n```\r\nPOST localhost:8080/someEntities\r\nrequest body\r\n{\r\n\t&quot;name&quot; : &quot;entity1&quot;        \r\n}\r\nresponse\r\n{\r\n    &quot;id&quot;: 1,\r\n    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;entity1&quot;\r\n}\r\n{\r\n    &quot;id&quot;: 1,\r\n    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;entity1&quot;\r\n}\r\nGET localhost:8080/someEntities/1\r\n{\r\n    &quot;id&quot;: 1,\r\n    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;entity1&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**EDIT 3** from spring boot v2.7 the classes annotated with `@AutoConfiguration` are migrated to a new file `META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports` (nothe the final s so imports) see this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73484864/spring-boot-custom-starter-org-springframework-boot-autoconfigure-autoconfigurat) for more info.

You just need to be prepared for the situation that this might stop working, so you need to prepare very well for this and really understand all the pros and cons. In the future someone will most likely need to somehow reimplement this functionality, so be clear that it is there, what&#39;s the purpose and how it works, what it should do and what it shouldn&#39;t. You can use automated tests for this. It is a bad practice, same like doing tracheotomy or chopping a limb of perfectly healthy person would be a crime, but when you do it to save the person life it isn&#39;t a crime, but legal operation, you might be even called hero for being brave and smart enough to do it. When there really wouldn&#39;t be better way, what would you do? Same applies here, that&#39;s life, just don&#39;t use it as an excuse to do bad things.\r\n\r\nFrom my personal diary, I have worked on very big project which nulled some private fields via reflection. I wasn&#39;t that experienced back then and I didn&#39;t even have idea that such thing may be &quot;implemented&quot; there. I was searching three full days for it and I wasn&#39;t the only one who tried to find the cause of the problem, we didn&#39;t even understand what was exactly happening, as at first the problem was reported as just missing some values, but it appeared that there&#39;s much more of things that were wrong there. Short story long, it ate 3 days of my life searching for it, there were no tests for it, nor anything, just such a creepy hidden flower in the code. Was this proper implementation? For me it was as bad as it only could. Of course later I needed to understand why it is there and how to reimplement and fix it. That just wasn&#39;t nice. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t like to use reflection like this, And to be honest I even don&#39;t like annotations, to me they are just spells someone put on code.

","title":"Is it safe to modify private variables using ReflectionUtils","body":"<p>Like with any other thing in the world, if you really know what you're doing, and there's no better way, then it could be ok to do it. You just need to be prepared for the situation that this might stop working, so you need to prepare very well for this and really understand all the pros and cons. In the future someone will most likely need to somehow reimplement this functionality, so be clear that it is there, what's the purpose and how it works, what it should do and what it shouldn't. You can use automated tests for this. It is a bad practice, same like doing tracheotomy or chopping a limb of perfectly healthy person would be a crime, but when you do it to save the person life it isn't a crime, but legal operation, you might be even called hero for being brave and smart enough to do it. When there really wouldn't be better way, what would you do? Same applies here, that's life, just don't use it as an excuse to do bad things.</p>\n<p>From my personal diary, I have worked on very big project which nulled some private fields via reflection. I wasn't that experienced back then and I didn't even have idea that such thing may be &quot;implemented&quot; there. I was searching three full days for it and I wasn't the only one who tried to find the cause of the problem, we didn't even understand what was exactly happening, as at first the problem was reported as just missing some values, but it appeared that there's much more of things that were wrong there. Short story long, it ate 3 days of my life searching for it, there were no tests for it, nor anything, just such a creepy hidden flower in the code. Was this proper implementation? For me it was as bad as it only could. Of course later I needed to understand why it is there and how to reimplement and fix it. That just wasn't nice. That's why I don't like to use reflection like this, And to be honest I even don't like annotations, to me they are just spells someone put on code.

In the sense that it is an effectively identical case as passing `this` around in a constructor.\r\n\r\nDuring the initialization of an object, there&#39;s a rather complex rigamarole that the runtime has to go through, considering that [A] the class itself must be available first (and this involves `static` initialization which is also quite complicated), [B] the constructor must run, but in order to do that, the invoked constructor of the parent must run first, and [C] constructor is not all, there&#39;s also the instance initializer block!\r\n\r\nWhenever you have a (non-static) field that is assigned a value, then there are only 2 options:\r\n\r\nA. That value is a compile time constant, such as `private int x = 5;`. There are very few constants - basically, the primitives, and strings.\r\n\r\nB. Anything else.\r\n\r\nConstants as per &#39;A&#39; are stored directly in the class file. But anything else cannot &#39;just&#39; be stored directly in the class file (the block that lists fields has room to state that its value must be initialized to a specific constant from the constant pool, but `System.currentTimeMillis()`, or `new Chapter(this)` is obviously not something you can stick in the constant pool). At the class file level, this is essentially just all moved into the constructor for you. An actual method is made with a funky name (`&lt;init&gt;`, which isn&#39;t a valid identifier so it cannot possibly clash with an actual method named `&lt;init&gt;`, as that wouldn&#39;t be valid java) and that is invoked. You can write initializers yourself, using an exotic bit of java syntax: Just toss braces straight in your class definition:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Test {\r\n  public Test() {\r\n    hello(30);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  int foo = 5; // constant\r\n  int bar = hello(10);\r\n  { System.out.println(&quot;Instance initializer&quot;); }\r\n  int baz = hello(20);\r\n\r\n  static int hello(int in) {\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Hello: &quot; + in);\r\n    return in;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) { new Test(); }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can compile and run the above and you get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHello: 10\r\nInstance initializer\r\nHello: 20\r\nHello: 30\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich shows you exactly how this works: All &#39;instance initializations&#39; are run in &#39;lexical order&#39; (in the order they appear in your source file), and there is no difference between `private int bar = hello(10);` and ` {hello(20);}` - these are both instance initializers.\r\n\r\nThe problem with yelling &#39;bad practice!!!!&#39; is that programming __is just too difficult for that sort of rote application of rules__. If it was that simple we&#39;d just let the computers program themselves.\r\n\r\nNo, strict adherence to a list of bad practices just means you end up with even crappier code. You can&#39;t &quot;rule of thumb&quot; your way to clean code (&#39;clean&#39; defined as: Easy to read (which in turn means: You quickly come to an initial impression about what the code does when glancing at it, and this initial impression is not misleading), easy to test, flexible (defined as: When expectable change requests come in it is not particularly hard to process these and does not require many changes to code that interacts with this code, i.e. few to no API changes for example)).\r\n\r\nSo, you must first understand __why__ &#39;it is bad practice&#39; to pass `this` around in constructors. Failure to understand why means the rule is useless to you.\r\n\r\nThe reason why is - you&#39;re halfway through initialization and variables may not have a value yet. Let&#39;s see it in action!\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Test {\r\n  final int bar = hello(this, 10);\r\n  final int baz = hello(this, 20);\r\n  final int foo = hello(this, 30);\r\n\r\n  public static int hello(Test t, int v) {\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;BAZ: &quot; + t.baz);\r\n    return v;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    new Test();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning this prints:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBAZ: 0\r\nBAZ: 0\r\nBAZ: 20\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is __utterly, off the wall, nuts__. How in the blazes is a `final` variable, no less, changing value!!?!!!\r\n\r\nAnd that&#39;s the biggest reason why this is a very bad idea. There are quite a few more, but this one is easy to understand and sufficient to show why you should never be doing this. This act generally falls under the &#39;incredibly confusing hackery&#39; category. Which means if you must resort to such a thing, you must add a ton of comments about why, and what&#39;s going to happen, and precisely which pre- and post conditions you expect. Generally however much time you spend on writing and maintaining those comments (and remember, maintaining comments is really difficult, because you cannot unit test them!), surely that&#39;s not worth whatever shortcut you think you are achieving with doing this. But, hey, if truly it _is_ worth it, then by all means. Hack away. Don&#39;t forget those comments.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE FOR THE READER: If you want to learn more, I suggest you write a more extensive example which also involves static initializers (non-constant expressions that initialize static fields, as well as `static { codeGoesHere(); }`, just like that in a `class` definition, e.g. `class Foo { static { System.out.println(&quot;HELLO!&quot;); }}`), and a hierarchy of types. For bonus points, have the constructor of the parent type invoke a method that isn&#39;t final, and then override that method in your subclass and have that method interact with fields. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Parent {\r\n  Parent() {\r\n    System.out.println(thisIsWeird());\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  String thisIsWeird() {\r\n    return &quot;Parent&quot;;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Child extends Parent {\r\n  private final String field = &quot;Simple&quot;.toLowerCase();\r\n\r\n  @Override String thisIsWeird() {\r\n    return field;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run it, and start drawing conclusions (and then prepare to forget all these nitty gritty details and remember only the upshot, which is: Don&#39;t do this crazy stuff, it&#39;s not worth it).\r\n","title":"Passing &quot;this&quot; to private final members in Java","body":"<p>Yes, bad practice.
