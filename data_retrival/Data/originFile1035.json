And for real world applications, look at frameworks like netty :)"},{"owner":{"account_id":11012431,"reputation":1620,"user_id":8089312,"display_name":"Osca"},"score":0,"creation_date":1663203545,"post_id":73724280,"comment_id":130186234,"body_markdown":"@zapl thanks. sounds like I need to work on server first","body":"@zapl thanks. sounds like I need to work on server first"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":11012431,"reputation":1620,"user_id":8089312,"display_name":"Osca"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1663213417,"creation_date":1663213417,"answer_id":73725403,"question_id":73724280,"body_markdown":"I looped the client 20 times and opened 5 terminals.\r\n```\r\nimport java.io.*;\r\nimport java.net.*;\r\npublic class MyClient{\r\n    public static void main(String[]args) throws IOException{\r\n     System.out.println(args[0]);\r\n     System.out.println(args[1]);\r\n     int cnt = 0;\r\n     while(cnt&lt;20) {\r\n     Socket socket = new Socket(args[0], Integer.parseInt(args[1]));\r\n\r\n     BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\r\n     String message;\r\n\r\n     while((message = in.readLine()) != null)\r\n     {\r\n         System.out.println(message);\r\n         System.out.println(cnt);\r\n     }\r\n     socket.close();\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```","title":"Loop the client for sending multiple requests to the server until reaching the max","body":"<p>I looped the client 20 times and opened 5 terminals.</p>\n<pre><code>import java.io.*;\nimport java.net.*;\npublic class MyClient{\n    public static void main(String[]args) throws IOException{\n     System.out.println(args[0]);\n     System.out.println(args[1]);\n     int cnt = 0;\n     while(cnt&lt;20) {\n     Socket socket = new Socket(args[0], Integer.parseInt(args[1]));\n\n     BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));\n     String message;\n\n     while((message = in.readLine()) != null)\n     {\n         System.out.println(message);\n         System.out.println(cnt);\n     }\n     socket.close();\n     }\n   }\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":11012431,"reputation":1620,"user_id":8089312,"display_name":"Osca"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":118,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1663213417,"creation_date":1663199937,"question_id":73724280,"body_markdown":"My client can send a single request to the server.

The documentation can be found [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html). A runnable is an object that has a `run` method. When you start a thread, it will call whatever code is in the `run` method of this runnable object. For example:\r\n\r\n    Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable() {\r\n             @Override\r\n             public void run() {\r\n                  // Insert some method call here.\r\n             }\r\n    });\r\n\r\nNow, what this means is when you call `t.start()`, it will run whatever code you need it to without lagging the main thread.

Since the area depends on the content and different tabs will likely have different title lengths, then there has to be a policy about how to render those tabs. The criteria was to center tabs content and fit the tab area to this content. When we have a default tabbed pane with tabs placed at the top, we don&#39;t care much about icon/text alignment:\r\n\r\n![top_tabbed_pane][1]\r\n\r\nThe only concern could be tabs having different length, but who cares? After all, icons and text are visible and tabbed pane looks good enough. However, when you set the tabs placement to *LEFT* or *RIGHT* things are different and it looks unappealing:\r\n\r\n![left_tabbed_pane][2]\r\n\r\nApparently this default behavior is a long standing problem, and there&#39;s a really interesting discussion [here][ora]. Some SO members are involved there: @camickr, @kleopatra, @splungebob. As discussed in that post, a simple solution is not possible, and several workarounds were proposed: basically a custom UI implementation or using panels as renderers and playing with preferred width/height based on text length. Both alternatives involve quite a lot of work.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid dealing with UI delegates and taking advantage of `setTabComponentAt(...)` method, I&#39;ve started some time ago a tabbed pane extension that I&#39;d like to share here. The approach is based on Swing concept of renderer: a class that has to generate a component to render another component&#39;s part, and the goal is to provide a flexible mechanism to add custom tab components.\r\n\r\nI have included an example below using my custom tabbed pane and here is an overview of all interfaces/classes needed to provide the aforementioned mechanism.\r\n\r\n### ITabRenderer interface ###\r\n\r\nThe first step is to define an iterface to offer a contract to render a tab component.\r\n\r\n### AbstractTabRenderer class ###\r\n\r\nAn abstract class to provide base methods to help in the `getTabRendererComponent(...)` method implementation. This abstract class has three main properties:\r\n\r\n - `prototypeText`: used to define a prototype text to generate a default renderer component.\r\n - `prototypeIcon`: used to define a prototype icon to generate a default renderer.\r\n - `horizontalTextAlignment`: tab&#39;s text horizontal alignment.\r\n\r\nNote this class is abstract because it doesn&#39;t implement `getTabRendererComponent(...)` method.\r\n\r\n### DefaultTabRenderer class ###\r\n\r\nA concrete implementation by extending `AbstractTabRenderer` class.

Since the area depends on the content and different tabs will likely have different title lengths, then there has to be a policy about how to render those tabs. The criteria was to center tabs content and fit the tab area to this content. When we have a default tabbed pane with tabs placed at the top, we don't care much about icon/text alignment:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qPV8r.jpg\" alt=\"top_tabbed_pane\"></p>\n\n<p>The only concern could be tabs having different length, but who cares? After all, icons and text are visible and tabbed pane looks good enough. However, when you set the tabs placement to <em>LEFT</em> or <em>RIGHT</em> things are different and it looks unappealing:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/prtMz.jpg\" alt=\"left_tabbed_pane\"></p>\n\n<p>Apparently this default behavior is a long standing problem, and there's a really interesting discussion <a href=\"https://community.oracle.com/thread/1556158\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. Some SO members are involved there: @camickr, @kleopatra, @splungebob. As discussed in that post, a simple solution is not possible, and several workarounds were proposed: basically a custom UI implementation or using panels as renderers and playing with preferred width/height based on text length. Both alternatives involve quite a lot of work.</p>\n\n<p>In order to avoid dealing with UI delegates and taking advantage of <code>setTabComponentAt(...)</code> method, I've started some time ago a tabbed pane extension that I'd like to share here. The approach is based on Swing concept of renderer: a class that has to generate a component to render another component's part, and the goal is to provide a flexible mechanism to add custom tab components.</p>\n\n<p>I have included an example below using my custom tabbed pane and here is an overview of all interfaces/classes needed to provide the aforementioned mechanism.</p>\n\n<h3>ITabRenderer interface</h3>\n\n<p>The first step is to define an iterface to offer a contract to render a tab component.</p>\n\n<h3>AbstractTabRenderer class</h3>\n\n<p>An abstract class to provide base methods to help in the <code>getTabRendererComponent(...)</code> method implementation. This abstract class has three main properties:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>prototypeText</code>: used to define a prototype text to generate a default renderer component.</li>\n<li><code>prototypeIcon</code>: used to define a prototype icon to generate a default renderer.</li>\n<li><code>horizontalTextAlignment</code>: tab's text horizontal alignment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note this class is abstract because it doesn't implement <code>getTabRendererComponent(...)</code> method.</p>\n\n<h3>DefaultTabRenderer class</h3>\n\n<p>A concrete implementation by extending <code>AbstractTabRenderer</code> class.
