I&#39;ll address them in order.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### What&#39;s going on\r\n\r\nYour final observations about `fireAllRules` are explaining what&#39;s going on.\r\n\r\nIf you pass a number to `fireAllRules`, it will stop after firing that many rules. If you don&#39;t give it a number, it will evaluate all rules. \r\n\r\nThe reason you&#39;re getting different results is because your input is such that you&#39;re triggering multiple rules. \r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example. If you `fireAllRules()` with this input:\r\n```\r\nDiscount{\r\n  taskName: &quot;Discount&quot;,\r\n  country: &quot;IN&quot;,\r\n  oldProductGroup: &quot;Cadbury&quot;,\r\n  oldProductType: &quot;New&quot;\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will trigger rule 1 and the last one in the screenshot (looks like rule 8).\r\n\r\nIt triggers rule 1, because that rule will trigger for all Discount inputs with task name &quot;Discount&quot; and country &quot;IN&quot;. It has no other requirements.\r\n\r\nIt triggers rule 8, because it meets the task name, country, old product group, and old product type conditions.\r\n\r\n(The other rules in between might fire too -- I didn&#39;t show what the other fields are set to. You can actually get most of your tables to trigger if you set oldSupplier = &quot;ABC&quot; and urgency = &quot;High&quot;.)\r\n\r\nWhat will actually be returned by `fireAllRules` will be the _last_ rule to match. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Doing what you want it to\r\n\r\nYou say your requirements are to &quot;include the blank cells in the rule&quot;. Drools doesn&#39;t do that. What you need to do is design your rules so that those blank cells are not actually blank but interpreted correctly. In your example, how are we supposed to differentiate the meaning of a blank between &quot;any value can be in this slot&quot; versus &quot;this slot must not have a value (null)&quot; versus &quot;this slot must be a blank string&quot;? Drools interprets an empty cell as there being no condition relating to that field, so it basically ignores that field or condition.\r\n\r\nIf you reorder your rules to have the most-specific rules first, you might be able to get away with just calling `fireAllRules(1)` which will return after the first match.

I'll address them in order.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>What's going on</h3>\n<p>Your final observations about <code>fireAllRules</code> are explaining what's going on.</p>\n<p>If you pass a number to <code>fireAllRules</code>, it will stop after firing that many rules. If you don't give it a number, it will evaluate all rules.</p>\n<p>The reason you're getting different results is because your input is such that you're triggering multiple rules.</p>\n<p>Here's an example. If you <code>fireAllRules()</code> with this input:</p>\n<pre><code>Discount{\n  taskName: &quot;Discount&quot;,\n  country: &quot;IN&quot;,\n  oldProductGroup: &quot;Cadbury&quot;,\n  oldProductType: &quot;New&quot;\n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>You will trigger rule 1 and the last one in the screenshot (looks like rule 8).</p>\n<p>It triggers rule 1, because that rule will trigger for all Discount inputs with task name &quot;Discount&quot; and country &quot;IN&quot;. It has no other requirements.</p>\n<p>It triggers rule 8, because it meets the task name, country, old product group, and old product type conditions.</p>\n<p>(The other rules in between might fire too -- I didn't show what the other fields are set to. You can actually get most of your tables to trigger if you set oldSupplier = &quot;ABC&quot; and urgency = &quot;High&quot;.)</p>\n<p>What will actually be returned by <code>fireAllRules</code> will be the <em>last</em> rule to match.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Doing what you want it to</h3>\n<p>You say your requirements are to &quot;include the blank cells in the rule&quot;. Drools doesn't do that. What you need to do is design your rules so that those blank cells are not actually blank but interpreted correctly. In your example, how are we supposed to differentiate the meaning of a blank between &quot;any value can be in this slot&quot; versus &quot;this slot must not have a value (null)&quot; versus &quot;this slot must be a blank string&quot;? Drools interprets an empty cell as there being no condition relating to that field, so it basically ignores that field or condition.</p>\n<p>If you reorder your rules to have the most-specific rules first, you might be able to get away with just calling <code>fireAllRules(1)</code> which will return after the first match. This will likely get a bit hairy if you have lots of empty conditions.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, you can add null check columns. Using 'dummy' column as an example:</p>\n<pre><code>| CONDITION   | CONDITION     |\n| mappingObject: Discount     |\n| dummy == $1 | dummy == null |\n| DUMMY       | DUMMY NOT SET |\n| foo         |               |\n|             | X             |\n</code></pre>\n<p>First column &quot;DUMMY&quot; works like your current spreadsheet column. Populate it if you want to match some value in this field.</p>\n<p>Second column &quot;DUMMY NOT SET&quot; works like your requirements want -- it explicitly checks that the value is <em>not set</em>. You just need to stick a value in this field (doesn't matter what the value is) to get the condition to be added to the rule.</p>\n<p>So for every one of your columns, add a second 'NOT SET' column, and then the fields you want to additionally do a null check for in the rule you need to populate those columns.</p>\n<p>It's gross.

I know this is because the webdriver is searching the entire page for the element, but still... any faster ways?</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible to somehow use WebDriverWait with a very low timeout?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","sql","postgresql","liquibase"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3572516,"reputation":141,"user_id":2982506,"display_name":"Dmitry Shabalin"},"score":0,"creation_date":1682019819,"post_id":76067385,"comment_id":134154224,"body_markdown":"99% migrations are fast and i dont what add extra hand work to manipulate by 1% sql queries.","body":"99% migrations are fast and i dont what add extra hand work to manipulate by 1% sql queries."}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":27960048,"reputation":151,"user_id":21352044,"display_name":"PJatLiquibase"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1682020337,"creation_date":1682020337,"answer_id":76067781,"question_id":76067385,"body_markdown":"I do include these type of statements in my Liquibase changelogs whenever I want to ensure that an update is propagating across all my environments.

I am sending an object that has two lists (in my case, synchronized `ArrayLists`) from a server to a client. One is a list of users connected to the server, and the other is a list of lobbies that exist on the server. Every lobby also has its own list of users that are connected to it. After creating the object that encapsulates all of these lists and their data on the server side, I walk through the user list and print out each user&#39;s username as well as the ID of the lobby they are currently in. I then send the object using an `ObjectOutputStream` over a socket.\r\n\r\nOn the client side I receive the object using an `ObjectInputStream`, cast it to my encapsulating object type, and then again walk through the user list, printing out each user&#39;s username and the ID of the lobby that they are in.\r\n\r\nHere is where my problem occurs. Every user&#39;s username (and other data) is printed correctly, except the ID of the lobby that they are in. This is somehow null, even though the printing on the server side printed the IDs correctly.\r\n\r\nUsernames are `String`s, IDs are `UUID`s, and users and lobbies each have their own respective class that I created.\r\n\r\nI originally thought this could be some issue with passing by reference vs by value, or an issue with `UUID`s, but even after changing IDs to be just a normal int, this still happens.\r\n\r\nI then thought it could be my list structure. At the time I was using a `ConcurrentHashMap` to store users and lobbies. I changed it to a synchronized list, but the same thing kept happening.\r\n\r\nNote that when a new user connects, they receive a correct copy of the lists. But any lobbies that they or others join/leave are again not reflected correctly. Everything on the server side tracks and prints correctly though.\r\n\r\nThis is a relatively big project for me, and everything is rather connected, so I am unsure what code examples or output I should include.

I am sending an object that has two lists (in my case, synchronized <code>ArrayLists</code>) from a server to a client. One is a list of users connected to the server, and the other is a list of lobbies that exist on the server. Every lobby also has its own list of users that are connected to it. After creating the object that encapsulates all of these lists and their data on the server side, I walk through the user list and print out each user's username as well as the ID of the lobby they are currently in. I then send the object using an <code>ObjectOutputStream</code> over a socket.</p>\n<p>On the client side I receive the object using an <code>ObjectInputStream</code>, cast it to my encapsulating object type, and then again walk through the user list, printing out each user's username and the ID of the lobby that they are in.</p>\n<p>Here is where my problem occurs. Every user's username (and other data) is printed correctly, except the ID of the lobby that they are in. This is somehow null, even though the printing on the server side printed the IDs correctly.</p>\n<p>Usernames are <code>String</code>s, IDs are <code>UUID</code>s, and users and lobbies each have their own respective class that I created.</p>\n<p>I originally thought this could be some issue with passing by reference vs by value, or an issue with <code>UUID</code>s, but even after changing IDs to be just a normal int, this still happens.</p>\n<p>I then thought it could be my list structure. At the time I was using a <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> to store users and lobbies. I changed it to a synchronized list, but the same thing kept happening.</p>\n<p>Note that when a new user connects, they receive a correct copy of the lists. But any lobbies that they or others join/leave are again not reflected correctly. Everything on the server side tracks and prints correctly though.</p>\n<p>This is a relatively big project for me, and everything is rather connected, so I am unsure what code examples or output I should include. Please feel free to suggest anything that should be included/specified in my question, and I will add it.
