The moving head supports 16bit and this troubles me. I know that the 16bit comes from using two “channels”. 1 channel is one byte, 8 bits, so the maximum value for 1 channel is 255. When using two channels the maximum increases to 65.356 which will give much more precise movement on the pan- &amp; tilt-channel. So, a 16bit moving head uses 4 channels for controlling pan and tilt.\r\n\r\nNow I want to create a simple movement generator in Java. Simple looping the pan- and tilt-value from 1 to 255. If I understand it correct, when using 16bit moving head, it means, first setting the pan “fine” (pan only in this example) from 1 to 255 and when pan “fine” reaches 255 then increasing pan “course” with 1, like this:\r\nPan “fine” 1-&gt;255, when reaching 255 increase pan course with 1 then again Pan “fine” 1-&gt;255, when reaching 255 increase pan course with 1 and then again Pan “fine” 1-&gt;255, when reaching 255 increase pan course with 1, and so on.\r\n\r\nI need to have some kind of delay in the movement generator and I can see on various places that it is best to avoid Thread.sleep() (and while loops) as it can drift, so I have decided to built the generator in its own method and then call this method with an Executor Service (scheduleAtFixedRate), like this:\r\n\r\n    import java.util.concurrent.Executors;\r\n    import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService;\r\n    import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;\r\n    \r\n    public class Main {\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    \r\n            test test = new test();\r\n    \r\n            ScheduledExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();\r\n    \r\n            executorService.scheduleAtFixedRate(test::run, 0, 10000000, TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS);\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n“run” is the method with the generator and “test” is the class containing the method.

What do you guys suggest trying?</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class StarClass \nimplements Icon {\n    static JFrame frame;\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n    JFrame frame = new JFrame();\n\n    frame.setSize(400, 400);\n    frame.setTitle(\"My Star\");\n    frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n    frame.setVisible(true);\n    }\n\n\n    @Override\n    public void paintIcon(Component c, Graphics g, int x, int y) {\n\n    Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g;\n\n    //points\n    Point2D.Double pt1 \n        = new Point2D.Double(100, 10);\n    Point2D.Double pt2 \n        = new Point2D.Double(125, 75);\n    Point2D.Double pt3 \n        = new Point2D.Double(200, 85);\n    Point2D.Double pt4 \n        = new Point2D.Double(150, 125);\n    Point2D.Double pt5 \n        = new Point2D.Double(160, 190);\n    Point2D.Double pt6 \n        = new Point2D.Double(100, 150);\n    Point2D.Double pt7 \n        = new Point2D.Double(40, 190);\n    Point2D.Double pt8 \n        = new Point2D.Double(50, 125);\n    Point2D.Double pt9 \n        = new Point2D.Double(0, 85);\n\n    //lines\n    Line2D.Double ln1 \n        = new Line2D.Double(pt1, pt2);\n    Line2D.Double ln2 \n        = new Line2D.Double(pt2, pt3);\n    Line2D.Double ln3 \n        = new Line2D.Double(pt3, pt4);\n    Line2D.Double ln4 \n        = new Line2D.Double(pt4, pt5);\n    Line2D.Double ln5 \n        = new Line2D.Double(pt5, pt6);\n    Line2D.Double ln6 \n        = new Line2D.Double(pt6, pt7);\n    Line2D.Double ln7 \n        = new Line2D.Double(pt7, pt8);\n    Line2D.Double ln8 \n        = new Line2D.Double(pt8, pt9);\n\n    //color of lines\n    g2.setColor(Color.BLUE);\n\n    //draw the lines\n    g2.draw(ln1);\n    g2.draw(ln2);\n    g2.draw(ln3);\n    g2.draw(ln4);\n    g2.draw(ln5);\n    g2.draw(ln6);\n    g2.draw(ln7);\n    g2.draw(ln8);\n\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getIconWidth() {\n        return 200;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getIconHeight() {\n        return 200;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","maven","dependency-management"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":888714,"reputation":34077,"user_id":927493,"accept_rate":61,"display_name":"J Fabian Meier"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1675532955,"creation_date":1675532955,"answer_id":75347121,"question_id":75347085,"body_markdown":"From your error message, the problem is\r\n\r\n````\r\nstatus: 401 Unauthorized\r\n````\r\n\r\nwhich means that you have probably not set the credentials for contacting github correctly.","title":"Why maven trying to find springboot dependencies in my remote repository And How I change it?","body":"<p>From your error message, the problem is</p>\n<pre><code>status: 401 Unauthorized\n</code></pre>\n<p>which means that you have probably not set the credentials for contacting github correctly.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":8283204,"reputation":11,"user_id":6227188,"display_name":"Burak Balım"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1675534773,"creation_date":1675534773,"answer_id":75347320,"question_id":75347085,"body_markdown":"you should edit settings.xml(username, password, repository url) in your /.m2 directory\r\n\r\n    /Users/username/.m2/","title":"Why maven trying to find springboot dependencies in my remote repository And How I change it?","body":"<p>you should edit settings.xml(username, password, repository url) in your /.m2 directory</p>\n<pre><code>/Users/username/.m2/\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":19803382,"reputation":31,"user_id":14503828,"display_name":"ifsygn"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1675536531,"creation_date":1675536416,"answer_id":75347493,"question_id":75347085,"body_markdown":"After trying many solutions, I solved the problem in a very strange way.

The original code doesn&#39;t seem too bad, and indeed it seems rather better than some of the answers that have been proposed. However, the statement lambdas and the local variables of type `Optional` do seem to add a fair amount of clutter.\r\n\r\nFirst, I&#39;ll take the liberty of modifying the original code by wrapping it in a method, giving the parameters nice names, and making up some type names. I have no idea if the actual code is like this, but this shouldn&#39;t really be surprising to anyone.\r\n\r\n    // original version, slightly modified\r\n    void inviteById(UserId targetId, UserId sourceId, EventId eventId) {\r\n        Optional&lt;User&gt; maybeTarget = userRepository.findById(targetId);\r\n        Optional&lt;String&gt; maybeSourceName = userRepository.findById(sourceId).map(User::getName);\r\n        Optional&lt;String&gt; maybeEventName = eventRepository.findById(eventId).map(Event::getName);\r\n\r\n        maybeTarget.ifPresent(target -&gt; {\r\n            maybeSourceName.ifPresent(sourceName -&gt; {\r\n                maybeEventName.ifPresent(eventName -&gt; {\r\n                    sendInvite(target.getEmail(), String.format(&quot;Hi %s, %s has invited you to %s&quot;,\r\n                                                      target.getName(), sourceName, eventName));\r\n                });\r\n            });\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI played around with different refactorings, and I found that extracting the inner statement lambda into its own method makes the most sense to me. Given source and target users and an event -- no Optional stuff -- it sends mail about it. This is the computation that needs to be performed after all the optional stuff has been dealt with. I&#39;ve also moved the data extraction (email, name) in here instead of mixing it with the Optional processing in the outer layer. Again, this makes sense to me: send mail from *source* to *target* about *event*.\r\n\r\n    void setupInvite(User target, User source, Event event) {\r\n        sendInvite(target.getEmail(), String.format(&quot;Hi %s, %s has invited you to %s&quot;,\r\n                   target.getName(), source.getName(), event.getName()));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow, let&#39;s deal with the optional stuff. As I said above, `ifPresent` is the way to go here, since we want to do something with side effects. It also provides a way to &quot;extract&quot; the value from an Optional and bind it to a name, but only within the context of a lambda expression. Since we want to do this for three different Optionals, nesting is called for. Nesting allows names from outer lambdas to be captured by inner lambdas. This lets us bind names to values extracted from the Optionals -- but only if they&#39;re present. This can&#39;t really be done with a linear chain, since some intermediate data structure like a tuple would be necessary to build up the partial results.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the innermost lambda, we call the helper method defined above.\r\n\r\n    void inviteById(UserId targetId, UserId sourceID, EventId eventId) {\r\n        userRepository.findById(targetId).ifPresent(\r\n            target -&gt; userRepository.findById(sourceID).ifPresent(\r\n                source -&gt; eventRepository.findById(eventId).ifPresent(\r\n                    event -&gt; setupInvite(target, source, event))));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote that I&#39;ve inlined the Optionals instead of holding them in local variables. This reveals the nesting structure a bit better. It also provides for &quot;short-circuiting&quot; of the operation if one of the lookups doesn&#39;t find anything, since `ifPresent` simply does nothing on an empty Optional.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s still a bit dense to my eye, though. I think the reason is that this code still depends on some external repositories on which to do the lookups. It&#39;s a bit uncomfortable to have this mixed together with the Optional processing. A possibility is simply to extract the lookups into their own methods `findUser` and `findEvent`. These are pretty obvious so I won&#39;t write them out. But if this were done, the result would be:\r\n\r\n    void inviteById(UserId targetId, UserId sourceID, EventId eventId) {\r\n        findUser(targetId).ifPresent(\r\n            target -&gt; findUser(sourceID).ifPresent(\r\n                source -&gt; findEvent(eventId).ifPresent(\r\n                    event -&gt; setupInvite(target, source, event))));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFundamentally, this isn&#39;t that different from the original code. It&#39;s subjective, but I think I prefer this to the original code. It has the same, fairly simple structure, although nested instead of the typical linear chain of Optional processing. What&#39;s different is that the lookups are done conditionally within Optional processing, instead of being done up front, stored in local variables, and then doing only conditional extraction of Optional values.

This avoids mixing data manipulation with Optional processing, which I think tends to confuse things if we&#39;re dealing with multiple Optional instances.","title":"How to use Java 8 Optionals, performing an action if all three are present?","body":"<p>Since the original code is being executed for its side effects (sending an email), and not extracting or generating a value, the nested <code>ifPresent</code> calls seem appropriate. The original code doesn't seem too bad, and indeed it seems rather better than some of the answers that have been proposed. However, the statement lambdas and the local variables of type <code>Optional</code> do seem to add a fair amount of clutter.</p>\n\n<p>First, I'll take the liberty of modifying the original code by wrapping it in a method, giving the parameters nice names, and making up some type names. I have no idea if the actual code is like this, but this shouldn't really be surprising to anyone.</p>\n\n<pre><code>// original version, slightly modified\nvoid inviteById(UserId targetId, UserId sourceId, EventId eventId) {\n    Optional&lt;User&gt; maybeTarget = userRepository.findById(targetId);\n    Optional&lt;String&gt; maybeSourceName = userRepository.findById(sourceId).map(User::getName);\n    Optional&lt;String&gt; maybeEventName = eventRepository.findById(eventId).map(Event::getName);\n\n    maybeTarget.ifPresent(target -&gt; {\n        maybeSourceName.ifPresent(sourceName -&gt; {\n            maybeEventName.ifPresent(eventName -&gt; {\n                sendInvite(target.getEmail(), String.format(\"Hi %s, %s has invited you to %s\",\n                                                  target.getName(), sourceName, eventName));\n            });\n        });\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I played around with different refactorings, and I found that extracting the inner statement lambda into its own method makes the most sense to me. Given source and target users and an event -- no Optional stuff -- it sends mail about it. This is the computation that needs to be performed after all the optional stuff has been dealt with. I've also moved the data extraction (email, name) in here instead of mixing it with the Optional processing in the outer layer. Again, this makes sense to me: send mail from <em>source</em> to <em>target</em> about <em>event</em>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>void setupInvite(User target, User source, Event event) {\n    sendInvite(target.getEmail(), String.format(\"Hi %s, %s has invited you to %s\",\n               target.getName(), source.getName(), event.getName()));\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, let's deal with the optional stuff. As I said above, <code>ifPresent</code> is the way to go here, since we want to do something with side effects. It also provides a way to \"extract\" the value from an Optional and bind it to a name, but only within the context of a lambda expression. Since we want to do this for three different Optionals, nesting is called for. Nesting allows names from outer lambdas to be captured by inner lambdas. This lets us bind names to values extracted from the Optionals -- but only if they're present. This can't really be done with a linear chain, since some intermediate data structure like a tuple would be necessary to build up the partial results.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, in the innermost lambda, we call the helper method defined above.</p>\n\n<pre><code>void inviteById(UserId targetId, UserId sourceID, EventId eventId) {\n    userRepository.findById(targetId).ifPresent(\n        target -&gt; userRepository.findById(sourceID).ifPresent(\n            source -&gt; eventRepository.findById(eventId).ifPresent(\n                event -&gt; setupInvite(target, source, event))));\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that I've inlined the Optionals instead of holding them in local variables. This reveals the nesting structure a bit better. It also provides for \"short-circuiting\" of the operation if one of the lookups doesn't find anything, since <code>ifPresent</code> simply does nothing on an empty Optional.</p>\n\n<p>It's still a bit dense to my eye, though. I think the reason is that this code still depends on some external repositories on which to do the lookups. It's a bit uncomfortable to have this mixed together with the Optional processing. A possibility is simply to extract the lookups into their own methods <code>findUser</code> and <code>findEvent</code>. These are pretty obvious so I won't write them out. But if this were done, the result would be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void inviteById(UserId targetId, UserId sourceID, EventId eventId) {\n    findUser(targetId).ifPresent(\n        target -&gt; findUser(sourceID).ifPresent(\n            source -&gt; findEvent(eventId).ifPresent(\n                event -&gt; setupInvite(target, source, event))));\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Fundamentally, this isn't that different from the original code. It's subjective, but I think I prefer this to the original code. It has the same, fairly simple structure, although nested instead of the typical linear chain of Optional processing. What's different is that the lookups are done conditionally within Optional processing, instead of being done up front, stored in local variables, and then doing only conditional extraction of Optional values. Also, I've separated out data manipulation (extraction of email and name, sending of message) into a separate method. This avoids mixing data manipulation with Optional processing, which I think tends to confuse things if we're dealing with multiple Optional instances.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3730318,"reputation":4896,"user_id":3102935,"accept_rate":95,"display_name":"WorldSEnder"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":10,"is_accepted":false,"score":9,"last_activity_date":1516943184,"creation_date":1516935164,"answer_id":48455157,"question_id":48446622,"body_markdown":"You can use the following if you want to stick to `Optional` and not commit to consuming the value immediately.

Project B still requires a properties file to point to Project A now, <strong>how do i solve this?</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>I have a parent module POM in the root folder containing all these projects, over which this maven jandex dependency is distributed to all modules, so it looks like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Maven parent module (contains all dependencies and versions used by all project sub modules)</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Project A</strong> (custom local maven library repo), own pom.xml with inheritance from parent module</li>\n<li><strong>Project B</strong> (custom local maven library repo, includes Project A library), own pom.xml with inheritance from parent module\n<ul>\n<li><em>application.properties</em> - Indexes Project A dependency manually, <strong>this is the problematic one which needs to go!</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Project C</strong> (Local maven project for REST API etc., includes Project B library), own pom.xml with inheritance from parent module</li>\n</ol>\n<p>pom.xml (parent module POM, containing maven jandex dependepency among others)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Edit: One of the projects, &quot;entity&quot;, where all the database access objects are stored, does not run the jandex plugin during <code>mvn clean install</code>.

For instance, you can do so within your custom filter constructor, by using something like that:</p>\n<pre><code>super.setRequiresAuthenticationRequestMatcher(new AntPathRequestMatcher(&quot;/auth/signin&quot;, &quot;GET&quot;));\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1833467,"reputation":7501,"user_id":1664315,"accept_rate":59,"display_name":"Arian"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":2748,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"answer_count":3,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1675525879,"creation_date":1495098469,"question_id":44043348,"body_markdown":"I have the following `filter` definition: \r\n\r\n    @Component\r\n    public class JWTAuthenticationFilter extends AbstractAuthenticationProcessingFilter {\r\n    \t\r\n    \t@Autowired\r\n    \tprivate UserDetailsService customUserDetailsService;\r\n    \t@Autowired\r\n    \tprivate AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;\r\n    \t\r\n        private static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(JWTAuthenticationFilter.class);\r\n        private final static UrlPathHelper urlPathHelper = new UrlPathHelper();\r\n    \t\r\n        \r\n    \tpublic JWTAuthenticationFilter() {\r\n    \t\tsuper(&quot;/**&quot;); // what should I pass here ? \r\n    \t\tsetAuthenticationManager(new NoOpAuthenticationManager());\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \t@Override\r\n        public Authentication attemptAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws AuthenticationException, IOException, ServletException {\r\n    \t\tAuthentication authentication = AuthenticationService.getAuthentication((HttpServletRequest) request, customUserDetailsService);\r\n            return authentication;\r\n        }\r\n    \t\r\n    \t@Override\r\n    \tpublic void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain) throws IOException, ServletException {\r\n    \t\tfilterChain.doFilter(request, response);\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \t@Override\r\n    \tprotected void successfulAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response,FilterChain chain, Authentication authentication) throws IOException, ServletException {\r\n            super.successfulAuthentication(request, response, chain, authentication);\r\n    \t\tlogger.debug(&quot;successful authentication while attempting to access &quot; + urlPathHelper.getPathWithinApplication((HttpServletRequest) request));\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \t@Override\r\n    \tprotected void unsuccessfulAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request,\r\n    \t\t\tHttpServletResponse response, AuthenticationException failed)\r\n    \t\t\tthrows IOException, ServletException {\r\n    \t\tlogger.debug(&quot;failed authentication while attempting to access &quot; + urlPathHelper.getPathWithinApplication((HttpServletRequest) request));\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand the following two `configure` methods in web configuration for my Spring security: \r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\r\n    \thttp\r\n    \t\t.sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS)\r\n    \t\t.and()\r\n    \t\t.csrf().disable()\r\n    \t\t.authorizeRequests()\r\n    \t\t\t.anyRequest().authenticated()\r\n    \t\t.and()\r\n    \t\t.addFilterBefore(jwtAuthenticationFilter,\r\n    \t\t\tUsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    @Override\r\n    public void configure(WebSecurity web) throws Exception {\r\n        web.ignoring()                \r\n                .antMatchers(&quot;/login**&quot;, &quot;/signup**&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of problems with this code: \r\n\r\n 1.

Any help would be appreciated.</p>\n<p>This is the example code (found on the wiki) I've been using for the websocket server:</p>\n<pre><code>import java.net.InetSocketAddress;\nimport java.nio.ByteBuffer;\n\nimport org.java_websocket.WebSocket;\nimport org.java_websocket.handshake.ClientHandshake;\nimport org.java_websocket.server.WebSocketServer;\n\npublic class SimpleServer extends WebSocketServer {\n\n    public SimpleServer(InetSocketAddress address) {\n        super(address);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onOpen(WebSocket conn, ClientHandshake handshake) {\n        conn.send(&quot;Welcome to the server!&quot;); //This method sends a message to the new client\n        broadcast( &quot;new connection: &quot; + handshake.getResourceDescriptor() ); //This method sends a message to all clients connected\n        System.out.println(&quot;new connection to &quot; + conn.getRemoteSocketAddress());\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onClose(WebSocket conn, int code, String reason, boolean remote) {\n        System.out.println(&quot;closed &quot; + conn.getRemoteSocketAddress() + &quot; with exit code &quot; + code + &quot; additional info: &quot; + reason);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onMessage(WebSocket conn, String message) {\n        System.out.println(&quot;received message from &quot; + conn.getRemoteSocketAddress() + &quot;: &quot; + message);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onMessage( WebSocket conn, ByteBuffer message ) {\n        System.out.println(&quot;received ByteBuffer from &quot;  + conn.getRemoteSocketAddress());\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onError(WebSocket conn, Exception ex) {\n        System.err.println(&quot;an error occurred on connection &quot; + conn.getRemoteSocketAddress()  + &quot;:&quot; + ex);\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public void onStart() {\n        System.out.println(&quot;server started successfully&quot;);\n    }\n\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String host = &quot;localhost&quot;;\n        int port = 2053;\n\n        WebSocketServer server = new SimpleServer(new InetSocketAddress(host, port));\n        server.run();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","mysql","xampp"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":39846,"reputation":991133,"user_id":115145,"accept_rate":84,"display_name":"CommonsWare"},"score":0,"creation_date":1675435962,"post_id":75337204,"comment_id":132934530,"body_markdown":"Please [reconsider your use of JDBC on Android](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15853367/jdbc-vs-web-service-for-android).","body":"Please <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15853367/jdbc-vs-web-service-for-android\">reconsider your use of JDBC on Android</a>."}],"owner":{"account_id":22957515,"reputation":1,"user_id":17087879,"display_name":"Rafał G&#243;rniak"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1675435975,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1675519804,"creation_date":1675434999,"question_id":75337204,"body_markdown":"I want to create simple app, where data from Mysql, hosted locally on xampp would be extracted and visible on phone.

This looks like:</p>\n<pre><code>text.fontProperty().bind(Bindings.createObjectBinding(\n    () -&gt; Font.font(slider.getValue()),\n    slider.valueProperty()\n));\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is a working <code>TextSlider</code> class using this binding:</p>\n<pre><code>import javafx.beans.binding.Bindings;\nimport javafx.beans.property.DoubleProperty;\nimport javafx.beans.property.StringProperty;\nimport javafx.geometry.Pos;\nimport javafx.scene.Node;\nimport javafx.scene.control.Slider;\nimport javafx.scene.layout.VBox;\nimport javafx.scene.text.Font;\nimport javafx.scene.text.Text;\n\npublic class TextSlider {\n\n    private Text text;\n    private Slider slider;\n    private VBox vbox;\n    private double initVal = 20;\n    public TextSlider(String text) {\n        this.text = new Text(text);\n        slider = new Slider(0,150,initVal);\n\n       // slider.setShowTickMarks(true);\n        //slider.setPadding(new Insets(10,10,10,10));\n\n        this.text.fontProperty().bind(Bindings.createObjectBinding(\n            () -&gt; Font.font(slider.getValue()),\n            slider.valueProperty()\n        ));        \n\n        vbox = new VBox(this.text,slider);\n        vbox.setAlignment(Pos.CENTER);\n    }\n\n    public Node asNode() {\n        return vbox ;\n    }\n\n    public StringProperty textProperty() {\n        return text.textProperty();\n    }\n\n    public final String getText() {\n        return textProperty().get();\n    }\n\n    public final void setText(String text) {\n        textProperty().set(text);\n    }\n\n    public DoubleProperty fontSizeProperty() {\n        return slider.valueProperty();\n    }\n\n    public final double getFontSize() {\n        return fontSizeProperty().get();\n    }\n\n    public final void setFontSize(double fontSize) {\n        fontSizeProperty().set(fontSize);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And a typical use case would look like:</p>\n<pre><code>import javafx.application.Application;\nimport javafx.scene.Scene;\nimport javafx.scene.layout.BorderPane;\nimport javafx.stage.Stage;\n\npublic class App extends Application {\n\n    @Override\n    public void start(Stage stage) {\n        BorderPane root = new BorderPane();\n        TextSlider textSlider = new TextSlider(&quot;Amsterdam&quot;);\n        root.setTop(textSlider.asNode());\n        \n        Scene scene = new Scene(root, 800, 800);\n        stage.setScene(scene);\n        stage.show();\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        launch();\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":21262431,"reputation":1,"user_id":15643076,"display_name":"WhiteWood City"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1675518407,"creation_date":1675518407,"answer_id":75345505,"question_id":66021586,"body_markdown":"from 19+\r\n\r\n```java\r\nslider.styleProperty().bind(fontProperty().map(f -&gt; &quot;-fx-font-size: &quot; + f.getSize()));\r\n```","title":"How to bind text size to slider in javafx?","body":"<p>from 19+</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>slider.styleProperty().bind(fontProperty().map(f -&gt; &quot;-fx-font-size: &quot; + f.getSize()));\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":20617232,"reputation":9,"user_id":15135018,"display_name":"Harley Quin "},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1134,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1675518407,"creation_date":1612328722,"question_id":66021586,"body_markdown":"Hi I am trying to display a Text object and a slider that controls the font size of the text. \r\nusing the JavaFX property value to observe the slider value change and then update the text size based on slider value.

TextViews and ShapableImageViews.\nThe standard ScrollView allows a smooth scrolling. But I want to have it like this in my app:</p>\n<p>As soon as the user scrolls, there should be no smooth scrolling, but it should automatically scroll from TextView1 to TextView2. When the user scrolls down again, it should automatically scroll to TextView3. And when user scrolls up, it should go back from TextView3 to TextView2.</p>\n<p>How do I achieve that custom scrolling behavior?\nI use Kolin, but also a help with Java code would be very appreciated.</p>\n<p>This is my XML:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;layout\n
