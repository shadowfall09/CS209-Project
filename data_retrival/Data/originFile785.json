I also tried implementing InitializingBean and putting my logic in afterPropertiesSet() but it never get's called either.</p>\n\n<p>How can I get notified when this configuration get's updated?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","sql","spring","jpa","jpql"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2795980,"reputation":63,"user_id":2405198,"display_name":"user2405198"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1671748597,"creation_date":1671748597,"answer_id":74894525,"question_id":74893352,"body_markdown":"You can use SQL instead HQL (nativeQuery=true)\r\n\r\n**DAO Layer**\r\n\r\n    package com.jb.app.repos;\r\n    \r\n    import com.jb.app.beans.Appointment;\r\n    import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;\r\n    import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query;\r\n    import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;\r\n    \r\n    import java.time.LocalDate;\r\n    import java.time.LocalTime;\r\n    import java.util.List;\r\n    \r\n    @Repository\r\n    public interface AppointmentRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Appointment, Integer&gt; {\r\n    \r\n        @Query(value = &quot;SELECT * FROM APPOINTMENT WHERE appointment_date = ?1 AND start_time = ?2 AND employee_id = ?3&quot;, nativeQuery = true)\r\n        List&lt;Appointment&gt; getAppointmentByDateAndEmployee(LocalDate appointmentDate, LocalTime startTime, int employeeId);\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n**Service Layer**\r\n\r\n    package com.jb.app.services;\r\n    \r\n    import com.jb.app.beans.Appointment;\r\n    import com.jb.app.beans.Employee;\r\n    import com.jb.app.repos.AppointmentRepository;\r\n    import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;\r\n    import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;\r\n    \r\n    import java.time.LocalDate;\r\n    import java.time.LocalTime;\r\n    import java.util.List;\r\n    \r\n\r\n    @Service\r\n    @RequiredArgsConstructor\r\n    public class AppointmentServiceImpl implements AppointmentService{\r\n        \r\n        private final AppointmentRepository appointmentRepository;\r\n        \r\n        @Override\r\n        public List&lt;Appointment&gt; getAppointmentByDateAndEmployee(LocalDate appointmentDate, LocalTime startTime, Employee e) {\r\n            return appointmentRepository.getAppointmentByDateAndEmployee(appointmentDate,startTime,e.getId());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n","title":"JPQL @Query for a ManyToOne relationship","body":"<p>You can use SQL instead HQL (nativeQuery=true)</p>\n<p><strong>DAO Layer</strong></p>\n<pre><code>package com.jb.app.repos;\n\nimport com.jb.app.beans.Appointment;\nimport org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;\nimport org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.Query;\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;\n\nimport java.time.LocalDate;\nimport java.time.LocalTime;\nimport java.util.List;\n\n@Repository\npublic interface AppointmentRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Appointment, Integer&gt; {\n\n    @Query(value = &quot;SELECT * FROM APPOINTMENT WHERE appointment_date = ?1 AND start_time = ?2 AND employee_id = ?3&quot;, nativeQuery = true)\n    List&lt;Appointment&gt; getAppointmentByDateAndEmployee(LocalDate appointmentDate, LocalTime startTime, int employeeId);\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Service Layer</strong></p>\n<pre><code>package com.jb.app.services;\n\nimport com.jb.app.beans.Appointment;\nimport com.jb.app.beans.Employee;\nimport com.jb.app.repos.AppointmentRepository;\nimport lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Service;\n\nimport java.time.LocalDate;\nimport java.time.LocalTime;\nimport java.util.List;\n\n\n@Service\n@RequiredArgsConstructor\npublic class AppointmentServiceImpl implements AppointmentService{\n    \n    private final AppointmentRepository appointmentRepository;\n    \n    @Override\n    public List&lt;Appointment&gt; getAppointmentByDateAndEmployee(LocalDate appointmentDate, LocalTime startTime, Employee e) {\n        return appointmentRepository.getAppointmentByDateAndEmployee(appointmentDate,startTime,e.getId());\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":18235483,"reputation":36,"user_id":13273596,"display_name":"Gorostiaga"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":95,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":74894525,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1671748597,"creation_date":1671739445,"question_id":74893352,"body_markdown":"Please I need some help.

For example, if `b` is `Integer` we should return it in `JSON` as number primitive which does not have quotes: `&quot;` chars around. To solve this problem we should use `POJO` model which allows us to find all required types. Let&#39;s create `POJO` model for our example:\r\n\r\n    @JsonFilter(&quot;allowedFields&quot;)\r\n    class Root {\r\n    \tprivate String a;\r\n    \tprivate Integer b;\r\n    \tprivate C c;\r\n    \r\n    \t// getters, setters\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    @JsonFilter(&quot;allowedFields&quot;)\r\n    class C {\r\n    \tprivate String c1;\r\n    \tprivate Integer c2;\r\n    \r\n    \t// getters, setters\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWe need to change our simple `XML -&gt; Map -&gt; JSON` algorithm to below one:\r\n\r\n 1. Read JSON as `Map` or `JsonNode`\r\n 2. Find all field names\r\n 3. Create `FilterProvider` with found names - notice that filter is registered with `allowedFields` name, the same which is used in `@JsonFilter` annotation.\r\n 4. Convert `Map` to `POJO` for type coercion.\r\n 5. Write `POJO` with filter\r\n\r\nSimple app could look like this:\r\n\r\n    import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonFilter;\r\n    import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode;\r\n    import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\r\n    import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ArrayNode;\r\n    import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.node.ObjectNode;\r\n    import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.impl.SimpleBeanPropertyFilter;\r\n    import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.impl.SimpleFilterProvider;\r\n    import com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.xml.XmlMapper;\r\n    \r\n    import java.io.File;\r\n    import java.util.HashSet;\r\n    import java.util.LinkedList;\r\n    import java.util.Set;\r\n    \r\n    public class JsonApp {\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n    \t\tFile xmlFile = new File(&quot;./resource/test.xml&quot;).getAbsoluteFile();\r\n    \r\n    \t\tNodesWalker walker = new NodesWalker();\r\n    \r\n    \t\tXmlMapper xmlMapper = new XmlMapper();\r\n    \t\tJsonNode root = xmlMapper.readValue(xmlFile, JsonNode.class);\r\n    \t\tSet&lt;String&gt; names = walker.findAllNames(root);\r\n    \r\n    \t\tSimpleFilterProvider filterProvider = new SimpleFilterProvider();\r\n    \t\tfilterProvider.addFilter(&quot;allowedFields&quot;, SimpleBeanPropertyFilter.filterOutAllExcept(names));\r\n    \r\n    \t\tObjectMapper jsonMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n    \t\tjsonMapper.setFilterProvider(filterProvider);\r\n    \r\n    \t\tRoot rootConverted = jsonMapper.convertValue(root, Root.class);\r\n    \t\tString json = jsonMapper.writeValueAsString(rootConverted);\r\n    \r\n    \t\tSystem.out.println(json);\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    class NodesWalker {\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic Set&lt;String&gt; findAllNames(JsonNode node) {\r\n    \t\tSet&lt;String&gt; names = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\r\n    \r\n    \t\tLinkedList&lt;JsonNode&gt; nodes = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    \t\tnodes.add(node);\r\n    \t\twhile (nodes.size() &gt; 0) {\r\n    \t\t\tJsonNode first = nodes.removeFirst();\r\n    \t\t\tif (first.isObject()) {\r\n    \t\t\t\tObjectNode objectNode = (ObjectNode) first;\r\n    \t\t\t\tobjectNode.fields().forEachRemaining(e -&gt; {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tnames.add(e.getKey());\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tJsonNode value = e.getValue();\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tif (value.isObject() || value.isArray()) {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\tnodes.add(value);\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\t});\r\n    \t\t\t} else if (first.isArray()) {\r\n    \t\t\t\tArrayNode arrayNode = (ArrayNode) first;\r\n    \t\t\t\tarrayNode.elements().forEachRemaining(e -&gt; {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tif (e.isObject() || e.isArray()) {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\tnodes.add(e);\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t\t});\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \r\n    \t\treturn names;\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nTest 1-0\r\n--------\r\nInput `XML`:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Root&gt;\r\n        &lt;a&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;\r\n        &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;\r\n        &lt;c&gt;\r\n            &lt;c1&gt;Rick&lt;/c1&gt;\r\n            &lt;c2&gt;58&lt;/c2&gt;\r\n        &lt;/c&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Root&gt;\r\n\r\nOutput `JSON`:\r\n\r\n    {&quot;a&quot;:&quot;A&quot;,&quot;b&quot;:1,&quot;c&quot;:{&quot;c1&quot;:&quot;Rick&quot;,&quot;c2&quot;:58}}\r\n\r\nTest 1-1\r\n--------\r\nInput `XML`:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Root&gt;\r\n        &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;\r\n        &lt;c&gt;\r\n            &lt;c2/&gt;\r\n        &lt;/c&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Root&gt;\r\n\r\nOutput `JSON`:\r\n\r\n    {&quot;b&quot;:1,&quot;c&quot;:{&quot;c2&quot;:null}}\r\n\r\nTest 1-2\r\n--------\r\nInput `XML`:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Root&gt;\r\n        &lt;c/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Root&gt;\r\n\r\nOutput `JSON`:\r\n\r\n    {&quot;c&quot;:null}\r\n\r\nAfter all these tests we see that dynamic checking whether field is `null`, `empty` or `absent` is not an easy task. Even so, above 2 solutions work for simple models you should test them for all responses you want to generate. When model is complex and contains many complex annotations such as: `@JsonTypeInfo`, `@JsonSubTypes` on `Jackson` side or `@XmlElementWrapper`, `@XmlAnyElement` on `JAXB` side it make this task very hard to implement.\r\n\r\nI think the best solution in your example is to use `@JsonInclude(NON_NULL)` which send to client all set fields on `XML` side. `null` and `absent` should be treated on client side identically. Business logic should not rely on the fact field is set to `null` or `absent` in `JSON` payload.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n\r\n - [what is the convention in JSON for empty vs. null?][1]\r\n - [Representing null in JSON][2]\r\n - [Implement PATCH method with Lombok and MapStruct][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9619852/what-is-the-convention-in-json-for-empty-vs-null\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21120999/representing-null-in-json\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74886852/how-to-deserialize-json-and-distinguish-null-from-the-absence-of-a-value","title":"How to differentiate null value fields from absent fields in jackson library","body":"<p>If you want to differentiate <code>null</code> value fields from absent fields the most generic method will be using <code>Map</code> or <code>JsonNode</code> instead of <code>POJO</code>. <code>POJO</code> class has constant structure, <code>Map</code> or <code>JsonNode</code> have dynamic - contains only what you actually put there.

To distinguish `null` from `absence` we can use `java.util.Optional` class.\r\n\r\n - `SampleCompleteRequest` class we use together with `POST` (create) and `PUT` (update) methods.\r\n - `SamplePartialRequest` class we use together with `PATCH` (partially update) method.\r\n\r\nTo avoid boilerplate code in this example I&#39;m using [Lombok][1] and [MapStruct][2] but it is not required.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nModel\r\n-----\r\n```java\r\nimport jakarta.validation.constraints.NotBlank;\r\nimport lombok.Data;\r\n\r\n@Data\r\npublic class SampleCompleteRequest {\r\n\r\n\t@NotBlank\r\n\tprivate String name;\r\n\tprivate String value;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport jakarta.validation.constraints.NotBlank;\r\nimport lombok.Data;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.Optional;\r\n\r\n@Data\r\npublic class SamplePartialRequest {\r\n\tprivate Optional&lt;@NotBlank String&gt; name;\r\n\tprivate Optional&lt;String&gt; value;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport lombok.Data;\r\n\r\n@Data\r\npublic class SampleResponse {\r\n\tprivate Long id;\r\n\tprivate String name;\r\n\tprivate String value;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport lombok.Data;\r\n\r\n@Data\r\npublic class Sample {\r\n    //@Id - Hibernate annotations are removed\r\n\tprivate Long id;\r\n\tprivate String name;\r\n\tprivate String value;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMapStruct\r\n---------\r\nIn `MapStruct` we need to define an interface with all methods we need.\r\n```java\r\nimport com.example.demo.model.SampleCompleteRequest;\r\nimport com.example.demo.model.SamplePartialRequest;\r\nimport com.example.demo.model.SampleResponse;\r\nimport jakarta.annotation.Nullable;\r\nimport org.mapstruct.BeanMapping;\r\nimport org.mapstruct.Mapper;\r\nimport org.mapstruct.MappingTarget;\r\nimport org.mapstruct.ReportingPolicy;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.Optional;\r\n\r\nimport static org.mapstruct.MappingConstants.ComponentModel.SPRING;\r\nimport static org.mapstruct.NullValueCheckStrategy.ALWAYS;\r\nimport static org.mapstruct.NullValuePropertyMappingStrategy.IGNORE;\r\n\r\n@Mapper(unmappedTargetPolicy = ReportingPolicy.IGNORE, componentModel = SPRING)\r\npublic interface SamplesMapper {\r\n\t@BeanMapping(nullValueCheckStrategy = ALWAYS, nullValuePropertyMappingStrategy = IGNORE)\r\n\tSample patch(SamplePartialRequest input, @MappingTarget Sample target);\r\n\r\n\tSample update(SampleCompleteRequest input, @MappingTarget Sample target);\r\n\r\n\tSampleResponse mapToResponse(Sample input);\r\n\r\n\tdefault String optionalToString(@Nullable Optional&lt;String&gt; nullable) {\r\n\t\treturn nullable == null ? null : nullable.orElse(null);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlugin will generate boilerplate code for us.

As you can see, the IDE(Netbeans in my case), was not able to find 'runfx.args' which is set in Project Properties.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2228413,"reputation":816,"user_id":1966655,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"swapnil gandhi"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1531753065,"creation_date":1531753065,"answer_id":51364716,"question_id":20077870,"body_markdown":"&gt; Restart Netbeans &amp; it solved my problem.","title":"Maven won&#39;t run my Project : Failed to execute goal org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.2.1:exec","body":"<blockquote>\n  <p>Restart Netbeans &amp; it solved my problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":16063387,"reputation":1,"user_id":11593698,"display_name":"imane"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1560764921,"creation_date":1560758647,"answer_id":56627141,"question_id":20077870,"body_markdown":"Im new to java hibernate but i could solve this problem, this is how i did it :\r\nI was working with hibernate and maven project.\r\nFirst you have to put persistence.xml under project directory, then add jdbc manually.\r\nMaven couldn&#39;t download my dependency so i added it manually.\r\nIn the persistence.xml in design jdbc connection add it manually ps: i work with netbeans good luck","title":"Maven won&#39;t run my Project : Failed to execute goal org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.2.1:exec","body":"<p>Im new to java hibernate but i could solve this problem, this is how i did it :\nI was working with hibernate and maven project.\nFirst you have to put persistence.xml under project directory, then add jdbc manually.\nMaven couldn't download my dependency so i added it manually.\nIn the persistence.xml in design jdbc connection add it manually ps: i work with netbeans good luck</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":187539,"reputation":145,"user_id":425674,"display_name":"Mike"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1566935612,"creation_date":1566935612,"answer_id":57681401,"question_id":20077870,"body_markdown":"For me, the clue was the &quot;org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.2.1:exec&quot;.  \r\nThe only place this was referenced was in the &quot;Run project&quot; action under Project Properties=&gt;Actions.\r\n\r\nWhen I changed this action to match the HelloFXMLWithMaven sample project (available in Netbeans 11.1):\r\n&quot;clean javafx:run&quot;\r\nthen executing the Run goal was able to proceed.\r\n\r\nNote, I also had to update the pom file&#39;s javafx-maven-plugin to also match the sample project but with the mainClass changed for my project.\r\n","title":"Maven won&#39;t run my Project : Failed to execute goal org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.2.1:exec","body":"<p>For me, the clue was the \"org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.2.1:exec\".<br>\nThe only place this was referenced was in the \"Run project\" action under Project Properties=>Actions.</p>\n\n<p>When I changed this action to match the HelloFXMLWithMaven sample project (available in Netbeans 11.1):\n\"clean javafx:run\"\nthen executing the Run goal was able to proceed.</p>\n\n<p>Note, I also had to update the pom file's javafx-maven-plugin to also match the sample project but with the mainClass changed for my project.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":22716825,"reputation":1,"user_id":16881939,"display_name":"Mikita"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1671747354,"creation_date":1671747354,"answer_id":74894382,"question_id":20077870,"body_markdown":"Rohith H.Y Solved this problem\r\n\r\n2.

Here is the shorten sample:</p>\n<pre><code>@SpringBootApplication\n@EnableScheduling\npublic class ScheduledServiceApp implements SchedulingConfigurer {\n    private static final int POOL_SIZE = 20;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n       SpringApplication.run(ScheduledServiceApp.class, args);\n    }\n\n\n    @Override\n    public void configureTasks(ScheduledTaskRegistrar scheduledTaskRegistrar) {\n        ThreadPoolTaskScheduler threadPoolTaskScheduler = new ThreadPoolTaskScheduler();\n\n        threadPoolTaskScheduler.setPoolSize(POOL_SIZE);\n        threadPoolTaskScheduler.setThreadNamePrefix(&quot;scheduled-task-pool-&quot;);\n        threadPoolTaskScheduler.initialize();\n\n        scheduledTaskRegistrar.setTaskScheduler(threadPoolTaskScheduler);\n     }\n}\n\n\n@Component\npublic class ScheduledTask {\n\n    // .....\n\n    @Scheduled(cron = &quot;${task.cron.expression}&quot;, zone=&quot;UTC&quot;)\n    // @Modifying(clearAutomatically = true, flushAutomatically = true)\n    @Transactional\n    public void runTask() {\n        try {\n            // .....\n\n            ThreadPoolExecutor executor = (ThreadPoolExecutor) Executors.newFixedThreadPool(THREAD_COUNT);\n\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; THREAD_COUNT; ++i) {\n                Runnable task = new TaskThread();\n                executor.execute(task);\n            }\n\n            executor.shutdown();\n\n            while (!executor.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {\n                // wait until the processes in the executor will be terminated\n            }\n\n            log.info(&quot;Task is completed successfully&quot;);\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            // log the error\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\npublic class TaskThread implements Runnable {\n    // .....\n\n    public void run() {\n        dataService.insertData(/* parameters */);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each separate thread execution may last for ~30min because of the huge amount of data to be processed and after the task's completion, in MySQL console I still see the corresponding processes which are in 'sleep' mode and which are being terminated only after the timeout value reaches.</p>\n<p>As you can see in the code, <code>@Modifying</code> annotation with its parameters didn't help either. Also, I don't want to decrease the timeout value since that may affect on queries running directly in MySQL as well. But I would like to terminate those processes since they affect on application's overall performance.</p>\n<p><strong>So my questions is:</strong> is there a solution which will make the MySQL processes to be terminated instead of being slept when my task is finished?</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Forgot to mention that the application is completely container managed and running under Tomcat. JDBC/ODBC bridge for MySQL (Aurora Serverless MySQL 5.7 compatible).</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","junit"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":15396644,"reputation":25755,"user_id":11107541,"display_name":"starball"},"score":0,"creation_date":1671746246,"post_id":74890253,"comment_id":132169737,"body_markdown":"Welcome to SO!

Effectively that means specifying everything on both sides rather than relying on defaults.  You can only use defaults if you are using the same system at both ends.  Even then, it is better to specify exactly.\r\n\r\nKey, IV, encryption mode, padding and string to bytes conversion all need to be the same at both ends.  It is especially worth checking that the key bytes are the same.

So I have a spring crud app and my date is a String, not a date object, and is shown as 2023-07-01 in my table, all good. Now is there an easy way to simply make this string into a date object so I can do <code>${#dates.format(employee.contractedFrom), 'dd-MMM-yyyy'}</code> WITHOUT having to change my contractedTo object to <code>Date</code>? I've tried #temporals and #calendars but no luck. Thanks in advance.</p>\n<p>Contracted from entity</p>\n<pre><code>@JsonFormat(pattern = &quot;yyyy-MM-dd&quot;, shape = JsonFormat.Shape.STRING)\n    @Column(name = &quot;contracted_from&quot;)\n

The classic for loop looks like this:\r\n\r\n      for(counter=0;counter &lt;= iterations;counter++){   }\r\n\r\nthe first param is a counter variable. the second param expresses how long the loop should last, and the 3rd param expresses how much the counter should be incremented by after each pass.\r\n\r\nif we want to loop from 1 - 10, we do the following:\r\n\r\n    for(counter=1;counter&lt;=10;counter++){ System.out.println(counter); }\r\n\r\nif we want to loop from 10 - 1, we do the following:\r\n\r\n    for(counter=10;counter&gt;=1;counter--){  System.out.println(counter); }\r\n\r\nif we want to loop through a 2 dimensional collection, like...\r\n\r\n\r\n    1 2 3\r\n    4 5 6\r\n    7 8 9\r\n\r\n    int[][] grid = new int[][] {{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}};\r\n\r\nwe need 2 loops.

This will calculate the length of each row as they are being looped through.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to ask any questions you may have regarding for loops!\r\n\r\nEDIT: understanding the question.....\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are going to have to do several things with your code.

You definitely not want to do all the `this.x=x` and replace all such constructors of the below form and with lombok.\r\n    ```java\r\n    public SomeClass(A a, B b, C c,.............) {\r\n        this.a = a;\r\n        this.b = b;\r\n        this.c = c;\r\n        ........\r\n        ........\r\n        someInitLogic();\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n 2. `someInitLogic()` is a new method and the class is part of an API or there are lots of places were the constructor is being invoked. So you do not want to force any code changes in the callers.\r\n \r\nFor anyone with the above issues, I suggest a workaround as follows:\r\n\r\n 1. Add a dummy `final` variable to your class. Make it `transient` if class is `Serializable`.\r\n    ```java\r\n    @Getter(value = AccessLevel.NONE)\r\n    private final transient boolean dummy;\r\n    ```\r\n 2. Make the access level in `@AllArgsConstructor` or `@RequiredArgsConstructor` as **private** (even if you use a `staticName`), so that the constructor with the dummy parameter is not accessible outside.\r\n    ```java\r\n    @RequiredArgsConstructor(staticName = &quot;of&quot;,access = AccessLevel.PRIVATE)\r\n    ```\r\n    or\r\n    ```java\r\n    @AllArgsConstructor(access = AccessLevel.PRIVATE)\r\n    ```\r\n3. Write a constructor or static method which matches with the one that is currently being invoked as below:\r\n\r\n    ```java\r\n    public MyClass(A a, B b, C c,.......) {\r\n        this(a,b,c,......, false /* dummy*/);\r\n        someInitLogic();\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n    Or if you were using `static` method to invoke the constructor:\r\n    ```java\r\n    public static MyClass of(A a, B b,......) {\r\n        MyClass obj = MyClass.of(a,b,......, false /* dummy*/);\r\n        obj.someInitLogic();\r\n        return obj;\r\n    }\r\n    ```    \r\n\r\nThis way you could reduce the boiler plate code, but at the same do not cause any code changes in the callers and could be easily refactored as soon as `@PostConstruct` is available.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/1207\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/67808478/7804477","title":"Is there any &quot;PostConstruct&quot; feature of lombok?","body":"<p>Since <a href=\"https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/issues/1207\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">@PostConstruct</a> is still an open issue and similar <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/67808478/7804477\">questions</a> have popped up, I would like to suggest a workaround which could be followed if you have any of the below problems:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You definitely not want to do all the <code>this.x=x</code> and replace all such constructors of the below form and with lombok.\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public SomeClass(A a, B b, C c,.............) {\n    this.a = a;\n    this.b = b;\n    this.c = c;\n    ........\n    ........\n    someInitLogic();\n}\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><code>someInitLogic()</code> is a new method and the class is part of an API or there are lots of places were the constructor is being invoked.
