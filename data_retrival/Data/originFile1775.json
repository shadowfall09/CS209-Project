Please let me know in the comment if you want me to fix or clarify something.\r\n\r\nSource Code : https://github.com/asinkxcoswt/stackoverflow-merge-task-lcs\r\n\r\n# Problem Analysis\r\n\r\nAccording to your explanation, we have 3 sequences of non-repeating, unordered tasks. The sequences can be &quot;merged&quot; so that some common tasks can be executed together to reduce time and resources. But usually, there are many ways to merge. You are finding the way that gives the best in terms of \r\n\r\n&gt; - Maximum possible merge points\r\n&gt; - Maximum possible parallel execution\r\n&gt; - Least number of steps to be executed altogether\r\n\r\nThis can be viewed as an optimization problem in which you are trying to minimize the **cost** of **resources** and **duration**.\r\n\r\n- **resources** (steps): you want to have the least number of steps and this has the same meaning as the &quot;maximum possible merge points&quot; (because the more tasks you merge, the fewer steps you have. This can be the number of the square box in the picture when each task use `resources = 1`.\r\n\r\n- **duration**: you want the &quot;maximum parallel execution&quot;, but I still find it a bit uncleared about how to measure. So I guess you actually want the tasks to be done as fast as possible, which means you want to minimize the total duration, which can be the number of horizontal rows in the picture when each row represents `duration = 1`.\r\n\r\nYou can observe that the state of the input (before merging) is where you already have the minimum **duration** (maximum parallel execution) but maximum **resources**. This means our merging algorithm can only do 2 things.\r\n\r\n1. (Bad) Make the **duration** increase or stay the same.\r\n2. (Good) Make the **resources** decrease or stay the same.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we are going to reduce the **resources** at the cost of making the tasks take a longer time to complete. We cannot determine which solution is the best until we define the final **cost** in terms of these 2 factors. For example, one may prefer to have as minimum resources as possible regardless of the duration, others may prefer differently.\r\n\r\n- **cost**: for the sake of simplicity, I will use, as an example here, the definition `cost = resources * duration`, which can be thought of as the money you pay for `resources` number of workers by the `duration` they work.\r\n\r\n- **goal**: So the goal of this optimization is to find the way to merge 3 task sequences that give the minimum cost = `resources * duration`\r\n\r\n\r\n# Solution Overview\r\n\r\nThe nature of this problem is very similar to the well-known [Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem). We can say that each possible merging result is a one-to-one correspondence to a common subsequence of the 3 task lists. But unlike the LCS problem, we cannot say the longest one is the best for us. Instead, we have to find all possible common subsequences and calculate their corresponding `cost`, then choose the one with the least `cost`. \r\n\r\n# Implemetation\r\n\r\n\r\n## Code Infrastructure\r\n\r\nBefore talking in detail about LCS, let first translate the problem into code.\r\n\r\n### Task\r\n\r\nA task is a unit that holds the `duration` and `resources` we are going to optimize. It usually has a `run()` method to define what it is supposed to do. The `id` is here because we have to identify and equalize them. Here if 2 tasks have the same `id`, I will treat them as the same task.\r\n\r\n```Java\r\nabstract class Task {\r\n    public abstract String id();\r\n    public abstract void run();\r\n    public abstract int duration();\r\n    public abstract int resources();\r\n    public int cost() {\r\n        return this.duration() * this.resources();\r\n    };\r\n\r\n     /**\r\n     * Just a convenient method to create a task with a one-liner\r\n     */\r\n    static Task of(String id, int duration, int resource, Runnable execution) {\r\n        return new Task() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void run() {\r\n                execution.run();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            @Override\r\n            public int duration() {\r\n                return duration;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            @Override\r\n            public int resources() {\r\n                return resource;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            @Override\r\n            public String id() {\r\n                return id;\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is how the tasks are prepared. Please notice that every task is created with `resources=1` and `duration=1`, but you can change them as your desire.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Task A = Task.of(&quot;A&quot;,1, 1, () -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;I&#39;m task A&quot;));\r\n        Task B = Task.of(&quot;B&quot;,1, 1, () -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;I&#39;m task B&quot;));\r\n        Task C = Task.of(&quot;C&quot;,1, 1, () -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;I&#39;m task C&quot;));\r\n        Task D = Task.of(&quot;D&quot;,1, 1, () -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;I&#39;m task D&quot;));\r\n        Task E = Task.of(&quot;E&quot;,1, 1, () -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;I&#39;m task E&quot;));\r\n        Task U = Task.of(&quot;U&quot;,1, 1, () -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;I&#39;m task U&quot;));\r\n        Task W = Task.of(&quot;W&quot;,1, 1, () -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;I&#39;m task W&quot;));\r\n        Task X = Task.of(&quot;X&quot;,1, 1, () -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;I&#39;m task X&quot;));\r\n        Task Y = Task.of(&quot;Y&quot;,1, 1, () -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;I&#39;m task Y&quot;));\r\n        Task Z = Task.of(&quot;Z&quot;,1, 1, () -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;I&#39;m task Z&quot;));\r\n\r\n        Task[] case1 = new Task[] {A,B,C,D,E};\r\n        Task[] case2 = new Task[] {W,B,A,U,C,E};\r\n        Task[] case3 = new Task[] {B,X,Y,Z,E,A,C};\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ParallelTask\r\n\r\nA `ParallelTask` takes arbitrary number task lists. Its `run()` method executes all task lists in parallel. But each task in a specific list still is executed in sequence. It also aggregates the `duration` and `resources` of its underlying tasks. The `duration` of a parallel task will equal the `duration` of the longest list. While the `resources` is just the simple sum of every task&#39;s `resources`.\r\n\r\n```Java\r\nclass ParallelTask extends Task {\r\n    private final String id;\r\n    private final Task[][] taskSequences;\r\n    ParallelTask(String id, Task[] ... taskSequences) {\r\n        this.id = id;\r\n        this.taskSequences = taskSequences;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void run() {\r\n        Arrays.stream(this.taskSequences).parallel().forEach(taskSeq -&gt; {\r\n            Arrays.stream(taskSeq).forEach(Task::run);\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int duration() {\r\n        IntStream eachSequenceTotalDuration = Arrays.stream(this.taskSequences).mapToInt(\r\n                taskSeq -&gt; Arrays.stream(taskSeq).mapToInt(Task::duration).sum()\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        return eachSequenceTotalDuration.max().orElse(0);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int resources() {\r\n        IntStream eachSequenceTotalResources = Arrays.stream(this.taskSequences).mapToInt(\r\n                taskSeq -&gt; Arrays.stream(taskSeq).mapToInt(Task::resources).sum()\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        return eachSequenceTotalResources.sum();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public String id() {\r\n        return this.id;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Initial Cost\r\n\r\nYou can run follow code and see that the initial cost (before merging) is `126`.  \r\n\r\n```Java\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\r\n    ... init tasks ...\r\n\r\n    Task[] case1 = new Task[] {A,B,C,D,E};\r\n    Task[] case2 = new Task[] {W,B,A,U,C,E};\r\n    Task[] case3 = new Task[] {B,X,Y,Z,E,A,C};\r\n\r\n    Task p = new ParallelTask(&quot;INITIAL_SOLUTION&quot;, case1, case2, case3);\r\n    // p.run(); // &lt;-- try this if you want\r\n    System.out.println(p.cost()); // &lt;-- 126\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Full Report\r\n\r\nFor convenience, let&#39;s add a method to print the full report to see the `cost`, `duration`, `resources`, and how to tasks are organized.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass ParallelTask extends Task {\r\n    ... other methods ...\r\n\r\n    public void report(boolean showSummary) {\r\n        if (showSummary) {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;------------------------&quot;);\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;TASK &quot; + this.id() + &quot; (COST &quot; + this.cost() + &quot;, DURATION &quot; + this.duration() + &quot;, RESOURCES &quot; + this.resources() + &quot;)&quot;);\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;------------------------&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        int l = Arrays.stream(this.taskSequences).mapToInt(taskSeq -&gt; taskSeq.length).max().orElse(0);\r\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; l; j ++) {\r\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; this.taskSequences.length; i++) {\r\n                if (this.taskSequences[i].length - 1 &lt; j) {\r\n                    System.out.print(&quot;  &quot;);\r\n                    continue;\r\n                }\r\n                Task task = this.taskSequences[i][j];\r\n                if (task instanceof ParallelTask p) {\r\n                    p.report(false);\r\n                } else if (task instanceof MergedTask m) {\r\n                    System.out.println(task.id());\r\n                } else {\r\n                    System.out.print(task.id() + &quot; &quot;);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `p.report(true)` will print something like this.\r\n\r\n```\r\n------------------------\r\nTASK INITIAL_SOLUTION (COST 126, DURATION 7, RESOURCES 18)\r\n------------------------\r\nA W B \r\nB B X \r\nC A Y \r\nD U Z \r\nE C E \r\n  E A \r\n    C \r\n```\r\n\r\n### MergedTask\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s define another special task. A `MergedTask` wraps a normal task and reduces its&#39;s `resources` by 3 times (because it merges 3 boxes into 1).\r\n\r\n```Java\r\nclass MergedTask extends Task {\r\n\r\n    private final Task originalTask;\r\n    MergedTask(Task originalTask) {\r\n        this.originalTask = originalTask;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void run() {\r\n        originalTask.run();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int duration() {\r\n        return originalTask.duration();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int resources() {\r\n        return originalTask.resources()/3;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public String id() {\r\n        return &quot;MERGED(&quot; + originalTask.id() + &quot;)&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Manual Solution\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s see how the code will look like if we try to solve the problem by hand (without using any algorithm yet)\r\n\r\n```Java\r\n\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    Task p1 = new ParallelTask(\r\n            &quot;p1&quot;,\r\n            new Task[] {A},\r\n            new Task[] {W}\r\n    );\r\n    Task m1 = new MergedTask(B);\r\n    Task p2 = new ParallelTask(\r\n            &quot;p2&quot;,\r\n            new Task[] {C, D},\r\n            new Task[] {A, U, C},\r\n            new Task[] {X, Y, Z}\r\n    );\r\n    Task m2 = new MergedTask(E);\r\n    Task p3 = new ParallelTask(\r\n            &quot;p3&quot;,\r\n            new Task[] {A, C}\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    new ParallelTask(&quot;MANUAL_MERGED_TASK&quot;, new Task[] {p1, m1, p2, m2, p3}).report(true);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere I manually construct the case when we merge at `B` and `E`. As you can see from the following report, its cost is `96`, even though the `duration = 8` is worse, the cost is clearly better than the initial cost. But is it the best? We must find all possible solutions to tell.\r\n\r\n```\r\n------------------------\r\nTASK MANUAL_MERGED_TASK (COST 96, DURATION 8, RESOURCES 12)\r\n------------------------\r\nA W \r\n\r\nMERGED(B)\r\n\r\nC A X \r\nD U Y \r\n  C Z \r\n\r\nMERGED(E)\r\n\r\nA \r\nC \r\n```\r\n\r\n## LCS\r\n\r\nWe will modify the LCS algorithm to find all possible common subsequences of the 3 task lists `case1`, `case2`, and `case3`. I will omit the full implementation of this modified LCS because it will be too much for this post, you can find the source code on my [Github](https://github.com/asinkxcoswt/stackoverflow-merge-task-lcs).\r\n\r\n```Java\r\nSet&lt;List&lt;Cell&gt;&gt; findAllCommonSubsequences(List&lt;Task&gt; case1, List&lt;Task&gt; case2, List&lt;Task&gt; case3, String axisOrder) {\r\n    ... see that full implemation on my Github ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function will give you a `Set` of possible common subsequences. `List&lt;Cell&gt;` is a subsequence, sorry it is not an intuitive notation, hopefully, you can understand from its example value below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  [Cell(xyz=136,ref=025,common=true,tasks=A)], \r\n  [Cell(xyz=221,ref=110,common=true,tasks=B), Cell(xyz=357,ref=246,common=true,tasks=C)], \r\n  [Cell(xyz=221,ref=110,common=true,tasks=B), Cell(xyz=565,ref=454,common=true,tasks=E)], \r\n  [Cell(xyz=136,ref=025,common=true,tasks=A), Cell(xyz=357,ref=246,common=true,tasks=C)], \r\n  [Cell(xyz=221,ref=110,common=true,tasks=B)]\r\n]\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThese are all possible common subsequences of the following input task lists.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTask[] case1 = new Task[] {A,B,C,D,E};\r\nTask[] case2 = new Task[] {W,B,A,U,C,E};\r\nTask[] case3 = new Task[] {B,X,Y,Z,E,A,C};\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsider an example sequence `[Cell(xyz=136,ref=025,common=true,tasks=A)]`. This sequence has only 1 common element (task `A`). The number `xyz=136` indicates the position of `A` in each input list `case1`, `case2` and `case3` respectively. The `ref=025` is a part of LCS implementation details, you know what it means if you know LCS, hopefully. In summary, here all common subsequences are `A`, `B`. `BC`, `BE`, and `AC`.\r\n\r\n### Merge The Tasks\r\n\r\nYou may have noticed from the **Manual Solution** section that the final result we actually want will always be of the form\r\n\r\n```Java\r\nnew ParallelTask(&quot;SOLUTION&quot;, new Task[] {p1, m1, p2, m2, p3, m4, p4, ...})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, we are going to use a common subsequence, such as `B E`, to divide the 3 input task lists into `n` `ParallelTask`s (`p1, p2, p3, ..., pn`) and `n-1` `MergedTask`s (`m1, m2, m3, ..., m{n-1}`), and then put them into a single `ParallelTask`. Each `MergedTask` corresponds to each element in the common subsequence.\r\n\r\nHere is a method that can do so. It is not elegant but hopefully, you got the big picture.\r\n\r\n```Java\r\nParallelTask merge(List&lt;Cell&gt; commonSubsequence, List&lt;Task&gt; case1, List&lt;Task&gt; case2, List&lt;Task&gt; case3) {\r\n\r\n        // pad cell index to prevent confusion, because the original cells will have indices = taskList&#39;s index - 1 due to LCS algorithm\r\n        List&lt;Cell&gt; commonSubsequencePadded = commonSubsequence.stream()\r\n                .map(cell -&gt; new Cell(cell.value, cell.x - 1, cell.y - 1, cell.z -1, 0, 0, 0, true, cell.taskX, cell.taskY, cell.taskZ))\r\n                .toList();\r\n        System.out.println(commonSubsequencePadded);\r\n\r\n        Cell prevCell = null;\r\n        int taskNameIndex = 1;\r\n        StringBuilder finalResultTaskName = new StringBuilder(&quot;MERGED_TASK(&quot;);\r\n        List&lt;Task&gt; merged = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n        for (Cell cell : commonSubsequencePadded) {\r\n            int startL1 = prevCell == null ? 0 : prevCell.x + 1;\r\n            int startL2 = prevCell == null ? 0 : prevCell.y + 1;\r\n            int startL3 = prevCell == null ? 0 : prevCell.z + 1;\r\n            Task[] l1 = cell.x == startL1 ? new Task[0] : case1.subList(startL1, cell.x).toArray(new Task[0]);\r\n            Task[] l2 = cell.y == startL2 ? new Task[0] : case2.subList(startL2, cell.y).toArray(new Task[0]);\r\n            Task[] l3 = cell.z == startL3 ? new Task[0] : case3.subList(startL3, cell.z).toArray(new Task[0]);\r\n            Task p = new ParallelTask(&quot;p&quot; + taskNameIndex, l1, l2, l3);\r\n            Task m = new MergedTask(cell.taskX);\r\n            merged.add(p);\r\n            merged.add(m);\r\n\r\n            prevCell = cell;\r\n            taskNameIndex++;\r\n            finalResultTaskName.append(cell.taskX.id());\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // if there are some remaining tasks after the last merge point\r\n        if (prevCell != null &amp;&amp; (prevCell.x + 1 &lt; case1.size() || prevCell.y + 1 &lt; case2.size() || prevCell.z + 1 &lt; case3.size())) {\r\n            Task[] l1 = prevCell.x + 1 &lt; case1.size() ? case1.subList(prevCell.x + 1, case1.size()).toArray(new Task[0]) : new Task[0];\r\n            Task[] l2 = prevCell.y + 1 &lt; case2.size() ? case2.subList(prevCell.y + 1, case2.size()).toArray(new Task[0]) : new Task[0];\r\n            Task[] l3 = prevCell.z + 1 &lt; case3.size() ? case3.subList(prevCell.z + 1, case3.size()).toArray(new Task[0]) : new Task[0];\r\n            Task p = new ParallelTask(&quot;p&quot; + taskNameIndex, l1, l2, l3);\r\n            merged.add(p);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return new ParallelTask(finalResultTaskName.append(&quot;)&quot;).toString(), merged.toArray(new Task[0]));\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Let&#39;s See The Result\r\n\r\nWiring them all together.\r\n\r\n```Java\r\nSet&lt;List&lt;Cell&gt;&gt; allCommonSubsequenceList = findAllCommonSubsequences(List.of(case1), List.of(case2), List.of(case3), &quot;XYZ&quot;);\r\n        List&lt;ParallelTask&gt; allPossibleMergeList = allCommonSubsequenceList.stream().map(commonSubsequence -&gt; merge(commonSubsequence, List.of(case1), List.of(case2), List.of(case3))).toList();\r\n\r\n        allPossibleMergeList.forEach(t -&gt; t.report(true));\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere are the results for the 5 possible common subsequences `A`, `B`, `BC`, `BE`, and `AC`.

So it will be another level difficult to write code that can handle `N` list.\r\n\r\nBut I think maybe we can use another way. We can first find all common subsequences of the first two lists. And then combine the result with the rest `N-2` lists and find their common subsequences recursively.\r\n\r\nI have added an example code for this idea in the `/improved` folder of the original code on my Github.\r\n\r\nI created a class `CommonSubsequenceFinder`, like this\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class CommonSubsequenceFinder {\r\n    public &lt;T&gt; Set&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; findAllIn2Lists(List&lt;T&gt; l1, List&lt;T&gt; l2) {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public &lt;T&gt; Set&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; findAllInNList(List&lt;T&gt; ... listArray) {\r\n        if (listArray.length &lt;= 1) {\r\n            return new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        List&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; lists = Arrays.asList(listArray);\r\n\r\n        List&lt;T&gt; firstList = lists.get(0);\r\n        List&lt;T&gt; secondList = lists.get(1);\r\n\r\n        Set&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; commonSubsequences = findAllIn2Lists(firstList, secondList);\r\n\r\n        if (commonSubsequences.isEmpty()) {\r\n            return commonSubsequences;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (lists.size() == 2) {\r\n            return commonSubsequences;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(commonSubsequences);\r\n\r\n        Set&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; commonSubsequencesEx = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\r\n        List&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; theRest = lists.subList(2, lists.size());\r\n        for (List&lt;T&gt; subSeq : commonSubsequences) {\r\n            List&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; l = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n            l.add(subSeq);\r\n            l.addAll(theRest);\r\n            commonSubsequencesEx.addAll(findAllInNList(l.toArray(new List[l.size()])));\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return commonSubsequencesEx;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the class, you will find two public methods `findAllIn2Lists(...)` and `findAllInNList(...)`.\r\n\r\nThe `findAllIn2Lists(...)` can find all common subsequences of 2 lists. I make it to support a generic type, you can put the list of anything not limited to just a `Task`, but with a note that the class must implement method `equals(...)` and `hashCode(...)` properly. For example, I have added the methods in `Task` like below, which then allow us to compare the equality of 2 tasks such as `t1.equals(t2)` and it will return `true` if `t1` and `t2` have the same `id`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nabstract class Task {\r\n    public abstract String id();\r\n    public abstract void run();\r\n    public abstract int duration();\r\n    public abstract int resources();\r\n    public int cost() {\r\n        return this.duration() * this.resources();\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    @Override\r\n    public String toString() {\r\n        return this.id();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean equals(Object o) {\r\n        if (this == o) return true;\r\n        if (o == null) return false;\r\n        if (o instanceof Task t) {\r\n            return id().equals(t.id());\r\n        }\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int hashCode() {\r\n        return Objects.hash(id());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother method in `CommonSubsequenceFinder` is `findAllInNList(...)`. This is the aforementioned recursive method. You can put following code in the main method to see its result.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nSet&lt;List&lt;Task&gt;&gt; allCommonSubsequences = new CommonSubsequenceFinder().findAllInNList(List.of(case1), List.of(case2), List.of(case3));\r\nSystem.out.println(allCommonSubsequences);\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[B], [B, C], [A, C], [E], [B, E], [A]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only problem left is how to use a common subsequence to merge `N` list of task. It will be basically the same as in the 3 lists case. You have to loop for each element in the subsequence, use the element to divide the lists into the form `p1, m1, p2, m2, ...` and put them in a `ParallelTask`. Please let me know if you want further help about this.\r\n\r\nAnd you may want to edit the calculation in `MergedTask.resources(...)` to divide by `N` instead of 3. \r\n\r\n","title":"Merge Tasks Without Overlapping","body":"<p>this will be a long post, I will try to make it as easy to understand as possible.

The sequences can be &quot;merged&quot; so that some common tasks can be executed together to reduce time and resources. But usually, there are many ways to merge. You are finding the way that gives the best in terms of</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Maximum possible merge points</li>\n<li>Maximum possible parallel execution</li>\n<li>Least number of steps to be executed altogether</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This can be viewed as an optimization problem in which you are trying to minimize the <strong>cost</strong> of <strong>resources</strong> and <strong>duration</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>resources</strong> (steps): you want to have the least number of steps and this has the same meaning as the &quot;maximum possible merge points&quot; (because the more tasks you merge, the fewer steps you have. This can be the number of the square box in the picture when each task use <code>resources = 1</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>duration</strong>: you want the &quot;maximum parallel execution&quot;, but I still find it a bit uncleared about how to measure. So I guess you actually want the tasks to be done as fast as possible, which means you want to minimize the total duration, which can be the number of horizontal rows in the picture when each row represents <code>duration = 1</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can observe that the state of the input (before merging) is where you already have the minimum <strong>duration</strong> (maximum parallel execution) but maximum <strong>resources</strong>. This means our merging algorithm can only do 2 things.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>(Bad) Make the <strong>duration</strong> increase or stay the same.</li>\n<li>(Good) Make the <strong>resources</strong> decrease or stay the same.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In other words, we are going to reduce the <strong>resources</strong> at the cost of making the tasks take a longer time to complete. We cannot determine which solution is the best until we define the final <strong>cost</strong> in terms of these 2 factors. For example, one may prefer to have as minimum resources as possible regardless of the duration, others may prefer differently.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>cost</strong>: for the sake of simplicity, I will use, as an example here, the definition <code>cost = resources * duration</code>, which can be thought of as the money you pay for <code>resources</code> number of workers by the <code>duration</code> they work.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>goal</strong>: So the goal of this optimization is to find the way to merge 3 task sequences that give the minimum cost = <code>resources * duration</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Solution Overview</h1>\n<p>The nature of this problem is very similar to the well-known <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)</a>. We can say that each possible merging result is a one-to-one correspondence to a common subsequence of the 3 task lists. But unlike the LCS problem, we cannot say the longest one is the best for us. Instead, we have to find all possible common subsequences and calculate their corresponding <code>cost</code>, then choose the one with the least <code>cost</code>.</p>\n<h1>Implemetation</h1>\n<h2>Code Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>Before talking in detail about LCS, let first translate the problem into code.</p>\n<h3>Task</h3>\n<p>A task is a unit that holds the <code>duration</code> and <code>resources</code> we are going to optimize. It usually has a <code>run()</code> method to define what it is supposed to do. The <code>id</code> is here because we have to identify and equalize them. Here if 2 tasks have the same <code>id</code>, I will treat them as the same task.</p>\n<pre><code>abstract class Task {\n    public abstract String id();\n    public abstract void run();\n    public abstract int duration();\n    public abstract int resources();\n    public int cost() {\n        return this.duration() * this.resources();\n    };\n\n     /**\n     * Just a convenient method to create a task with a one-liner\n     */\n    static Task of(String id, int duration, int resource, Runnable execution) {\n        return new Task() {\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                execution.run();\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public int duration() {\n                return duration;\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public int resources() {\n                return resource;\n            }\n\n            @Override\n            public String id() {\n                return id;\n            }\n        };\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is how the tasks are prepared.

Its <code>run()</code> method executes all task lists in parallel. But each task in a specific list still is executed in sequence. It also aggregates the <code>duration</code> and <code>resources</code> of its underlying tasks. The <code>duration</code> of a parallel task will equal the <code>duration</code> of the longest list.

So it will be another level difficult to write code that can handle <code>N</code> list.</p>\n<p>But I think maybe we can use another way. We can first find all common subsequences of the first two lists. And then combine the result with the rest <code>N-2</code> lists and find their common subsequences recursively.</p>\n<p>I have added an example code for this idea in the <code>/improved</code> folder of the original code on my Github.</p>\n<p>I created a class <code>CommonSubsequenceFinder</code>, like this</p>\n<pre><code>public class CommonSubsequenceFinder {\n    public &lt;T&gt; Set&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; findAllIn2Lists(List&lt;T&gt; l1, List&lt;T&gt; l2) {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    public &lt;T&gt; Set&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; findAllInNList(List&lt;T&gt; ... listArray) {\n        if (listArray.length &lt;= 1) {\n            return new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\n        }\n\n        List&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; lists = Arrays.asList(listArray);\n\n        List&lt;T&gt; firstList = lists.get(0);\n        List&lt;T&gt; secondList = lists.get(1);\n\n        Set&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; commonSubsequences = findAllIn2Lists(firstList, secondList);\n\n        if (commonSubsequences.isEmpty()) {\n            return commonSubsequences;\n        }\n\n        if (lists.size() == 2) {\n            return commonSubsequences;\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(commonSubsequences);\n\n        Set&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; commonSubsequencesEx = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\n        List&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; theRest = lists.subList(2, lists.size());\n        for (List&lt;T&gt; subSeq : commonSubsequences) {\n            List&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; l = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n            l.add(subSeq);\n            l.addAll(theRest);\n            commonSubsequencesEx.addAll(findAllInNList(l.toArray(new List[l.size()])));\n        }\n\n        return commonSubsequencesEx;\n    }\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the class, you will find two public methods <code>findAllIn2Lists(...)</code> and <code>findAllInNList(...)</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>findAllIn2Lists(...)</code> can find all common subsequences of 2 lists. I make it to support a generic type, you can put the list of anything not limited to just a <code>Task</code>, but with a note that the class must implement method <code>equals(...)</code> and <code>hashCode(...)</code> properly. For example, I have added the methods in <code>Task</code> like below, which then allow us to compare the equality of 2 tasks such as <code>t1.equals(t2)</code> and it will return <code>true</code> if <code>t1</code> and <code>t2</code> have the same <code>id</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>abstract class Task {\n    public abstract String id();\n    public abstract void run();\n    public abstract int duration();\n    public abstract int resources();\n    public int cost() {\n        return this.duration() * this.resources();\n    };\n    \n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return this.id();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean equals(Object o) {\n        if (this == o) return true;\n        if (o == null) return false;\n        if (o instanceof Task t) {\n            return id().equals(t.id());\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int hashCode() {\n        return Objects.hash(id());\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another method in <code>CommonSubsequenceFinder</code> is <code>findAllInNList(...)</code>. This is the aforementioned recursive method. You can put following code in the main method to see its result.</p>\n<pre><code>Set&lt;List&lt;Task&gt;&gt; allCommonSubsequences = new CommonSubsequenceFinder().findAllInNList(List.of(case1), List.of(case2), List.of(case3));\nSystem.out.println(allCommonSubsequences);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Result:</p>\n<pre><code>[[B], [B, C], [A, C], [E], [B, E], [A]]\n</code></pre>\n<p>The only problem left is how to use a common subsequence to merge <code>N</code> list of task. It will be basically the same as in the 3 lists case. You have to loop for each element in the subsequence, use the element to divide the lists into the form <code>p1, m1, p2, m2, ...</code> and put them in a <code>ParallelTask</code>. Please let me know if you want further help about this.</p>\n<p>And you may want to edit the calculation in <code>MergedTask.resources(...)</code> to divide by <code>N</code> instead of 3.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":8869159,"reputation":23,"user_id":6623340,"display_name":"Anish Aravind"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":254,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":70286146,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1639090154,"creation_date":1638857918,"question_id":70255677,"body_markdown":"I have a use case where I have different&#160;sets of tasks&#160;that must be completed in a specific order based on the situation.

every specification version you can define a `header` like one of the possible [parameter locations](https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-object).\r\n\r\nSo, one possible solution, will be to define the header in the methods you required in the request `parameters` sections:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nparameters:\r\n    -\r\n        name: X-Forwarded-For\r\n        description: X-Formarwed-For header.\r\n        schema:\r\n            type: string\r\n        in: header\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, in JSON notation:\r\n\r\n```son\r\n    &quot;parameters&quot;: [\r\n        {\r\n            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;X-Forwarded-For&quot;,\r\n            &quot;description&quot;: &quot;X-Formarwed-For header.&quot;,\r\n            &quot;schema&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            &quot;in&quot;: &quot;header&quot;\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am aware that perhaps it is a less maintainable solution because you will need to include the header in every request, but maybe you could mitigate that fact with inheritance in your services implementation.\r\n\r\nThere is an open [Github issue](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/8321) asking for the behavior you described, handling the header processing in a general way.\r\n\r\nOne suitable option, suggested as well in [this related SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70182150/13942448), could be modifying the [Mustache templates](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/master/modules/swagger-codegen/src/main/resources/JavaJaxRS) used in the API code generation and include within them the required headers processing. Please, be aware that this will do your code less maintainable and you will have the risk of perform some change that breaks the compatibility with the official Swagger Codegen repository. I am not sure in Swagger Codegen, but in the OpenAPI generator there is an option to override the used templates without modifying the actual provided in the official distribution. Please, see [this related SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65176620/openapigenerator-how-can-i-skip-generating-file-changes-because-of-a-version-c/65588090#65588090).\r\n\r\nAlthough it seems that is no longer the case, at least in older versions of Jersey in which the class was `public`, you could try accessing the `requestContext` internal variable in `org.glassfish.jersey.server.internal.process.SecurityContextInjectee` by reflection as well, although I think that workaround makes your application very implementation dependent. In any case, perhaps you could define an utility method like this that you could reuse in your services implementation:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static String getXForwardedForHeaderValue(final SecurityContext securityContext) {\r\n  SecurityContextInjectee securityContextImpl = (SecurityContextInjectee) securityContext;\r\n  Field requestContextField = SecurityContextInjectee.class.getDeclaredField(&quot;requestContext&quot;);\r\n  requestContextField.setAccessible(true);\r\n  ContainerRequestContext requestContext = requestContextField.get(securityContextImpl);\r\n  String xForwardedForHeaderValue = requestContext.getHeaderString(&quot;X-Forwarded-For&quot;);\r\n  return xForwardedForHeaderValue;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, another possibility could be using a [filter](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/documentation/latest/filters-and-interceptors.html) that process your header. If required you could pass the header value using for instance a thread local variable to the underlying services. The idea would be something like the following.\r\n\r\nFirst, define a convenient object that wraps your `ThreadLocal` value:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class XForwardedForHeaderHolder{\r\n\r\n    private static final ThreadLocal&lt;String&gt; value = new ThreadLocal&lt;String&gt;();\r\n\r\n    public static void setXForwardedForHeader(String xForwardedFor) {\r\n        value.set(xForwardedFor);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static String getXForwardedForHeader() {\r\n        return value.get();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void clean() {\r\n        value.remove();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, create a `ContainerRequestFilter`. This filter will read header from the information received in the HTTP request being processed:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport java.io.IOException;\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.container.ContainerRequestContext;\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.container.ContainerRequestFilter;\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.Response;\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.core.SecurityContext;\r\nimport javax.ws.rs.ext.Provider;\r\n \r\n@Provider\r\npublic class XForwardedForHeaderRequestFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter {\r\n \r\n    @Override\r\n    public void filter(ContainerRequestContext requestContext)\r\n        throws IOException {\r\n \r\n        String xForwardedForHeaderValue = requestContext.getHeaderString(&quot;X-Forwarded-For&quot;);\r\n        XForwardedForHeaderHolder.setXForwardedForHeader(\r\n            xForwardedForHeaderValue\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, consume the value in your services implementation:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString xForwardedForHeaderValue = XForwardedForHeaderHolder.getXForwardedForHeader();\r\n// Clean up\r\nXForwardedForHeaderHolder.clean();\r\n```\r\n\r\nA word of caution: on one hand, the filter registration should work properly but it could depend on the JAXRS version you are using and Swagger itself; on the other, the solution assume that the filter will provide, in the thread local variable, the right header for every request to the underlying services, in other words, that there are not any threading related issue. I think it should be the case, but it is something that need to be tested.","title":"How to access request headers on JAXRS classes generated by Swagger Codegen","body":"<p>In every specification version you can define a <code>header</code> like one of the possible <a href=\"https://swagger.io/specification/#parameter-object\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">parameter locations</a>.</p>\n<p>So, one possible solution, will be to define the header in the methods you required in the request <code>parameters</code> sections:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-yaml prettyprint-override\"><code>parameters:\n    -\n        name: X-Forwarded-For\n        description: X-Formarwed-For header.\n        schema:\n            type: string\n        in: header\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or, in JSON notation:</p>\n<pre><code>    &quot;parameters&quot;: [\n        {\n            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;X-Forwarded-For&quot;,\n            &quot;description&quot;: &quot;X-Formarwed-For header.&quot;,\n            &quot;schema&quot;: {\n                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;\n            },\n            &quot;in&quot;: &quot;header&quot;\n        }\n    ]\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am aware that perhaps it is a less maintainable solution because you will need to include the header in every request, but maybe you could mitigate that fact with inheritance in your services implementation.</p>\n<p>There is an open <a href=\"https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/8321\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Github issue</a> asking for the behavior you described, handling the header processing in a general way.</p>\n<p>One suitable option, suggested as well in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/70182150/13942448\">this related SO answer</a>, could be modifying the <a href=\"https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/master/modules/swagger-codegen/src/main/resources/JavaJaxRS\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mustache templates</a> used in the API code generation and include within them the required headers processing.

Takes about 3-5seconds to execute\n\n    toast.hide();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To add to my misery, even after the \"Toast\" has been disposed, the application is becoming dreadfully slow. I am pretty sure that the slowing down is not because of the operation in question, since its working perfectly if I do away with the \"Toast\".</p>\n\n<p>Can somebody please point out what is wrong here???</p>\n\n<p>I went through <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2668790/equivalent-to-androids-toast-or-mac-osx-growl-in-java-swing\">this question</a>. But the things there are far too complicated than what I am looking for. What I am looking for is a simple dialog. Not a full blown frame which needs to accommodate several components.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","maven","netbeans","pom.xml"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1223835,"reputation":75858,"user_id":1189885,"accept_rate":43,"display_name":"chrylis -cautiouslyoptimistic-"},"score":0,"creation_date":1469546671,"post_id":38593906,"comment_id":64576070,"body_markdown":"You should fill in the dependency.","body":"You should fill in the dependency."},{"owner":{"account_id":5962982,"reputation":309,"user_id":4687571,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"Jaromando"},"score":0,"creation_date":1469546804,"post_id":38593906,"comment_id":64576168,"body_markdown":"I did have it filled in and removed it to see if the error still occurred and it did.

Therefore, this combination is not recommended.\r\n\r\nIt is SBDG `1.5.6` that is [based on][2] *Spring Boot* `2.5.6`, and the latest version in the *Spring Boot* `2.5.x` / SBDG `1.5.x` release series is currently, [`1.5.7`][3] (with *Spring Boot* [`2.5.7`][4]).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you should also prefer to be on the latest maintenance/patch release (e.g. [`1.2.13.RELEASE`][5]; the last patch release in the `1.2` release series) for any *major.minor* version (e.g. `1.2`).\r\n\r\nPresumably, you are still on SBDG `1.2`, even though it is [**now EOL**][6], because you have a GemFire `9.8` cluster (?), on which SBDG `1.2` [is based][7]. Or, in your case, presumably the version of the PCC cluster in PCF is based on GemFire `9.8`??\r\n\r\nFinally, you can review all of this information in the SBDG Wiki, [Version Compatibility Matrix][8].\r\n\r\nAs an aside, this problem is not unlike the problem @rupweb had in this question, [&quot;*spring data geode pool is not resolvable as a Pool in the application context*&quot;][9].\r\n\r\nHowever, this problem is also fundamentally different inside a PCC context, particularly when using SBDG. SBDG derives the PCC cluster (Locators/Servers) connection metadata for the client (the SBDG app) from the PCC environment, namely from VCAP application &amp; service environment variables. It then proceeds in [configuring][10] the *Locators* of all Pools defined. The [SDG property][11] generally refers to all Pools created, which is simply the &quot;DEFAULT&quot; Pool when setting up the `ClientCache` to begin with.  Of course, the property can be specialized for specific &quot;named&quot; Pools (see [here][12]), however, this is not usually necessary.\r\n\r\nAnyway, you can go on to [see][13] in ***Spring Data for Apache Geode*** [and optionally, VMware Tanzu GemFire] (SDG) specifically, in the `2.2.0.RELEASE`, on which SBDG `1.2.0.RELEASE` [is based][14], that the &quot;DEFAULT&quot; Pool is initialized from the `spring.data.gemfire.pool.locators` property setup by SBDG when the app is deployed to PCF, connecting to a PCC cluster.\r\n\r\nIt is GemFire/Geode itself that sets up a &quot;DEFAULT&quot; `Pool` when a `ClientCache` instance is created (which SBDG *auto-configures* by default; see [here][15]).\r\n\r\nHowever, this can be disrupted for 2 reasons (possibly others):\r\n\r\n1) First, if you explicitly declared the SDG `@ClientCacheApplication` annotation on your `@SpringBootApplication` class, or another Spring `@Configuration` class, then you effectively override the *auto-configuration*. Don&#39;t do this when using SBDG. If you need to customize the `ClientCache` configuration, use appropriate properties in `application.properties.`\r\n\r\n2) If you explicitly define/declare a `Pool` (bean) yourself, then GemFire/Geode forgoes the creation of a &quot;DEFAULT&quot; `Pool`.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is hard to say what is going on for sure since you have not shared any snippets of your application configuration.\r\n\r\nI know that the auto-configuration for SDG/GemFire/Geode CQ provided by SBDG works correctly given this [Integration Test][16] in the SBDG test suite.\r\n\r\n&gt; NOTE: There is nothing particularly special about the [imported][17] STDG `ClientServerIntegerationTestsConfiguration` class ([here][18]) used by the GemFire client test configuration, other than coordinating the `CacheServer` port and client `Pool` port accordingly, given the port is dynamically generated. The client also connects directly to the `CacheServer` in the test, which is of no consequence.\r\n\r\nYou can also try 1 of 2 things:\r\n\r\n1) First, you can explicitly define a `Pool` bean with the name &quot;DEFAULT&quot;, like so:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Configuration\r\n@EnablePool(name = &quot;DEFAULT&quot;)\r\nclass AdditionalGemFireConfiguration {\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy using SDG&#39;s `@EnablePool` annotation, named &quot;DEFAULT&quot;, it will make sure a `Pool` by the name &quot;DEFAULT&quot; exists. And, because SBDG generically refers to all Pools (using the property `spring.data.gemfire.pool.locators`), then the &quot;DEFAULT&quot; `Pool` should pick up the configuration coming from SBDG, which again, comes from the VCAP environment inside PCF when using PCC.\r\n\r\n2) Alternatively, you can configure a `BeanPostProcessor` to customize the SDG `ContinuousQueryListenerContainer` bean *auto-configured* by SBDG, and set the custom `Pool` name, accordingly.\r\n\r\nBoth of these approaches should not be necessary when using the SBDG project and following the conventions described in the [docs][19] (also [see][20]).\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s start with this information, and iterate if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/blob/1.2.x/gradle.properties#L9\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/blob/1.5.6/gradle.properties#L11\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/blob/1.5.7/gradle.properties#L20\r\n  [4]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/blob/1.5.7/gradle.properties#L11\r\n  [5]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/blob/1.2.13.RELEASE/gradle.properties#L18\r\n  [6]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode#learn\r\n  [7]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/blob/1.2.x/gradle.properties#L7\r\n  [8]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/wiki/Spring-Boot-for-Apache-Geode-and-VMware-Tanzu-GemFire-Version-Compatibility-Matrix#version-compatibility-matrix\r\n  [9]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70025183/spring-data-geode-pool-is-not-resolvable-as-a-pool-in-the-application-context\r\n  [10]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/blob/1.2.0.RELEASE/spring-geode-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/ClientSecurityAutoConfiguration.java#L202-L207\r\n  [11]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/blob/1.2.0.RELEASE/spring-geode-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/ClientSecurityAutoConfiguration.java#L113\r\n  [12]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/geode/docs/current/reference/html/#bootstrap-annotation-config-properties\r\n  [13]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-geode/blob/2.2.0.RELEASE/src/main/java/org/springframework/data/gemfire/config/annotation/ClientCacheConfiguration.java#L127-L148\r\n  [14]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/blob/1.2.0.RELEASE/gradle.properties#L10-L11\r\n  [15]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot-data-geode-build/current/reference/html5/#geode-clientcache-applications\r\n  [16]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/blob/1.2.0.RELEASE/spring-geode-autoconfigure/src/test/java/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/cq/AutoConfiguredContinuousQueryIntegrationTests.java\r\n  [17]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/blob/1.2.0.RELEASE/spring-geode-autoconfigure/src/test/java/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/cq/AutoConfiguredContinuousQueryIntegrationTests.java#L126\r\n  [18]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-test-data-geode/blob/main/spring-data-geode-test/src/main/java/org/springframework/data/gemfire/tests/integration/config/ClientServerIntegrationTestsConfiguration.java\r\n  [19]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot-data-geode-build/current/reference/html5/\r\n  [20]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot-data-geode-build/current/reference/html5/#cloudfoundry","title":"Spring Boot for GemFire - Error creating bean with name &#39;continuousQueryListenerContainer&#39;","body":"<p>First, <em><strong>Spring Boot for Apache Geode</strong></em> [and optionally, VMware Tanzu (Pivotal) GemFire] (SBDG) <code>1.2.x</code> is <a href=\"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/blob/1.2.x/gradle.properties#L9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">based on</a> <em>Spring Boot</em> <code>2.2.x</code>, not <code>2.5.x</code>!

If you need to customize the <code>ClientCache</code> configuration, use appropriate properties in <code>application.properties.</code></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you explicitly define/declare a <code>Pool</code> (bean) yourself, then GemFire/Geode forgoes the creation of a &quot;DEFAULT&quot; <code>Pool</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, it is hard to say what is going on for sure since you have not shared any snippets of your application configuration.</p>\n<p>I know that the auto-configuration for SDG/GemFire/Geode CQ provided by SBDG works correctly given this <a href=\"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/blob/1.2.0.RELEASE/spring-geode-autoconfigure/src/test/java/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/cq/AutoConfiguredContinuousQueryIntegrationTests.java\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Integration Test</a> in the SBDG test suite.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NOTE: There is nothing particularly special about the <a href=\"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot-data-geode/blob/1.2.0.RELEASE/spring-geode-autoconfigure/src/test/java/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/cq/AutoConfiguredContinuousQueryIntegrationTests.java#L126\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">imported</a> STDG <code>ClientServerIntegerationTestsConfiguration</code> class (<a href=\"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-test-data-geode/blob/main/spring-data-geode-test/src/main/java/org/springframework/data/gemfire/tests/integration/config/ClientServerIntegrationTestsConfiguration.java\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) used by the GemFire client test configuration, other than coordinating the <code>CacheServer</code> port and client <code>Pool</code> port accordingly, given the port is dynamically generated. The client also connects directly to the <code>CacheServer</code> in the test, which is of no consequence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can also try 1 of 2 things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, you can explicitly define a <code>Pool</code> bean with the name &quot;DEFAULT&quot;, like so:</li>\n</ol>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@Configuration\n@EnablePool(name = &quot;DEFAULT&quot;)\nclass AdditionalGemFireConfiguration {\n  // ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>By using SDG's <code>@EnablePool</code> annotation, named &quot;DEFAULT&quot;, it will make sure a <code>Pool</code> by the name &quot;DEFAULT&quot; exists. And, because SBDG generically refers to all Pools (using the property <code>spring.data.gemfire.pool.locators</code>), then the &quot;DEFAULT&quot; <code>Pool</code> should pick up the configuration coming from SBDG, which again, comes from the VCAP environment inside PCF when using PCC.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Alternatively, you can configure a <code>BeanPostProcessor</code> to customize the SDG <code>ContinuousQueryListenerContainer</code> bean <em>auto-configured</em> by SBDG, and set the custom <code>Pool</code> name, accordingly.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both of these approaches should not be necessary when using the SBDG project and following the conventions described in the <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot-data-geode-build/current/reference/html5/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">docs</a> (also <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot-data-geode-build/current/reference/html5/#cloudfoundry\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see</a>).</p>\n<p>Let's start with this information, and iterate if necessary.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":6481750,"reputation":73,"user_id":5018518,"display_name":"pawan kumar"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":344,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":70190532,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1639072254,"creation_date":1638324876,"question_id":70178372,"body_markdown":"I am using spring boot 2.5.6 and integrating gemfire with it.\r\n\r\nGetting exception while deploying the application on PCF as:\r\n\r\n**Error creating bean with name &#39;continuousQueryListenerContainer&#39; defined in class path resource [org/springframework/data/gemfire/config/annotation/ContinuousQueryConfiguration.class]: Invocation of init method failed; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No Pool with name [DEFAULT] was found**\r\n\r\ndependency which I am using to support gemfire is:\r\n```&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.geode&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-gemfire-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;version&gt;1.2.0.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n","title":"Spring Boot for GemFire - Error creating bean with name &#39;continuousQueryListenerContainer&#39;","body":"<p>I am using spring boot 2.5.6 and integrating gemfire with it.</p>\n<p>Getting exception while deploying the application on PCF as:</p>\n<p><strong>Error creating bean with name 'continuousQueryListenerContainer' defined in class path resource [org/springframework/data/gemfire/config/annotation/ContinuousQueryConfiguration.class]: Invocation of init method failed; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No Pool with name [DEFAULT] was found</strong></p>\n<p>dependency which I am using to support gemfire is:</p>\n<pre><code>            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.geode&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-gemfire-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;version&gt;1.2.0.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","swagger-ui","openapi","springfox"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":23586932,"reputation":91,"user_id":17625277,"display_name":"Santhoshi Rapolu"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1639072206,"creation_date":1639072206,"answer_id":70294479,"question_id":68251247,"body_markdown":"Try using the springdoc instead of springfox.

The code works fine in *Eclipse*. But when exported to a **runnable .jar** file the resulting .jar executable can only modify a file that it itself created (created because it didn&#39;t exist before). If I then close and re-launch the .jar as a new instance to modify the file it created last launch I get\r\n&gt;     java.io.FileNotFoundException: Data.txt (Access is denied)\r\n&gt;         at java.base/java.io.FileOutputStream.open0(Native Method)\r\n&gt;         at java.base/java.io.FileOutputStream.open(FileOutputStream.java:293)\r\n&gt;         at java.base/java.io.FileOutputStream.&lt;init&gt;(FileOutputStream.java:235)\r\n&gt;         at java.base/java.io.FileOutputStream.&lt;init&gt;(FileOutputStream.java:184)\r\n&gt;         at java.base/java.io.PrintWriter.&lt;init&gt;(PrintWriter.java:309)\r\n&gt;         at project.file.LocalStorageFile.setList(LocalStorageFile.java:136)\r\n&gt;         ...\r\n\r\nSo to reiterate:\r\n1.
