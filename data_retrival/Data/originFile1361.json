I&#39;m using `Intent` and `ShortcutManager` API to pin shortcuts for devices with Android 7.1.2 and below and for Android 8.0 and above respectively.\r\n\r\nEverything worked fine until Xiaomi released MIUI 9. I tested my app on stock Android and on a Samsung one and it worked fine. It worked fine even with MIUI 8. Let me describe the issue I&#39;m facing in MIUI 9.\r\n\r\nIn MIUI 9, the shortcut is pinned to Home Screen successfully and there&#39;s no issue till this step. But when I try to open the shortcut, it says **Can&#39;t start launcher**. This error most probably means that OS couldn&#39;t find an app to open the file. But there&#39;s an inbuilt PDF reader in all the devices I tested. I even installed Adobe Reader and a couple of other PDF readers and still, it didn&#39;t work. Here&#39;s the culprit code:\r\n\r\n    private void addShortcut(String path1, String pdfName) {\r\n            File file = new File(path1);\r\n            if (file.exists()) {\r\n                Uri path = Uri.fromFile(file);\r\n                Intent shortcutIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);\r\n                shortcutIntent.setDataAndType(path, &quot;application/pdf&quot;);\r\n                Intent addIntent = new Intent();\r\n                addIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SHORTCUT_INTENT, shortcutIntent);\r\n                addIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SHORTCUT_NAME, pdfName);\r\n                addIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SHORTCUT_ICON_RESOURCE,\r\n                        Intent.ShortcutIconResource.fromContext(this.getApplicationContext(),image));\r\n                addIntent.setAction(&quot;com.android.launcher.action.INSTALL_SHORTCUT&quot;);\r\n                getApplicationContext().sendBroadcast(addIntent);\r\n            } else {\r\n                Toast.makeText(this, &quot;Some error occurred!&quot;, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nSince the code is working fine on Stock Android and many custom skins, I assume it&#39;s not the issue with my code. It&#39;s there something with MIUI 9. I have explored the whole web but there&#39;s no documentation or something related to this issue on Xiaomi&#39;s website or any other.\r\n\r\nI have done lots of debugging and found out:\r\n\r\n - When I don&#39;t set a data-type in the code and opens the shortcut, it asks me for an app to open the shortcut.

I'm using <code>Intent</code> and <code>ShortcutManager</code> API to pin shortcuts for devices with Android 7.1.2 and below and for Android 8.0 and above respectively.</p>\n<p>Everything worked fine until Xiaomi released MIUI 9. I tested my app on stock Android and on a Samsung one and it worked fine. It worked fine even with MIUI 8. Let me describe the issue I'm facing in MIUI 9.</p>\n<p>In MIUI 9, the shortcut is pinned to Home Screen successfully and there's no issue till this step. But when I try to open the shortcut, it says <strong>Can't start launcher</strong>. This error most probably means that OS couldn't find an app to open the file. But there's an inbuilt PDF reader in all the devices I tested. I even installed Adobe Reader and a couple of other PDF readers and still, it didn't work. Here's the culprit code:</p>\n<pre><code>private void addShortcut(String path1, String pdfName) {\n        File file = new File(path1);\n        if (file.exists()) {\n            Uri path = Uri.fromFile(file);\n            Intent shortcutIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);\n            shortcutIntent.setDataAndType(path, &quot;application/pdf&quot;);\n            Intent addIntent = new Intent();\n            addIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SHORTCUT_INTENT, shortcutIntent);\n            addIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SHORTCUT_NAME, pdfName);\n            addIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SHORTCUT_ICON_RESOURCE,\n                    Intent.ShortcutIconResource.fromContext(this.getApplicationContext(),image));\n            addIntent.setAction(&quot;com.android.launcher.action.INSTALL_SHORTCUT&quot;);\n            getApplicationContext().sendBroadcast(addIntent);\n        } else {\n            Toast.makeText(this, &quot;Some error occurred!&quot;, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since the code is working fine on Stock Android and many custom skins, I assume it's not the issue with my code. It's there something with MIUI 9. I have explored the whole web but there's no documentation or something related to this issue on Xiaomi's website or any other.</p>\n<p>I have done lots of debugging and found out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When I don't set a data-type in the code and opens the shortcut, it asks me for an app to open the shortcut. Then I choose, for example, &quot;Adobe Reader&quot; and it still doesn't work. Adobe Reader opens but doesn't open the file. I get a toolbar with title &quot;Adobe Reader&quot; and white screen below that.

Or maybe it's because I'm using <code>jenv</code> to set my java version, and that doesn't work with the forked process.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4809840,"reputation":172,"user_id":3883629,"display_name":"Ry.xn"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1652163380,"creation_date":1652163380,"answer_id":72181490,"question_id":51401955,"body_markdown":"I was working on a legacy project and I came across the same issue.

Please, see the following example (for simplicity, let&#39;s consider the new type immutable):\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage slartidan.sqlserverspatial;\r\n\r\nimport java.sql.PreparedStatement;\r\nimport java.sql.ResultSet;\r\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\r\nimport java.sql.Types;\r\n\r\nimport org.hibernate.engine.spi.SharedSessionContractImplementor;\r\nimport org.springframework.data.geo.Point;\r\n\r\nimport com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.Geography;\r\n\r\npublic class SQLServerGeographyType\r\n    extends ImmutableType&lt;Point&gt;

If you insist on having a test, skipping `verify()` is probably alright, because the method above has **no other way of getting a value** than by calling the function you would be `verify`ing, and it returns that value, so it could hardly call it more than once.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if your function looks like:\r\n\r\n\r\n    public int count() {\r\n        // get a personService from an injector\r\n        // log the personService&#39;s details\r\n        // generate a random number\r\n        // try calling count() on personService, catch an error\r\n        // if you caught the error, return the random number\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen maybe you **do** want to `verify()` because all of a sudden, there are a lot of things going on and some of them (i.e. the random number) could be confused for correct functioning even if something is going horribly wrong.

A Primitive is simply any variable of a primitive type, and there are only 8 hardcoded primitive types: `long`, `int`, `short`, `byte`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and `boolean`. All primitives variables represent their actual value. For example, given:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid foo(boolean x) {\r\n  int y = 5;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe stack frame when you&#39;re in the middle of that method contains 1 boolean value (generally just represented by a whole word&#39;s worth of bits, modern CPU architecture kinda dictates you do it that way), and 1 int value. If you were to call, say, `foo(x, 10)` in that method, and let&#39;s say `x` was true, then the stack would contain `true`, `5`, `true`, `10`. Java is pass-by-value, always.\r\n\r\nBut references are, in C terms, just pointers. They are one &#39;word&#39; in size effectively, and it&#39;s a number that the JVM can use to look up an object.\r\n\r\n__All objects live on the heap__, meaning, there&#39;s just the one copy unless you explicitly make clones or more objects. `.` dereferences the reference and will get you to the object on heap. Only objects have fields, and thus, all fields live on heap, too.\r\n\r\nHence:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid test() {\r\n  List&lt;String&gt; x = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();\r\n  x.add(&quot;Hello&quot;);\r\n  foo(x);\r\n  System.out.println(x); // THIS LINE WILL PRINT...\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid foo(List&lt;String&gt; x) {\r\n  x.add(&quot;World!&quot;); // dereference pointer.\r\n  x = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); // Overwrite local var\r\n  x.add(&quot;Goodbye&quot;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code will actually print `[Hello, World]`. The `x` in the `foo` method is a copy (because java is pass-by-value), and local - but it&#39;s &#39;pointing&#39; at the same list that the `x`from the `test` method is. So, `x.` gets you to the same object, thus that call to `.add(&quot;World!&quot;)` is &#39;visible&#39; from the `test` method. The `foo` method then overwrites its local by creating a new object (`new`, name kinda gives it away), and assigning the reference to it to the `x` variable, overwriting the local `x`, which has no effect at all on the `x` that `test` has, which still points at the old list.\r\n\r\nThe `foo` method than invokes a method on this new list, and then the method ends, with it, the `x` variables goes away (the stack frame is popped, and poof goes the reference), and thus that list that `foo` created is now __inaccessible__: It&#39;s an object and no references exist in any code that we can ever get to. That means it&#39;ll eventually be garbage collected by the JVM.\r\n\r\nJava does not allow pointer math, you can&#39;t try to walk through the entire heap by just looping all memory addresses or some such. You can&#39;t do something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nString x = *(someAddressInMemory);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that sense, java pointers are very different from C pointers: &quot;Pointer math&quot; is simply not allowed; if you tried, the JVM class verifier would not let you. Hence, to avoid confusing, java uses the name &#39;reference&#39; for the concept. It&#39;s the same thing as a pointer. Just, hopefully without the baggage.\r\n\r\nThat does mean that if you invoke the same method, __and pass a reference to the same object__, in multiple threads, they&#39;ll walk all over themselves and cause all sorts of trouble if they actually modify it. If you make __1 list__, then in 5 threads you simultaneously call the same method 5 times, __handing that one list to all of them__, and that method calls, say, `.add(&quot;Hello&quot;)` on it, all heck breaks loose.\r\n\r\nSo don&#39;t do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"Calling a method when a previous call to the same method is still executing","body":"<p>Java has 'local' variables, parameters (which are almost entirely identical to locals), and 'fields'.</p>\n<p><strong>All local variables exist on stack</strong>.</p>\n<p>That means all java methods are inherently reentrant (you can call them from themselves, i.e. recursion - and each method has its own set of local vars, they aren't &quot;reused&quot;, you don't overwrite any variables from the still-on-stack recursion 'above' you), and all java methods are inherently multi-threading capable in the sense that you can invoke the same method on the same object from many different threads simultaneously, and each local var is its own copy, unique to that invocation.</p>\n<p>However.</p>\n<p>Java has 2 types of variables: Primitives and References.

The <code>foo</code> method then overwrites its local by creating a new object (<code>new</code>, name kinda gives it away), and assigning the reference to it to the <code>x</code> variable, overwriting the local <code>x</code>, which has no effect at all on the <code>x</code> that <code>test</code> has, which still points at the old list.</p>\n<p>The <code>foo</code> method than invokes a method on this new list, and then the method ends, with it, the <code>x</code> variables goes away (the stack frame is popped, and poof goes the reference), and thus that list that <code>foo</code> created is now <strong>inaccessible</strong>: It's an object and no references exist in any code that we can ever get to. That means it'll eventually be garbage collected by the JVM.</p>\n<p>Java does not allow pointer math, you can't try to walk through the entire heap by just looping all memory addresses or some such. You can't do something like:</p>\n<pre><code>String x = *(someAddressInMemory);\n</code></pre>\n<p>In that sense, java pointers are very different from C pointers: &quot;Pointer math&quot; is simply not allowed; if you tried, the JVM class verifier would not let you. Hence, to avoid confusing, java uses the name 'reference' for the concept. It's the same thing as a pointer. Just, hopefully without the baggage.</p>\n<p>That does mean that if you invoke the same method, <strong>and pass a reference to the same object</strong>, in multiple threads, they'll walk all over themselves and cause all sorts of trouble if they actually modify it. If you make <strong>1 list</strong>, then in 5 threads you simultaneously call the same method 5 times, <strong>handing that one list to all of them</strong>, and that method calls, say, <code>.add(&quot;Hello&quot;)</code> on it, all heck breaks loose.</p>\n<p>So don't do that.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":23687366,"reputation":41,"user_id":17712132,"display_name":"lanezalbryt"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":419,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1652151877,"creation_date":1652150637,"question_id":72180181,"body_markdown":"In Java what happens when a method is called when a previous call to the same method is still executing?\r\nDoes it execute typically,i.e create a different stack frame,with the local variables also local to each method call(not share it&#39;s local variables),for the new call to the method.

In general, it is best to use a single toolkit for the UI rather than mix them.\r\n\r\n**Using a JFXPanel (recommended)**\r\n\r\nFollow the [javafx swing integration documentation][1], which explains how to write the code. \r\n\r\nThe documentation I linked is a little outdated.  The code remains the same, but JavaFX was modularized and removed from most JDK distributions from JDK/JavaFX 11 on, so you need to do some additional work.\r\n\r\n * [A further example of using a JFXPanel][2], with code, on StackOverflow.\r\n\r\n**Applying a JFXPanel to an existing JavaFX application**\r\n\r\nThe javafx swing integration documentation I linked is for putting the JavaFX content in a swing panel (`JFXPanel`) but I noted that you say you cannot use such a panel in your application. I am not quite sure why you can&#39;t do that. [`JFXPanel`][3] is just a generic swing component that can hold any JavaFX scene.  The linked javadoc also shows how to use it. \r\n\r\nTo apply a `JFXPanel` to an existing JavaFX application, have the JavaFX application supply a method that provides the scene it would normally set on the primary stage in the application `start` method.  Call your new method to get the scene to embed it in your `JFXPanel` inside a frame of the Swing application.  You don&#39;t need to call `launch` on the JavaFX application with this method.\r\n\r\n**Getting JavaFX components and Modularity**\r\n\r\nTo work with a modular JavaFX, also follow the instructions at [openjfx.io][4]:\r\n\r\n *  The maven dependency required is `org.openjfx:javafx-swing:&lt;version&gt;`\r\n\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.openjfx&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;javafx-swing&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;version&gt;18&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\n *  Module info (if you need it) is:\r\n\r\n        requires javafx.swing;\r\n    \r\nModule info is only required if you are writing a modular application that provides `module-info.java`, otherwise you need to add the module to the module path for compilation and runtime via command-line switches (as outlined in the openjfx.io documentation linked).\r\n\r\nOr, you can rely on a JDK which includes both JavaFX and swing modules in the distribution and places them on the boot module path, e.g.:\r\n\r\n * [Azul Zulu &quot;JDK FX&quot;][5] (on the download link ensure you choose JDK FX).\r\n * [Bellsoft Liberica &quot;Full JDK&quot;][6] (on the download link ensure you choose Full JDK).\r\n\r\n**Launching a JavaFX application from Swing (not recommended)**\r\n\r\nAlternately you could possibly invoke the JavaFX application [`launch`][7] method directly. \r\n\r\nIf you do so, study the [application lifecycle documentation][8] on the linked javadoc. \r\n\r\nYou can only call launch once and it will block the calling thread until the JavaFX app exits. \r\n\r\nIf you want multiple, non-blocking calls you will need to do some work to use such an approach.  For example, spawn a separate execution thread to launch the application (so that you don&#39;t block the Swing thread).

This is generally easy to attain via serial thread-confinement, which often is a natural consequence of typical parallel algorithms that work by recursive decomposition. A thread calling `trySplit()` may hand over the returned `Spliterator` to another thread, which in turn may traverse or further split that `Spliterator`. The behaviour of splitting and traversal is undefined if two or more threads operate concurrently on the same spliterator. If the original thread hands a spliterator off to another thread for processing, it is best if that handoff occurs before any elements are consumed with `tryAdvance()`, as certain guarantees (such as the accuracy of `estimateSize()` for SIZED spliterators) are only valid before traversal has begun.&quot;\r\n\r\nIn other words, thread safety is a joint responsibility of the `Spliterator` implementation and `Stream` implementation.\r\n\r\nThe simple way to think about this is that &quot;magic happens&quot; ... because if it didn&#39;t then parallel streams would be unusable.\r\n\r\nBut note that the `Spliterator` is not necessarily using `ArrayList::get` at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Spliterator.html","title":"Is `ArrayList::get` thread-safe?","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>But if the <code>ArrayList</code> is not being modified is calling <code>ArrayList::get</code> thread-safe?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No it is not thread-safe.</p>\n<p>The problems arise if you do something like the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Thread A creates and populates list.</li>\n<li>Thread A passes reference to list to thread B (<strong>without a <em>happens before</em> relationship</strong>)</li>\n<li>Thread B calls <code>get</code> on the list.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unless there is a proper <em>happens before</em> chain between 1 and 3, thread B may see stale values ... occasionally ... on some platforms under certain work loads.</p>\n<p>There are ways to address this.

This is generally easy to attain via serial thread-confinement, which often is a natural consequence of typical parallel algorithms that work by recursive decomposition. A thread calling <code>trySplit()</code> may hand over the returned <code>Spliterator</code> to another thread, which in turn may traverse or further split that <code>Spliterator</code>. The behaviour of splitting and traversal is undefined if two or more threads operate concurrently on the same spliterator. If the original thread hands a spliterator off to another thread for processing, it is best if that handoff occurs before any elements are consumed with <code>tryAdvance()</code>, as certain guarantees (such as the accuracy of <code>estimateSize()</code> for SIZED spliterators) are only valid before traversal has begun.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, thread safety is a joint responsibility of the <code>Spliterator</code> implementation and <code>Stream</code> implementation.</p>\n<p>The simple way to think about this is that &quot;magic happens&quot; ... because if it didn't then parallel streams would be unusable.</p>\n<p>But note that the <code>Spliterator</code> is not necessarily using <code>ArrayList::get</code> at all.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":322981,"reputation":310745,"user_id":642706,"accept_rate":58,"display_name":"Basil Bourque"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":2416,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":3,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1652142009,"creation_date":1507327109,"question_id":46614481,"body_markdown":"I understand that modifying an [`ArrayList`][1] makes it not [thread-safe][2]. \r\n\r\n➠ But if the `ArrayList` is *not* being modified, perhaps protected by a call to [`Collections.unmodifiableList`](http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#unmodifiableList-java.util.List-), is calling [`ArrayList::get`][3] thread-safe?\r\n\r\nFor example, can an `ArrayList` be passed to a [Java Stream][4] for parallel-processing of its elements?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_safety\r\n  [3]: http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html#get-int-\r\n  [4]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html","title":"Is `ArrayList::get` thread-safe?","body":"<p>I understand that modifying an <a href=\"http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>ArrayList</code></a> makes it not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_safety\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">thread-safe</a>. </p>\n\n<p>➠ But if the <code>ArrayList</code> is <em>not</em> being modified, perhaps protected by a call to <a href=\"http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#unmodifiableList-java.util.List-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Collections.unmodifiableList</code></a>, is calling <a href=\"http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html#get-int-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>ArrayList::get</code></a> thread-safe?</p>\n\n<p>For example, can an <code>ArrayList</code> be passed to a <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Java Stream</a> for parallel-processing of its elements?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","arraylist","java-8","java-stream"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":5593781,"reputation":1739,"user_id":4788787,"accept_rate":64,"display_name":"Manu Joy"},"score":0,"creation_date":1434974651,"post_id":30977759,"comment_id":49989242,"body_markdown":"please consider the set operation (-)","body":"please consider the set operation (-)"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3251604,"reputation":1437,"user_id":2741693,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Hiren"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":14,"is_accepted":false,"score":13,"last_activity_date":1555264618,"creation_date":1434969595,"answer_id":30977850,"question_id":30977759,"body_markdown":"Try this:  \r\n\r\n    List&lt;Integer&gt;

A trigger callback, how does the caller know when a menu item is selected?\r\n\r\nWell, this is up to you now. I would...\r\n\r\n* Add an observer callback to notify the caller that some menu item has been selected/actioned\r\n* Add a key binding for the &lt;kbd&gt;Enter&lt;/kbd&gt; key and a `MouseListener` to detect when the user clicks an item - however, this is going to present you with issues, as you need to dynamically calculate the button bounds (I might consider doing this up-front).
