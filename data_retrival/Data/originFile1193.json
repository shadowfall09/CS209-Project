Feel free to add comments underneath if I need to explain more.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":11899514,"reputation":59,"user_id":8707914,"display_name":"fragilepriCe"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":727,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":72951090,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1657623050,"creation_date":1657566539,"question_id":72943510,"body_markdown":"I am building a monolith project using Axon framework.\r\n\r\nI have a method here that dispatches an event\r\n```\r\n @CommandHandler\r\n    public void createRoom(CreateRoomCommand createRoomCommand){\r\n        log.info(&quot;Receiving create room command: {}&quot;,createRoomCommand);\r\n        ChatRoom chatRoom = new ChatRoom(\r\n                createRoomCommand.getRoomId(),\r\n                createRoomCommand.getName()\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        chatRoom.create();\r\n\r\n        List&lt;DomainEvent&gt; domainEvents = chatRoom.getDomainEvents();\r\n\r\n        domainEvents.forEach(domainEvent -&gt; eventBus.publish(GenericEventMessage.asEventMessage(domainEvent)));\r\n\r\n        chatRoomRepository.save(chatRoom);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAnd this is my event handler that might throw an exception\r\n```\r\n   @EventHandler\r\n    public void on(RoomCreatedEvent event){\r\n        //throw exception here\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy question is, how should I handle the exception?\r\n\r\nI thought of two things:\r\n\r\n 1.

It is included in the JDK. Even if you use the `wsimport` tool from JDK8 it will nevertheless produce source code [that cannot be compiled with the javadoc compiler from JDK8](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24495579/jdk8-not-working-with-jdk8-ws-client).\r\n\r\n\r\n### @author tag\r\nI&#39;m opening up source code files 3-4 years old and see this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: text --&gt;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * My very best class\r\n     * @author John &lt;john.doe@mine.com&gt; \r\n     */\r\n\r\nThis now fails because of the &lt; character.

Here's my code:</p>\n<pre><code>public void Random_Word(){\n    String text = &quot;&quot;;\n    try {\n        InputStream is = getAssets().open(&quot;challenges.txt&quot;);\n        int size = is.available();\n        byte[] buffer = new byte[size];\n        is.read(buffer);\n        is.close();\n        text = new String(buffer);\n    } catch (IOException ex) {\n        ex.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    String[] separated = text.split(&quot;\\n&quot;);\n    int size = separated.length;\n    int randomNum = (int) (Math.random() * size - 1);\n    String randomWord = separated[randomNum];\n\n    word.setText(randomWord);\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","eclipse","eclipse-plugin"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1638261,"reputation":703,"user_id":1511193,"display_name":"vmrvictor"},"score":1,"creation_date":1538131659,"post_id":52553693,"comment_id":92046041,"body_markdown":"have you tried https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse ?","body":"have you tried <a href=\"https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse</a> ?"},{"owner":{"account_id":1705913,"reputation":484,"user_id":1564958,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Madhavi"},"score":0,"creation_date":1538134904,"post_id":52553693,"comment_id":92047651,"body_markdown":"No, let me try.

The reason HashMap is much faster than literally doing that is because it _also_ uses `hashCode()`: The rules of the `hashCode` method state that any 2 objects whose hashCode are different cannot be identical (note that the reverse is not true; 2 objects with identical hashCode need not be equal). Hence, hashmap first calls hashCode to reduce the search space to a tiny bucket compared to the size of the whole map, and needs to do a full loop-scan through _just_ the keys in this bucket. Usually a bucket contains just 1 object so that&#39;s great.\r\n\r\nhashCode __is not a key__ - This works:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic final class Position {\r\n  private final int x, y, layer;\r\n\r\n  // very important!\r\n\r\n  public int hashCode() {\r\n   return 1; // this is a really bad impl\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public boolean equals(Object other) {\r\n    // proper impl\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can stuff the above Position objects in a hashmap if you must, and it&#39;ll work correctly. It won&#39;t be very fast - because __all__ position objects have the same hashCode, it&#39;s 100% collisions, so the hashmap needs to loop through _all_ keys for _all_ operations. But it&#39;ll work. In the same vein, given a hashCode of position, you __cannot__ do a lookup. HashMap simply doesn&#39;t allow that, and it wouldn&#39;t know what to return even if it did (because more than one key can have that hashCode. You shouldn&#39;t - collisions are bad, but it&#39;s no problem if you have a handful).\r\n","title":"Creating or tracking classes with the same variable values","body":"<p>I think you misunderstand.</p>\n<p>Here, trivially:</p>\n<pre><code>public final class Position {\n  private final int x, y, layer;\n\n  // very important!\n\n  public int hashCode() {\n   // proper impl that mixes all 3 variables into it\n  }\n\n  public boolean equals(Object other) {\n    // proper impl\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then:</p>\n<pre><code>Map&lt;Position, List&lt;Entity&gt;&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\nPosition p1 = new Position(1, 2, 5);\nPosition p2 = new Position(1, 2, 5);\nSystem.out.println(p1 == p2); // false, as expected.\nmap.put(p1, List.of());\nSystem.out.println(map.get(p2)); // prints an empty list, NOT null!\nmap.put(p2, List.of());\nSystem.out.println(map.size()); // 1, not 2!\n</code></pre>\n<p>The map impl <strong>already loops through all keys and compares them with <code>equals</code></strong> - you don't <em>also</em> have to do that. The reason HashMap is much faster than literally doing that is because it <em>also</em> uses <code>hashCode()</code>: The rules of the <code>hashCode</code> method state that any 2 objects whose hashCode are different cannot be identical (note that the reverse is not true; 2 objects with identical hashCode need not be equal). Hence, hashmap first calls hashCode to reduce the search space to a tiny bucket compared to the size of the whole map, and needs to do a full loop-scan through <em>just</em> the keys in this bucket. Usually a bucket contains just 1 object so that's great.</p>\n<p>hashCode <strong>is not a key</strong> - This works:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public final class Position {\n  private final int x, y, layer;\n\n  // very important!\n\n  public int hashCode() {\n   return 1; // this is a really bad impl\n  }\n\n  public boolean equals(Object other) {\n    // proper impl\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can stuff the above Position objects in a hashmap if you must, and it'll work correctly. It won't be very fast - because <strong>all</strong> position objects have the same hashCode, it's 100% collisions, so the hashmap needs to loop through <em>all</em> keys for <em>all</em> operations. But it'll work. In the same vein, given a hashCode of position, you <strong>cannot</strong> do a lookup. HashMap simply doesn't allow that, and it wouldn't know what to return even if it did (because more than one key can have that hashCode.

There you would define things about the current scope, like which fields this class has or which methods.\r\nThat&#39;s why the assignment to `String outerInstanceField` works, as you are in the Scope of the `OuterClass` and are defining how it is defined.\r\n\r\nWhat you are doing in the `Innerclass` is actually dynamic, i.e. something that would be executed. But you cannot even tell, when. Is it at the time of class loading? When some object is created?
