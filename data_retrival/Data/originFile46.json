The second time and every other time after has no gap.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","servlets","ant","javac"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":183645,"reputation":3141,"user_id":419132,"accept_rate":95,"display_name":"wespiserA"},"score":0,"creation_date":1302549623,"post_id":5626317,"comment_id":6411173,"body_markdown":"please add some code, this question seems vague","body":"please add some code, this question seems vague"},{"owner":{"account_id":14531,"reputation":118860,"user_id":29995,"accept_rate":77,"display_name":"Rob Hruska"},"score":0,"creation_date":1302549746,"post_id":5626317,"comment_id":6411207,"body_markdown":"[Related](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5625589/javac-erroring-out-when-compiling-servlet-libraries)","body":"<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5625589/javac-erroring-out-when-compiling-servlet-libraries\">Related</a>"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":11683,"reputation":1438111,"user_id":22656,"accept_rate":86,"display_name":"Jon Skeet"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1302549620,"creation_date":1302549620,"answer_id":5626353,"question_id":5626317,"body_markdown":"It&#39;s a common occurrence if you don&#39;t specify the servlet libraries properly in the classpath for the `javac` task...

A way to not break your contract is make your subclass `Abstract` as well as a way of saying \r\n\r\n&gt; &quot;I have not implemented all the methods in my contract, I am going to\r\n&gt; have my subclasses implement them&quot;.\r\n\r\nFor your class `bar` right now, you must implement `b()` or make `bar` an `Abstract` class or you are not fulfilling your contract with `MyAbstractClass`\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is:\r\n\r\n**Interface:** None of my methods are implemented. A subclass must implement all my methods in order to implement me.

But they can also leave some of the methods unimplemented so the subclass can implement them. If you leave an interface method unimplemented, there is not need to declare it abstract, it is already in the contract.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n      \r\n\r\n      public abstract class myAbstractClass2 implement myInterface\r\n      {\r\n          @Override\r\n          public void methodA()\r\n          {\r\n              // this fulfills part of the contract with myInterface.\r\n              // my subclasses will not need to implement this unless they want to override\r\n              // my implementation.\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          //My subclasses must implement this to fulfill their contract with me\r\n          public abstract void methodD();\r\n      }\r\n\r\nSo in essence, an abstract class doesn&#39;t have as strict a contract with it&#39;s superclass because it can delegate its methods to its subclasses.\r\n\r\n**Regular Class**: (I use regular to mean non-interface, and non-abstract). I must implement **all** unimplemented methods from all of my superclasses. These classes have a binding contract.\r\n\r\nExample:  \r\n\r\n     public class mySubClass extends myAbstractClass2\r\n     {\r\n         @Override\r\n         public void methodB()\r\n         {\r\n             //must be implemented to fulfill contract with myInterface\r\n         }\r\n\r\n         @Override\r\n         public void methodD()\r\n         {\r\n             //must be implemented to fulfill contract with myAbstractClass2\r\n         }\r\n\r\n         public void myMethod()\r\n         {\r\n            //This is a method specifically for mySubClass. \r\n         }\r\n     }","title":"Should I implement all the methods present in an abstract class?","body":"<p>When you extend an <code>Interface</code> or an <code>Abstract</code> class you are creating a contract of sorts with that <code>superclass</code>.

I tried to use a public accessor method to get the x and y coordinates, however I got the same error message when I tried that. ...&quot;_\r\n\r\nThe _[access modifiers](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html)_ are used to define the access, when out-side of the class.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you declare the _f_ _method_ as _private_, you would not be able to access it, from the _main_ _method_.\r\n\r\nYou would receive the following _compilation error_.\r\n\r\n```none\r\njava: f() has private access in ABC\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough, the reason you&#39;re receiving the specific error you&#39;ve mentioned, is because the _xCord_ and _yCord_ are _instance fields_, and not _static fields_.\r\n\r\n&gt; _&quot;... my goal was to calculate the slope then print it out with a sentence format that included the individual coordinates that were involved in the calculation. ...&quot;_\r\n\r\nSince you&#39;re _method_ is static, you&#39;ll need two parameters; one for each _Point_.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the _[Integer#compare](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Integer.html#compare(int,int))_ _method_, and not like the _[String#compareTo](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#compareTo(java.lang.String))_ _method_.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of both.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nstatic String getSlope(Point a, Point b) {\r\n    double slope = ((a.yCord - b.yCord) / (a.xCord - b.xCord));\r\n    return &quot;The slope of the line from &quot; + &quot;(&quot; + a.xCord + &quot;, &quot; + a.yCord + &quot;)&quot; + &quot; to &quot; + &quot;(&quot; + b.xCord + &quot;, &quot; + &quot;(&quot; + b.xCord + &quot;, &quot; + b.yCord + &quot;)&quot; +  &quot;is &quot; + slope;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString getSlope(Point p) {\r\n    double slope = ((yCord - p.yCord) / (xCord - p.xCord));\r\n    return &quot;The slope of the line from &quot; + &quot;(&quot; + xCord + &quot;, &quot; + yCord + &quot;)&quot; + &quot; to &quot; + &quot;(&quot; + p.xCord + &quot;, &quot; + &quot;(&quot; + p.xCord + &quot;, &quot; + p.yCord + &quot;)&quot; +  &quot;is &quot; + slope;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, it&#39;s worth noting, I believe your arithmetic is backwards.\\\r\nA slope is typically calculated as _m = (y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) / (x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)_.\\\r\n_[Wikipedia &amp;ndash; Slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope)_.\r\n\r\nHere is a re-factor.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass Point {\r\n    double x, y;\r\n\r\n    Point(double x, double y) {\r\n        this.x = x;\r\n        this.y = y;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static String slope(Point a, Point b) {\r\n        double m = (b.y - a.y) / (b.x - a.x);\r\n        return &quot;m = (%s - %s) / (%s - %s) = %s&quot;.formatted(b.y, a.y, b.x, a.x, m);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput\r\n\r\n```none\r\nm = (8.0 - 2.0) / (13.0 - 1.0) = 0.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternately, use a _[record class](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/language/records.html)_.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nrecord Point(double x, double y) {\r\n    static String slope(Point a, Point b) {\r\n        double m = (b.y - a.y) / (b.x - a.x);\r\n        return &quot;m = (%s - %s) / (%s - %s) = %s&quot;.formatted(b.y, a.y, b.x, a.x, m);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","title":"How do I access my private variables from my static method","body":"<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;...

Since there is a `button` parameter that came from `index.jsp`, everything is OK, and it reaches the code at the end that forwards it into the `meeting_Id.jsp` which is now displayed on your browser.\r\n 3. You now click the button and send the form in the `meeting_Id.jsp` back to `MainController`.\r\n 4. Now, in this invocation, there is no parameter `button`. Therefore you get the NullPointerException.\r\n\r\nYou are working in an MVC environment. Every form is sent to the same controller, `MainContoller`, and `MainController` is supposed to be smart enough to know which form sent it the request, and handle it accordingly. But yours assumes only `index.jsp` is calling it. But it doesn&#39;t work like this. When you click the `next` button on `meeting_Id.jspa`, you are creating a **new request**, which goes to the same `MainController` servlet, and causes the error.\r\n\r\nYou should make sure your forms send some sort of ID that tells `MainController` which form is using it at the moment, and then the controller can send the request to be processed by the appropriate model. The input you use this for should have the same name and should exist in all the forms you are sending.\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Solution for the NumberFormatException&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nNow you have a similar issue for a different reason. In this line:\r\n\r\n     int meetingid = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter(&quot;meeting_id&quot;));\r\n\r\nYou are trying to parse a parameter called `meeting_id`. The problem is that, again, you are not checking for nulls. You don&#39;t actually have such a parameter.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because this is what your HTML (in `meeting_Id.jsp`) says:\r\n\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;meeting_id&quot; name=&quot;mid&quot; required=&quot;required&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\nAs you can see, &quot;meeting_id&quot; is its **id**, not its **name**, and `getParameter()` always works with the input&#39;s `name`.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, after you fix this, you must either make sure (with a regex) that the parameter has only numbers in it, or you have to catch `NumberFormatException` using a try-catch block around the `parseInt` line.\r\n\r\nAlways, always, check the parameters that you get from the user. Never assume that they exist, that they are not null, or that they have the values you expect them to have.","title":"java.lang.NumberFormatException: null java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Unknown Source)","body":"<h3>Solution for the original NullPointerException problem</h3>\n\n<p>The problem is in here:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    //System.out.println(\"connection\");\n    String button=request.getParameter(\"button\");\n    System.out.println(button +  request.getParameter(\"AId\"));\n\n\n\n\n    if(button.equals(\"login\"))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see from your own debug printing, both <code>button</code> and the parameter <code>AId</code> that you print are null.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when you try to call <code>button.equals(\"login\")</code> you get a NullPointerException.

I can do it by running the models inside the h2o cluster using the following code:</p>\n<pre><code>#load H2O Model\nh2o.init()\n\n# Download the MOJO\nmojo_path = model_mojo\nimported_model = h2o.import_mojo(mojo_path)\n\n# Run Model\nnew_observations = h2o.H2OFrame(df_prever)\npredictions = imported_model.predict(new_observations)\n\n# Save Results\npredictions = predictions.as_data_frame(predictions)\ndata_results = pd.concat([df_prever, predictions], axis=1)\ndata_results = data_results.rename(columns={&quot;predict&quot; : &quot;Predicted_Values&quot;}) \ndata_results = data_results.infer_objects()\ndata_results.to_csv(&quot;./Data_Results.csv&quot;, sep=delimiter, decimal=decimal_sep, index=False)\n</code></pre>\n<p>And I ended up with a CSV with the prediction results.</p>\n<p>The problem is that the cluster takes a long time to start in a Raspberry Pi 2. I read that running the models without a cluster is possible, but I couldn't do it.</p>\n<p>I tried to run the models without starting the cluster with no success. I even tried to let a cluster open at the boot, but it didn't work, and every time I run a script to make predictions, the cluster starts and ends when the script finalizes.</p>\n<p>Can anyone please help me with that? My models are sorted; I have deep learning, XGboost, StackedEnsemble, GBM, etc.. I have regression, multi-class, and binary classification models, so a flexible way to deal with different models is much appreciated.</p>\n<p>Below is the complete code I use to load the models with the h2o cluster.</p>\n<pre><code>import pandas as pd\nfrom pandas import read_csv\nimport h2o\n\n# User defined Variables\n\n# Data file to make predictions\ncsv_file = &quot;Data.csv&quot;\n\n# CSV parameters\ndelimiter=&quot;;&quot;\ndecimal_sep=&quot;,&quot;\nencoding=&quot;ascii&quot;\n\n# Model zip file\nmodel_mojo=&quot;DeepLearning_grid_1_AutoML_1_20231116_204416_model_581.zip&quot;\n\n# Load data\ndf_prever = read_csv(filepath_or_buffer = csv_file, sep=delimiter, decimal=decimal_sep, encoding=encoding)\ndf_prever = df_prever.reset_index(drop=True)\n\n#load H2O Model\nh2o.init()\n\n# Import the MOJO file\nmojo_path = model_mojo\nimported_model = h2o.import_mojo(mojo_path)\n\n# Run Model\nnew_observations = h2o.H2OFrame(df_prever)\npredictions = imported_model.predict(new_observations)\n\n# Save Results\npredictions = predictions.as_data_frame(predictions)\ndata_results = pd.concat([df_prever, predictions], axis=1)\ndata_results = data_results.rename(columns={&quot;predict&quot; : &quot;Predicted_Values&quot;}) \ndata_results = data_results.infer_objects()\ndata_results.to_csv(&quot;./Data_Results.csv&quot;, sep=delimiter, decimal=decimal_sep, index=False)\n\n# Close H2O\nh2o.cluster().shutdown()\n</code></pre>\n<p>I tried to call the model in Java (probably I did it wrong) using the h2o-genmodel.jar and the zip file, but it asks for a &quot;main&quot; file I don't have.

It does this by taking into account all the fields of the object.</p>\n<p>Your test code:</p>\n<pre><code>@Override\npublic void run(String... args) {\n    log.info(&quot;service1 hashcode &quot; + service1.hashCode());\n    service1.setAmount(100L);\n    service1.setPaymentStatus(&quot;success&quot;);\n    log.info(&quot;service2 hashcode &quot; + service2.hashCode());\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>only shows that if you change the fields of an object the hashcode for that object changes.</p>\n<p>Specifically it cannot show that the hashcode from <code>service1</code> is different from the hashcode of <code>service2</code> (hint: they are not because <strong>there is only one object</strong>) because you change that object between the two calls and that just shows that the hashcode changes if the object changes.</p>\n<p>To show that the hashcode for <code>service1</code> is different from the hashcode for <code>service2</code> <strong>you must print</strong> both hashcodes before changing the object (and you may want to print both hashcodes after changing the object):</p>\n<pre><code>@Override\npublic void run(String... args) {\n    log.info(&quot;hashcode before changing the object&quot;);\n    log.info(&quot;service1 hashcode &quot; + service1.hashCode());\n    log.info(&quot;service2 hashcode &quot; + service2.hashCode());\n    log.info(&quot;changing the object&quot;);\n    service1.setAmount(100L);\n    service1.setPaymentStatus(&quot;success&quot;);\n    log.info(&quot;hashcode after changing the object&quot;);\n    log.info(&quot;service1 hashcode &quot; + service1.hashCode());\n    log.info(&quot;service2 hashcode &quot; + service2.hashCode());\n}\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>When I use the @EqualsAndHashCode annotation top of the class, service1 and service2 hashcode values are output differently.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, with your sample code the hashcode values are output differently - because between those two output <strong>you modified the object by changing fields</strong> and changing the fields leads to a different hashcode value.</p>\n<p>But this is not because Lomboks <code>@EqualsAndHashCode</code> is broken - it is because your sample code (especially the part where you want to show that the hashcode changes) is broken.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your sample code behaves in this way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your house is painted white</li>\n<li>you take a picture of your house</li>\n<li>you paint your house green</li>\n<li>you take a picture of your house</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And then you ask someone &quot;why in the first picture is my house white when it is green in the second picture?&quot;</p>\n<p>Well it is because you painted your house green!?</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":22389872,"reputation":39,"user_id":16602133,"display_name":"expelliarmus"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1700522907,"creation_date":1700383788,"question_id":77510176,"body_markdown":"I am trying the singleton design pattern.

What database column types you should use\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYour first question was:\r\n\r\n&gt; What data types would you use in the database (assuming MySQL, possibly in a different timezone that the JVM)? Will the data types be timezone-aware?\r\n\r\nIn MySQL, the `TIMESTAMP` column type does a shifting from the JDBC driver local time zone to the database timezone, but it can only store timestamps up to `2038-01-19 03:14:07.999999`, so it&#39;s not the best choice for the future.\r\n\r\nSo, better to use `DATETIME` instead, which doesn&#39;t have this upper boundary limitation. However, `DATETIME` is not timezone aware. So, for this reason, it&#39;s best to use UTC on the database side and use the `hibernate.jdbc.time_zone` Hibernate property.\r\n\r\n2. What entity property type you should use\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYour second question was:\r\n\r\n&gt; What data types would you use in Java (Date, Calendar, long, ...)?\r\n\r\nOn the Java side, you can use the Java 8 `LocalDateTime`. You can also use the legacy `Date`, but the Java 8 Date/Time types are better since they are immutable, and don&#39;t do a timezone shifting to local timezone when logging them.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, we can also answer this question:\r\n\r\n&gt; What annotations would you use for the mapping (e.g. `@Temporal`)?\r\n\r\nIf you are using the `LocalDateTime` or `java.sql.Timestamp` to map a timestamp entity property, then you don&#39;t need to use `@Temporal` since HIbernate already knows that this property is to be saved as a JDBC Timestamp.\r\n\r\nOnly if you are using `java.util.Date`, you need to specify the `@Temporal` annotation, like this:\r\n\r\n    @Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;created_on&quot;)\r\n    private Date createdOn;\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, it&#39;s much better if you map it like this:\r\n\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;created_on&quot;)\r\n    private LocalDateTime createdOn;\r\n\r\nHow to generate the audit column values\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYour third question was:\r\n\r\n&gt; Whom would you make responsible for setting the timestamps—the database, the ORM framework (Hibernate), or the application programmer?\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; What annotations would you use for the mapping (e.g. @Temporal)?\r\n\r\nThere are many ways you can achieve this goal. You can allow the database to do that..\r\n\r\nFor the `create_on` column, you could use a `DEFAULT` DDL constraint, like :\r\n\r\n    ALTER TABLE post \r\n    ADD CONSTRAINT created_on_default \r\n    DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() FOR created_on;\r\n\r\nFor the `updated_on` column, you could use a DB trigger to set the column value with `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` every time a given row is modified.\r\n\r\nOr, use JPA or Hibernate to set those.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s assume you have the following database tables:\r\n\r\n[![Database tables with audit columns][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAnd, each table has columns like:\r\n\r\n- `created_by`\r\n- `created_on`\r\n- `updated_by`\r\n- `updated_on`\r\n\r\nUsing Hibernate `@CreationTimestamp` and `@UpdateTimestamp` annotations\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHibernate offers the `@CreationTimestamp` and `@UpdateTimestamp` annotations that can be used to map the `created_on` and `updated_on` columns.\r\n\r\nYou can use `@MappedSuperclass` to define a base class that will be extended by all entities:\r\n\r\n    @MappedSuperclass\r\n    public class BaseEntity {\r\n     \r\n        @Id\r\n        @GeneratedValue\r\n        private Long id;\r\n     \r\n    \t@Column(name = &quot;created_on&quot;)\r\n    \t@CreationTimestamp\r\n    \tprivate LocalDateTime createdOn;\r\n     \r\n    \t@Column(name = &quot;created_by&quot;)\r\n    \tprivate String createdBy;\r\n     \r\n    \t@Column(name = &quot;updated_on&quot;)\r\n    \t@UpdateTimestamp\r\n    \tprivate LocalDateTime updatedOn;\r\n     \r\n    \t@Column(name = &quot;updated_by&quot;)\r\n    \tprivate String updatedBy;\r\n     \r\n        //Getters and setters omitted for brevity\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd, all entities will extend the `BaseEntity`, like this:\r\n\r\n    @Entity(name = &quot;Post&quot;)\r\n    @Table(name = &quot;post&quot;)\r\n    public class Post extend BaseEntity {\r\n     \r\n    \tprivate String title;\r\n     \r\n    \t@OneToMany(\r\n    \t\tmappedBy = &quot;post&quot;,\r\n    \t\tcascade = CascadeType.ALL,\r\n    \t\torphanRemoval = true\r\n    \t)\r\n    \tprivate List&lt;PostComment&gt; comments = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n     \r\n    \t@OneToOne(\r\n    \t\tmappedBy = &quot;post&quot;,\r\n    \t\tcascade = CascadeType.ALL,\r\n    \t\torphanRemoval = true,\r\n    \t\tfetch = FetchType.LAZY\r\n    \t)\r\n    \tprivate PostDetails details;\r\n     \r\n    \t@ManyToMany\r\n    \t@JoinTable(\r\n    \t\tname = &quot;post_tag&quot;,\r\n    \t\tjoinColumns = @JoinColumn(\r\n    \t\t\tname = &quot;post_id&quot;\r\n    \t\t),\r\n    \t\tinverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(\r\n    \t\t\tname = &quot;tag_id&quot;\r\n    \t\t)\r\n    \t)\r\n    \tprivate List&lt;Tag&gt; tags = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n     \r\n    \t//Getters and setters omitted for brevity\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHowever, even if the `createdOn` and `updateOn` properties are set by the Hibernate-specific `@CreationTimestamp` and `@UpdateTimestamp` annotations, the `createdBy` and `updatedBy` require registering an application callback, as illustrated by the following JPA solution.\r\n\r\nUsing JPA `@EntityListeners`\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nYou can encapsulate the audit properties in an Embeddable:\r\n\r\n    @Embeddable\r\n    public class Audit {\r\n     \r\n        @Column(name = &quot;created_on&quot;)\r\n        private LocalDateTime createdOn;\r\n     \r\n        @Column(name = &quot;created_by&quot;)\r\n        private String createdBy;\r\n     \r\n        @Column(name = &quot;updated_on&quot;)\r\n        private LocalDateTime updatedOn;\r\n     \r\n        @Column(name = &quot;updated_by&quot;)\r\n        private String updatedBy;\r\n     \r\n        //Getters and setters omitted for brevity\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd, create an `AuditListener` to set the audit properties:\r\n\r\n    public class AuditListener {\r\n     \r\n        @PrePersist\r\n        public void setCreatedOn(Auditable auditable) {\r\n            Audit audit = auditable.getAudit();\r\n     \r\n            if(audit == null) {\r\n                audit = new Audit();\r\n                auditable.setAudit(audit);\r\n            }\r\n     \r\n            audit.setCreatedOn(LocalDateTime.now());\r\n            audit.setCreatedBy(LoggedUser.get());\r\n        }\r\n     \r\n        @PreUpdate\r\n        public void setUpdatedOn(Auditable auditable) {\r\n            Audit audit = auditable.getAudit();\r\n     \r\n            audit.setUpdatedOn(LocalDateTime.now());\r\n            audit.setUpdatedBy(LoggedUser.get());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nTo register the `AuditListener`, you can use the `@EntityListeners` JPA annotation:\r\n\r\n    @Entity(name = &quot;Post&quot;)\r\n    @Table(name = &quot;post&quot;)\r\n    @EntityListeners(AuditListener.class)\r\n    public class Post implements Auditable {\r\n     \r\n        @Id\r\n        private Long id;\r\n     \r\n        @Embedded\r\n        private Audit audit;\r\n     \r\n        private String title;\r\n     \r\n        @OneToMany(\r\n            mappedBy = &quot;post&quot;,\r\n            cascade = CascadeType.ALL,\r\n            orphanRemoval = true\r\n        )\r\n        private List&lt;PostComment&gt; comments = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n     \r\n        @OneToOne(\r\n            mappedBy = &quot;post&quot;,\r\n            cascade = CascadeType.ALL,\r\n            orphanRemoval = true,\r\n            fetch = FetchType.LAZY\r\n        )\r\n        private PostDetails details;\r\n     \r\n        @ManyToMany\r\n        @JoinTable(\r\n            name = &quot;post_tag&quot;,\r\n            joinColumns = @JoinColumn(\r\n                name = &quot;post_id&quot;\r\n            ),\r\n            inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(\r\n                name = &quot;tag_id&quot;\r\n            )\r\n        )\r\n        private List&lt;Tag&gt;

You can also use the legacy <code>Date</code>, but the Java 8 Date/Time types are better since they are immutable, and don't do a timezone shifting to local timezone when logging them.</p>\n<p>Now, we can also answer this question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What annotations would you use for the mapping (e.g. <code>@Temporal</code>)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you are using the <code>LocalDateTime</code> or <code>java.sql.Timestamp</code> to map a timestamp entity property, then you don't need to use <code>@Temporal</code> since HIbernate already knows that this property is to be saved as a JDBC Timestamp.</p>\n<p>Only if you are using <code>java.util.Date</code>, you need to specify the <code>@Temporal</code> annotation, like this:</p>\n<pre><code>@Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)\n@Column(name = &quot;created_on&quot;)\nprivate Date createdOn;\n</code></pre>\n<p>But, it's much better if you map it like this:</p>\n<pre><code>@Column(name = &quot;created_on&quot;)\nprivate LocalDateTime createdOn;\n</code></pre>\n<h2>How to generate the audit column values</h2>\n<p>Your third question was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whom would you make responsible for setting the timestamps—the database, the ORM framework (Hibernate), or the application programmer?</p>\n<p>What annotations would you use for the mapping (e.g. @Temporal)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are many ways you can achieve this goal. You can allow the database to do that..</p>\n<p>For the <code>create_on</code> column, you could use a <code>DEFAULT</code> DDL constraint, like :</p>\n<pre><code>ALTER TABLE post \nADD CONSTRAINT created_on_default \nDEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() FOR created_on;\n</code></pre>\n<p>For the <code>updated_on</code> column, you could use a DB trigger to set the column value with <code>CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()</code> every time a given row is modified.</p>\n<p>Or, use JPA or Hibernate to set those.</p>\n<p>Let's assume you have the following database tables:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DQ59s.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DQ59s.png\" alt=\"Database tables with audit columns\" /></a></p>\n<p>And, each table has columns like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>created_by</code></li>\n<li><code>created_on</code></li>\n<li><code>updated_by</code></li>\n<li><code>updated_on</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Using Hibernate <code>@CreationTimestamp</code> and <code>@UpdateTimestamp</code> annotations</h2>\n<p>Hibernate offers the <code>@CreationTimestamp</code> and <code>@UpdateTimestamp</code> annotations that can be used to map the <code>created_on</code> and <code>updated_on</code> columns.</p>\n<p>You can use <code>@MappedSuperclass</code> to define a base class that will be extended by all entities:</p>\n<pre><code>@MappedSuperclass\npublic class BaseEntity {\n \n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue\n    private Long id;\n \n    @Column(name = &quot;created_on&quot;)\n    @CreationTimestamp\n    private LocalDateTime createdOn;\n \n    @Column(name = &quot;created_by&quot;)\n    private String createdBy;\n \n    @Column(name = &quot;updated_on&quot;)\n    @UpdateTimestamp\n    private LocalDateTime updatedOn;\n \n    @Column(name = &quot;updated_by&quot;)\n    private String updatedBy;\n \n    //Getters and setters omitted for brevity\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And, all entities will extend the <code>BaseEntity</code>, like this:</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity(name = &quot;Post&quot;)\n@Table(name = &quot;post&quot;)\npublic class Post extend BaseEntity {\n \n    private String title;\n \n    @OneToMany(\n        mappedBy = &quot;post&quot;,\n        cascade = CascadeType.ALL,\n        orphanRemoval = true\n    )\n    private List&lt;PostComment&gt;

tags = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\n \n    //Getters and setters omitted for brevity\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, even if the <code>createdOn</code> and <code>updateOn</code> properties are set by the Hibernate-specific <code>@CreationTimestamp</code> and <code>@UpdateTimestamp</code> annotations, the <code>createdBy</code> and <code>updatedBy</code> require registering an application callback, as illustrated by the following JPA solution.</p>\n<h2>Using JPA <code>@EntityListeners</code></h2>\n<p>You can encapsulate the audit properties in an Embeddable:</p>\n<pre><code>@Embeddable\npublic class Audit {\n \n    @Column(name = &quot;created_on&quot;)\n    private LocalDateTime createdOn;\n \n    @Column(name = &quot;created_by&quot;)\n    private String createdBy;\n \n    @Column(name = &quot;updated_on&quot;)\n    private LocalDateTime updatedOn;\n \n    @Column(name = &quot;updated_by&quot;)\n    private String updatedBy;\n \n    //Getters and setters omitted for brevity\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And, create an <code>AuditListener</code> to set the audit properties:</p>\n<pre><code>public class AuditListener {\n \n    @PrePersist\n    public void setCreatedOn(Auditable auditable) {\n        Audit audit = auditable.getAudit();\n \n        if(audit == null) {\n            audit = new Audit();\n            auditable.setAudit(audit);\n        }\n \n        audit.setCreatedOn(LocalDateTime.now());\n        audit.setCreatedBy(LoggedUser.get());\n    }\n \n    @PreUpdate\n    public void setUpdatedOn(Auditable auditable) {\n        Audit audit = auditable.getAudit();\n \n        audit.setUpdatedOn(LocalDateTime.now());\n        audit.setUpdatedBy(LoggedUser.get());\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>To register the <code>AuditListener</code>, you can use the <code>@EntityListeners</code> JPA annotation:</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity(name = &quot;Post&quot;)\n@Table(name = &quot;post&quot;)\n@EntityListeners(AuditListener.class)\npublic class Post implements Auditable {\n \n    @Id\n    private Long id;\n \n    @Embedded\n    private Audit audit;\n \n    private String title;\n \n    @OneToMany(\n        mappedBy = &quot;post&quot;,\n        cascade = CascadeType.ALL,\n        orphanRemoval = true\n    )\n    private List&lt;PostComment&gt;

Inquerydsl-sql, this is done by wrapping the query in a subquery, like so: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (&amp;lt;original query&amp;gt;). Unfortunately, JPQL - the query language of JPA - does not allow queries to project from subqueries. As a result there isn&#39;t a universal way to express count queries in JPQL. Historically QueryDSL attempts at producing a modified query to compute the number of results instead. However, this approach only works for simple queries. Specifically queries with multiple group by clauses and queries with a having clause turn out to be problematic.

Inquerydsl-sql, this is done by wrapping the query in a subquery, like so: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (&lt;original query&gt;). Unfortunately, JPQL - the query language of JPA - does not allow queries to project from subqueries. As a result there isn't a universal way to express count queries in JPQL. Historically QueryDSL attempts at producing a modified query to compute the number of results instead. However, this approach only works for simple queries. Specifically queries with multiple group by clauses and queries with a having clause turn out to be problematic. This is because COUNT(DISTINCT a, b, c), while valid SQL in most dialects, is not valid JPQL. Furthermore, a having clause may refer select elements or aggregate functions and therefore cannot be emulated by moving the predicate to the where clause instead.

I want to assert input field border color change to red. Selenium is too fast and does the assert before border color changes, so test breaks with rbg color mismatch. Also, I am using Javascript Executor to click on Submit button, because there is a google ads banner that cannot be closed or minimized (shows only on Chrome).\r\n\r\n[Submit button hiden behind the ad image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/svsmC.png)\r\n\r\n1. As using Thread.sleep is not a good practice, is there any other way I can resolve the issue using wdwait?\r\n2. Also, is there another way to click the element in this case without using Javascript Executor?\r\n\r\n**My code for Problem 2:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Test\r\n    public void demoQANegativeRegistrationTest() throws InterruptedException {\r\n        driver.get(&quot;https://demoqa.com/automation-practice-form&quot;);\r\n        driver.findElement(By.id(&quot;userNumber&quot;)).sendKeys(&quot;12345&quot;);\r\n        jse.executeScript(&quot;arguments[0].click();&quot;, driver.findElement(By.id(&quot;submit&quot;)));\r\n        Thread.sleep(2000);\r\n        //wdwait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(&quot;//*[@class=\\&quot;was-validated\\&quot;]&quot;)));\r\n        WebElement icon = driver.findElement(By.id(&quot;userNumber&quot;));\r\n        String userNumberBorderColor = icon.getCssValue(&quot;border-color&quot;);\r\n        Assert.assertEquals(&quot;rgb(220, 53, 69)&quot;, userNumberBorderColor);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Problem 1:** I tried introducting several different WebDriverWaits like presenceOfElement, elementToBeClickable, refreshed, but each time the result is the same (some of them are commented in the code above). If I add Thread.sleep after jse, test runs perfectly.\r\n\r\n**Problem 2:** I identified class element with value &quot;was-validated&quot; appears after border color changes to red, so I tried waiting on that before doing the assert, but every time test gets wrong rbg color (default grey one). You can find it commented in the code.
