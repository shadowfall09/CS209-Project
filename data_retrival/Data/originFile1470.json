The instance variable s is updated by twice()'s x, which is 14.\n//ANOTHER QUESTION</p>\n<pre><code>```\n    class Two \n    {\n        byte x;\n    }\n    \n    class PassO \n    {\n        public static void main(String [] args) \n        {\n            PassO p = new PassO();\n            p.start();\n        }\n    \n        void start() \n        {\n            Two t = new Two();\n            System.out.print(t.x + &quot; &quot;);\n            Two t2 = fix(t);\n            System.out.println(t.x + &quot; &quot; + t2.x);\n        }\n    \n        Two fix(Two tt) \n        {\n            tt.x = 42;\n            return tt;\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n    ans= 0 42 42\n</code></pre>\n<p>explanation:\nIn the fix() method, the reference variable tt refers to the same object (class Two) as the t reference variable. Updating tt.x in the fix() method updates t.x (they are one in the same object). Remember also that the instance variable x in the Two class is initialized to 0.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","swing","user-interface","mouse-cursor"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4804,"reputation":268579,"user_id":7412,"accept_rate":96,"display_name":"dogbane"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1288272154,"creation_date":1288272154,"answer_id":4043317,"question_id":4042678,"body_markdown":"As this is an animated cursor, it&#39;s not trivial to display.

That java add a <code>0</code> to the end of the name?</p>\n<p>If that's the plan, how should javac deal with this:</p>\n<pre><code>Parent p = new Child();\np.foo();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Which <code>foo</code> is intended there? <code>foo()Ljava/lang/Object;</code> from Parent, or <code>foo0()L/java/Object;</code> from child?</p>\n<p>You can write a spec that gives an answer to this question (presumably, here it's obvious: Parent's foo; had you written <code>Child c = new Child(); c.foo();</code> then <code>foo0</code> was intended, but that makes the language quite complicated, and for what purpose?</p>\n<p>The java language designers did not think this is a useful exercise and therefore didn't add this complication to the language. I'm pretty sure that was clearly the right call, but your opinion may of course be different.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":22333553,"reputation":11,"user_id":16554496,"display_name":"user16554496"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":486,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1627640674,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1648742672,"creation_date":1627567922,"question_id":68577538,"body_markdown":"In Java, what is the actual reason behind the inability to write a method in a sub class which has the same name as a `final` method in the super class?

Then `(input = input.replaceAll(...)).length()` is evaluated, which does two things: it assigns the next string to `input`, and it returns the length of that next string.\r\n\r\nFinally, the two lengths are compared. If equal, the loop terminates because nothing more can be replaced. If not equal, it means that some matching pair has been removed, and we will do another iteration, now with the new value of `input`.\r\n\r\nFinally, we just check whether the resulting string is empty:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.out.println(input.isEmpty());\r\n```","title":"Facing problems understanding the following algorithm solution","body":"<p>The string <code>&quot;\\\\(\\\\)|\\\\[\\\\]|\\\\{\\\\}&quot;</code> given to <code>replaceAll</code> is a regular expression.

And you need to know that Java <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6800590/what-are-the-rules-for-evaluation-order-in-java\">always evaluates subexpressions from left to right</a>.</p>\n<p>So first, <code>input.length()</code> is evaluated, producing the length of the original string. Then <code>(input = input.replaceAll(...)).length()</code> is evaluated, which does two things: it assigns the next string to <code>input</code>, and it returns the length of that next string.</p>\n<p>Finally, the two lengths are compared. If equal, the loop terminates because nothing more can be replaced. If not equal, it means that some matching pair has been removed, and we will do another iteration, now with the new value of <code>input</code>.</p>\n<p>Finally, we just check whether the resulting string is empty:</p>\n<pre><code>System.out.println(input.isEmpty());\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":19122572,"reputation":69,"user_id":18235424,"display_name":"Shtaiwee"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":346,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":71693068,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1648735357,"creation_date":1648724226,"question_id":71691301,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m new to Hacker Rank and I&#39;m currently solving problems in the java stack, I tried to solve this algorithm:\r\n\r\nA string containing only parentheses is balanced if the following is true: 1. if it is an empty string 2. if A and B are correct, AB is correct, 3. if A is correct, (A) and {A} and [A] are also correct.\r\n\r\nExamples of some correctly balanced strings are: &quot;{}()&quot;, &quot;[{()}]&quot;, &quot;({()})&quot;\r\n\r\nExamples of some unbalanced strings are: &quot;{}(&quot;, &quot;({)}&quot;, &quot;[[&quot;, &quot;}{&quot; etc.\r\n\r\nGiven a string, determine if it is balanced or not.\r\n\r\n*********************************************\r\nAnd I found the following one liner solution which I couldn&#39;t understand can someone explain it please?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    class Solution{\r\n    \t public static void main(String []argh)\r\n    \t {\r\n    \t\tScanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\twhile (sc.hasNext()) {\r\n    \t\t\tString input=sc.next();\r\n                while(input.length() != (input = input.replaceAll(&quot;\\\\(\\\\)|\\\\[\\\\]|\\\\{\\\\}&quot;, &quot;&quot;)).length());\r\n                System.out.println(input.isEmpty());\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t}\r\n    }","title":"Facing problems understanding the following algorithm solution","body":"<p>I'm new to Hacker Rank and I'm currently solving problems in the java stack, I tried to solve this algorithm:</p>\n<p>A string containing only parentheses is balanced if the following is true: 1. if it is an empty string 2. if A and B are correct, AB is correct, 3. if A is correct, (A) and {A} and [A] are also correct.</p>\n<p>Examples of some correctly balanced strings are: &quot;{}()&quot;, &quot;[{()}]&quot;, &quot;({()})&quot;</p>\n<p>Examples of some unbalanced strings are: &quot;{}(&quot;, &quot;({)}&quot;, &quot;[[&quot;, &quot;}{&quot; etc.</p>\n<p>Given a string, determine if it is balanced or not.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>And I found the following one liner solution which I couldn't understand can someone explain it please?</p>\n<pre><code>class Solution{\n     public static void main(String []argh)\n     {\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\n        \n        while (sc.hasNext()) {\n            String input=sc.next();\n            while(input.length() != (input = input.replaceAll(&quot;\\\\(\\\\)|\\\\[\\\\]|\\\\{\\\\}&quot;, &quot;&quot;)).length());\n            System.out.println(input.isEmpty());\n        }\n        \n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","multithreading","spring-batch"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":6482932,"reputation":29552,"user_id":5019386,"display_name":"Mahmoud Ben Hassine"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1648735159,"creation_date":1648735159,"answer_id":71693866,"question_id":71672715,"body_markdown":"The `MultiResourceItemReader` reads files in sequence.

This is a useful and effective technique for mutating existing collections. My answer addresses why you shouldn&#39;t use a `Collector` to mutate an existing collection.*\r\n\r\nThe short answer is **no**, at least, not in general, you shouldn&#39;t use a `Collector` to modify an existing collection.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that collectors are designed to support parallelism, even over collections that aren&#39;t thread-safe. The way they do this is to have each thread operate independently on its own collection of intermediate results. The way each thread gets its own collection is to call the `Collector.supplier()` which is required to return a **new** collection each time.\r\n\r\nThese collections of intermediate results are then merged, again in a thread-confined fashion, until there is a single result collection. This is the final result of the `collect()` operation.\r\n\r\nA couple answers from [Balder][2] and [assylias][3] have suggested using `Collectors.toCollection()` and then passing a supplier that returns an existing list instead of a new list. This violates the requirement on the supplier, which is that it return a new, empty collection each time.\r\n\r\nThis will work for simple cases, as the examples in their answers demonstrate. However, it will fail, particularly if the stream is run in parallel. (A future version of the library might change in some unforeseen way that will cause it to fail, even in the sequential case.)\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s take a simple example:\r\n\r\n    List&lt;String&gt; destList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(&quot;foo&quot;));\r\n    List&lt;String&gt; newList = Arrays.asList(&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;);\r\n    newList.parallelStream()\r\n           .collect(Collectors.toCollection(() -&gt; destList));\r\n    System.out.println(destList);\r\n\r\nWhen I run this program, I often get an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. This is because multiple threads are operating on `ArrayList`, a thread-unsafe data structure. OK, let&#39;s make it synchronized:\r\n\r\n    List&lt;String&gt; destList =\r\n        Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(&quot;foo&quot;)));\r\n\r\nThis will no longer fail with an exception. But instead of the expected result:\r\n\r\n    [foo, 0, 1, 2, 3]\r\n\r\nit gives weird results like this:\r\n\r\n    [foo, 2, 3, foo, 2, 3, 1, 0, foo, 2, 3, foo, 2, 3, 1, 0, foo, 2, 3, foo, 2, 3, 1, 0, foo, 2, 3, foo, 2, 3, 1, 0]\r\n\r\nThis is the result of the thread-confined accumulation/merging operations I described above. With a parallel stream, each thread calls the supplier to get its own collection for intermediate accumulation. If you pass a supplier that returns the **same** collection, each thread appends its results to that collection. Since there is no ordering among the threads, results will be appended in some arbitrary order.\r\n\r\nThen, when these intermediate collections are merged, this basically merges the list with itself. Lists are merged using `List.addAll()`, which says that the results are undefined if the source collection is modified during the operation. In this case, `ArrayList.addAll()` does an array-copy operation, so it ends up duplicating itself, which is sort-of what one would expect, I guess. (Note that other List implementations might have completely different behavior.) Anyway, this explains the weird results and duplicated elements in the destination.\r\n\r\nYou might say, &quot;I&#39;ll just make sure to run my stream sequentially&quot; and go ahead and write code like this\r\n\r\n    stream.collect(Collectors.toCollection(() -&gt; existingList))\r\n\r\nanyway. I&#39;d recommend against doing this. If you control the stream, sure, you can guarantee that it won&#39;t run in parallel. I expect that a style of programming will emerge where streams get handed around instead of collections. If somebody hands you a stream and you use this code, it&#39;ll fail if the stream happens to be parallel. Worse, somebody might hand you a sequential stream and this code will work fine for a while, pass all tests, etc. Then, some arbitrary amount of time later, code elsewhere in the system might change to use parallel streams which will cause **your** code to break.\r\n\r\nOK, then just make sure to remember to call `sequential()` on any stream before you use this code:\r\n\r\n    stream.sequential().collect(Collectors.toCollection(() -&gt; existingList))\r\n\r\nOf course, you&#39;ll remember to do this every time, right? :-) Let&#39;s say you do.

I cleaned things up a bit, but the code does not differ much.  Main thing though is I checked whether the ```device != None``` and ```if rfsocket.connected:``` before creating getInputStream within my eventloop, so as not to re-create the socket object.  Have to test more to see where was the main problem.  Still do not no what the arguments are of the ```read``` and ```write``` method.  The ```readLine()``` method returns the string intermitantly or not at all and my eventloop seems to not work with the ```readLine()``` method.   \r\n&lt;h3&gt;Update on update:&lt;/h3&gt;\r\nThe event loop works again.  My bad, I did not call the trigger object correctly.  The ```readLine()``` method has a strange pattern in that on the first read it gives me ```JavaException:  JVM exception occurred: Attempt to invoke virtual method &#39;int java.io.InputStream.available()&#39; on a null object reference```, subsequent reads gives me pieces of the expected string or an empty string.  I had similar string bits and pieces returned when I received the data via a hardline using PySerial.  The solution was resetting the input buffer.  Is there something similar in the above java libraries?\r\n&lt;h1&gt;Finally cracked the exceptions:&lt;/h1&gt;\r\nYes, this is exciting!  After many hours I had noticed that I could not get the Input anymore only exceptions.  I tried the ```BufferedInputStream``` library and got the same result, there was no more intermittant read.  Why?  So I re-Apk&#39;d the ```main``` file of last night and boom intermittant Input read once again. &lt;br&gt; \r\nThe reason was if I create the java objects when the ```rfsocket``` Bluetooth object is not connected to the specified port, ```Null``` objects was initialised on a different port which for some reason was not seen by the ```if``` blocks ```self.recv_stream is not None``` and ```self.recv_stream != None```.  Probably because they are not ```Null``` objects but ```Null``` for the subsequent port 1 socket connection I specified.&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe ```readline()``` work as is in my example, the ```read()``` takes three arguments ```bytes(), int offset, int len(bytes()``` which is not clear from the ```jnius.jnius.exception``` hieroglyphics&#39; message.  Still figuring out the ```write``` method.  One thing that you can specify in the ```BufferedReader``` method is a 2nd argument for the chunk size you want to read or in java speak ```defaultCharBufferSize```.\r\n[1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29719898/how-to-convert-android-bluetooth-socket-inputstream-to-python-string-in-kivy","title":"How to use the pyjnius read and write arguments for Bluetooth getInputStream and getOutputStream?","body":"<p>I have been fumbling with getting data from a bluetooth RS232 converter using the python for android jnius library.

I tried finding this in the developer android docs as well as DuckDuckGoing it but with no clarity. <br> I also tried the <code>BufferedReader</code> example (<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29719898/how-to-convert-android-bluetooth-socket-inputstream-to-python-string-in-kivy\">Here</a>) using the <code>readLine()</code> method, but I am constantly getting an error:  <code>JavaException:  JVM exception occurred: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'int java.io.InputStream.read(byte[], int, int)' on a null object reference</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Can someone please point me to the documentation to understand the above read and write arguments? <br>\nAlso, please help me to understand why the <code>read, readLine() and write</code> objects does not return any data?</p>\n\n<p>Java libraries I call:</p>\n\n<pre><code>BluetoothAdapter = autoclass('android.bluetooth.BluetoothAdapter')\nBluetoothDevice = autoclass('android.bluetooth.BluetoothDevice')\nBluetoothSocket = autoclass('android.bluetooth.BluetoothSocket')\nInputStreamReader = autoclass('java.io.InputStreamReader')\nBufferedReader = autoclass('java.io.BufferedReader')\nUUID = autoclass('java.util.UUID')\nSystem = autoclass('java.lang.System')\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Connecting code (got this from Github and above link):</p>\n\n<pre><code>    def get_socket_stream(self, name):\n        paired_devices = BluetoothAdapter.getDefaultAdapter().getBondedDevices().toArray()\n        self.rfsocket == None\n        for device in paired_devices:\n            if device.getName() == name:\n                if device.bluetoothEnabled:\n                    if not device.connected:\n                        self.rfsocket = device.createInsecureRfcommSocketToServiceRecord(\n                            UUID.fromString(\"00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb\"))\n                        self.reader = InputStreamReader(self.rfsocket.getInputStream(), 'LATIN-1')\n                        recv_stream = BufferedReader(self.reader)\n                        send_stream = self.rfsocket.getOutputStream()\n                        break\n        print(self.rfsocket.getRemoteDevice().getName())\n        if self.rfsocket.port &lt;= 0:\n            self.rfsocket = device.createRfcommSocket(1)\n            if not self.rfsocket.connected:\n                print('port two: ',self.rfsocket.port)\n                self.rfsocket.connect()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Read and write code (source: same as above link):</p>\n\n<pre><code>    def GetBSerial(self):\n        self.messager('Trying Serial')\n        self.recv_stream, self.send_stream = self.get_socket_stream(devicename)\n        if  not self.rfsocket.connected and self.recv_stream == None:\n            print(\"Get paired device failed\")\n        else:\n            print('Initiating trigger')\n            self.weight_ticker()\n    def GetInput(self):\n        self.send_stream.write(\"Hallo\\r\\n\")\n        self.send_stream.flush\n        if self.rfsocket.connected and self.recv_stream != None:\n            if self.weigh_tme &gt; 0:\n                while self.recv_stream.ready != None:\n                    try:\n                        self.scale_output = self.recv_stream.readLine()\n                    except jnius.jnius.JavaException as e:\n                        print(\"JavaException: \", e, self.rfsocket.connected)\n                    except ValueError as e:\n                        print(\"Misc error: \", e)\n\n                    try:\n                        self.show_input(self.scale_output)\n                    except ValueError:\n                        pass\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Update:</h3>\n\n<p>So I finally got the Input using the <code>readLine()</code> method to not return an error and also return the string.  I cleaned things up a bit, but the code does not differ much.  Main thing though is I checked whether the <code>device != None</code> and <code>if rfsocket.connected:</code> before creating getInputStream within my eventloop, so as not to re-create the socket object.  Have to test more to see where was the main problem.  Still do not no what the arguments are of the <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> method.  The <code>readLine()</code> method returns the string intermitantly or not at all and my eventloop seems to not work with the <code>readLine()</code> method.   </p>\n\n<h3>Update on update:</h3>\n\n<p>The event loop works again.  My bad, I did not call the trigger object correctly.  The <code>readLine()</code> method has a strange pattern in that on the first read it gives me <code>JavaException:  JVM exception occurred: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'int java.io.InputStream.available()' on a null object reference</code>, subsequent reads gives me pieces of the expected string or an empty string.  I had similar string bits and pieces returned when I received the data via a hardline using PySerial.  The solution was resetting the input buffer.  Is there something similar in the above java libraries?</p>\n\n<h1>Finally cracked the exceptions:</h1>\n\n<p>Yes, this is exciting!  After many hours I had noticed that I could not get the Input anymore only exceptions.  I tried the <code>BufferedInputStream</code> library and got the same result, there was no more intermittant read.  Why?  So I re-Apk'd the <code>main</code> file of last night and boom intermittant Input read once again. <br> \nThe reason was if I create the java objects when the <code>rfsocket</code> Bluetooth object is not connected to the specified port, <code>Null</code> objects was initialised on a different port which for some reason was not seen by the <code>if</code> blocks <code>self.recv_stream is not None</code> and <code>self.recv_stream != None</code>.  Probably because they are not <code>Null</code> objects but <code>Null</code> for the subsequent port 1 socket connection I specified.<br>\nThe <code>readline()</code> work as is in my example, the <code>read()</code> takes three arguments <code>bytes(), int offset, int len(bytes()</code> which is not clear from the <code>jnius.jnius.exception</code> hieroglyphics' message.  Still figuring out the <code>write</code> method.  One thing that you can specify in the <code>BufferedReader</code> method is a 2nd argument for the chunk size you want to read or in java speak <code>defaultCharBufferSize</code>.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","compiler-errors"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":-1,"reputation":1,"user_id":-1,"display_name":"Community"},"score":0,"creation_date":1648734565,"post_id":71692709,"comment_id":126704048,"body_markdown":"Please clarify your specific problem or provide additional details to highlight exactly what you need.
