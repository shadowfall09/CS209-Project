I found a way to restrict the BG color of a label to 'inside the border' by setting a <code>Clip</code> (representing the area outside the rounded corners) on the <code>Graphics2D</code> instance and calling <code>clearRect()</code>.  That can be seen in <code>Label 1</code>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uAYxi.png\" alt=\"Border Test\"></p>\n\n<p>However you can see the downside of this approach when there is a red BG (or any non-standard color) on the parent panel.  The corners default to the default panel color (easiest to see in <code>Panel 2</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately I would like this to work for a non-standard color in the parent container, but it was partly inspired by <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/14898497/418556\">What do I need to do to replicate this component with gradient paint?</a></p>\n\n<p>Does anybody know a way to get those corners transparent?</p>\n\n<pre><code>import java.awt.*;\nimport java.awt.geom.*;\nimport javax.swing.*;\nimport javax.swing.border.*;\n\npublic class BorderTest {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Runnable r = new Runnable() {\n\n            @Override\n            public void run() {\n                JPanel gui = new JPanel(new GridLayout(1,0,5,5));\n                gui.setBorder(new EmptyBorder(10,10,10,10));\n                gui.setBackground(Color.RED);\n\n                AbstractBorder brdr = new TextBubbleBorder(Color.BLACK,2,16,0);\n\n                JLabel l1 = new JLabel(\"Label 1\");\n                l1.setBorder(brdr);\n                gui.add(l1);\n\n                JLabel l2 = new JLabel(\"Label 2\");\n                l2.setBorder(brdr);\n                l2.setBackground(Color.YELLOW);\n                l2.setOpaque(true);\n                gui.add(l2);\n\n                JPanel p1 = new JPanel();\n                p1.add(new JLabel(\"Panel 1\"));\n                p1.setBorder(brdr);\n                p1.setOpaque(false);\n                gui.add(p1);\n\n                JPanel p2 = new JPanel();\n                p2.add(new JLabel(\"Panel 2\"));\n                p2.setBorder(brdr);\n                gui.add(p2);\n\n                JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, gui);\n            }\n        };\n        // Swing GUIs should be created and updated on the EDT\n        // http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/initial.html\n        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(r);\n    }\n\n}\n\nclass TextBubbleBorder extends AbstractBorder {\n\n    private Color color;\n    private int thickness = 4;\n    private int radii = 8;\n    private int pointerSize = 7;\n    private Insets insets = null;\n    private BasicStroke stroke = null;\n    private int strokePad;\n    private int pointerPad = 4;\n    RenderingHints hints;\n\n    TextBubbleBorder(\n            Color color) {\n        new TextBubbleBorder(color, 4, 8, 7);\n    }\n\n    TextBubbleBorder(\n            Color color, int thickness, int radii, int pointerSize) {\n        this.thickness = thickness;\n        this.radii = radii;\n        this.pointerSize = pointerSize;\n        this.color = color;\n\n        stroke = new BasicStroke(thickness);\n        strokePad = thickness / 2;\n\n        hints = new RenderingHints(\n                RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING,\n                RenderingHints.VALUE_ANTIALIAS_ON);\n\n        int pad = radii + strokePad;\n        int bottomPad = pad + pointerSize + strokePad;\n        insets = new Insets(pad, pad, bottomPad, pad);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Insets getBorderInsets(Component c) {\n        return insets;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Insets getBorderInsets(Component c, Insets insets) {\n        return getBorderInsets(c);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void paintBorder(\n            Component c,\n            Graphics g,\n            int x, int y,\n            int width, int height) {\n\n        Graphics2D g2 = (Graphics2D) g;\n\n        int bottomLineY = height - thickness - pointerSize;\n\n        RoundRectangle2D.Double bubble = new RoundRectangle2D.Double(\n                0 + strokePad,\n                0 + strokePad,\n                width - thickness,\n                bottomLineY,\n                radii,\n                radii);\n\n        Polygon pointer = new Polygon();\n\n        // left point\n        pointer.addPoint(\n                strokePad + radii + pointerPad,\n                bottomLineY);\n        // right point\n        pointer.addPoint(\n                strokePad + radii + pointerPad + pointerSize,\n                bottomLineY);\n        // bottom point\n        pointer.addPoint(\n                strokePad + radii + pointerPad + (pointerSize / 2),\n                height - strokePad);\n\n        Area area = new Area(bubble);\n        area.add(new Area(pointer));\n\n        g2.setRenderingHints(hints);\n\n        Area spareSpace = new Area(new Rectangle(0, 0, width, height));\n        spareSpace.subtract(area);\n        g2.setClip(spareSpace);\n        g2.clearRect(0, 0, width, height);\n        g2.setClip(null);\n\n        g2.setColor(color);\n        g2.setStroke(stroke);\n        g2.draw(area);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<ol>\n<li>While the <code>TextBubbleBorder</code> was devised for <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/8462414/418556\">Internal padding for JTextArea with background Image</a> (&amp;

Get your GeoJSON sample and escaped it via FreeFormatter\r\n2. Read the raw JSON into a JSONObject\r\n3. Get a JSONArray for all `features` in the GeoJSON\r\n4. Process `features` and extract an ArrayList of all coordinates for each `Polygon` present in `features`. \r\n5. Set up Postgis template for Geometry TEXT datatype `POLYGON(lng1 lat1,lng2 lat2,...)` \r\n6. Concatinate extracted coordinates of each Polygon in to Postgis template.\r\n7. Add all results (`POLYGON(lng1 lat1,lng2 lat2,...)`) generated to an ArrayList.  \r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage com.example;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\n\r\nimport
