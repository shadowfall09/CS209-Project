I've already written it for the web, but I want a desktop version, and I though java might be the way to go.</p>\n\n<p>Streams look like this (mostly MP3s):\n<a href=\"http://lyd.nrk.no/nrk_radio_mp3_mp3_h\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://lyd.nrk.no/nrk_radio_mp3_mp3_h</a> (example from NRK MP3 - a radio channel in Norway).</p>\n\n<p>So where should I go from here? I've tried both JMF, FMJ and a lot of other stuff. I just want to stream audio.. \nI appreciate all answers, please help me out! </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","jpa","jsf"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":12743722,"reputation":19956,"user_id":12567365,"display_name":"andrewJames"},"score":0,"creation_date":1656786861,"post_id":72841491,"comment_id":128658659,"body_markdown":"Sanity check: Is your persistence file really named `.persistence.xml`?

In fact, this is what the IDE also generates out of the APK file, so I&#39;ve reported this [**here**][1].\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the XML-attribute would use a namespace that isn&#39;t defined \r\n\r\nI want to be able to parse such APK, assuming that there is a default namespace (of `xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;` ) and there should be a default usage of it, too as the prefix of each attribute (meaning `android:`).\r\n\r\nSo, for the above example, it would be as if it&#39;s as such:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;manifest xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;\r\n    android:versionCode=&quot;495157437&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;uses-sdk\r\n        android:minSdkVersion=&quot;29&quot;/&gt;\r\n    \r\n&lt;/manifest&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn some other weird cases, I saw something like this for an XML attribue:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;manifest http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android:versionCode=&quot;495157437&quot; &gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;ve tried\r\n--\r\nOriginally I tried to generate the namespaces on my own so that the input of the parsing would be correct from the beginning, but this became quite complex, so I&#39;m hoping to find a solution that is flexible with the input, so that I would tell it which is the default namespace to use, and it will be as such for all attributes that don&#39;t use a namespace.\r\n\r\nThe code I use to parse the XML from a given string is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfun getXmlFromString(input: String): XmlTag? {\r\n    val factory = XmlPullParserFactory.newInstance()\r\n    factory.isNamespaceAware = true\r\n    val xpp = factory.newPullParser()\r\n    xpp.setInput(StringReader(input))\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSadly, sooner or later, the XmlPullParser would have an exception about such weird cases.\r\n\r\nI still wish to know about other weird issues if they exist, so I let `isNamespaceAware` to stay true.\r\n\r\nThe questions\r\n--\r\n1. Is such a thing possible for XmlPullParser ? I want to capture all these cases, and then treat them using a default namespace in case no valid namespace is found.\r\n\r\n2. Alternatively, or even better: Is there some way to fix the XML before parsing it, so that I will tell it what to do with invalid/missing namespaces declaration/usages ? \r\n\r\nNote that while this is related to Android, this question could benefit all that use Java/Kotlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/237785585","title":"How to parse XML and avoid parsing errors of namespace by setting a default one?","body":"<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>I'm trying to parse some manifest XML files of Android APK files</p>\n<h2>The problem</h2>\n<p>I've noticed that in some cases, the XML files aren't valid, meaning that many times there is no namespace being defined, or that for some XML attributes, the namespace isn't used at all.</p>\n<p>For example, this is a tiny part of Chrome APK manifest file (it's much longer):</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;manifest\n    versionCode=&quot;495157437&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;uses-sdk\n        minSdkVersion=&quot;29&quot;/&gt;\n    \n&lt;/manifest&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see that there is no namespace being defined here, and the attributes don't use one either.

(Go buy a copy for your bookshelf, or borrow a copy from your co-workers!) \r\n\r\nThe problem illustrated by the example code is that the constructor allows the reference to the object being constructed to &quot;escape&quot; before the constructor finishes creating the object.  This is a problem for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1.  If the reference escapes, something can use the object before its constructor has completed the initialization and see it in an inconsistent (partly initialized) state.  Even if the object escapes after initialization has completed, declaring a subclass can cause this to be violated. \r\n\r\n2.  According to [JLS 17.5][2], final attributes of an object can be used safely without synchronization.  However, this is only true if the object reference is not published (does not escape) before its constructor finished.  If you break this rule, the result is an insidious concurrency bug that *might* bite you when the code is executed on a multi-core / multi-processor machines.\r\n\r\nThe `ThisEscape` example is sneaky because the reference is escaping via the `this` reference passed implicitly to the anonymous `EventListener` class constructor.

You can confine construction to one line in the static factory method, ensuring its completion before passing it to <code>source</code>.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":33601,"reputation":28353,"user_id":94169,"accept_rate":77,"display_name":"softwarematter"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":9043,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":39,"accepted_answer_id":3705628,"answer_count":5,"score":39,"last_activity_date":1656794684,"creation_date":1284425397,"question_id":3705425,"body_markdown":"Read that the following code is an example of &quot;unsafe construction&quot; as it allows this reference to escape.

(SellPlan is a child class of ItemPlan, where SellPlan has its own implementation of the function executionPlan()). \r\n\r\nHow can I map my example json string to the following Java classes?\r\n\r\nI have tried the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRuntimeTypeAdapterFactory&lt;ItemPlan&gt; itemPlanRuntimeTypeAdapterFactory =\r\n                RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory\r\n                .of(ItemPlan.class, &quot;action&quot;)\r\n                .registerSubtype(SellPlan.class, &quot;Sell&quot;)\r\n                .registerSubtype(RemovePlan.class, &quot;Remove&quot;);\r\n\r\nGson gson = new \r\nGsonBuilder().registerTypeAdapterFactory(itemPlanRuntimeTypeAdapterFactory).create();\r\n        \r\nRequestObject request = gson.fromJson(jsonString, RequestObject.class);\r\n```\r\nThis, however, does not work. It is able to map everything I need but it fails to create the correctly create the abstracted class objects ie. while it will create the corresponding child objects (SellPlan for Sell and RemovePlan for Remove), it will make the action string of those classes null. There is a workaround where I can simply set the action string manually in the constructor of these classes but I would rather not. Is there a way to fix this?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"Mapping part of a JSON string to an abstract class using GSON","body":"<p>I have a json string that I would like to map to my java object.

Normally, if you have a java gradle project, that is trivial because the standard output of a java gradle project is a `jar` (or some classes). However, the output of an android project is an `apk` which doesn&#39;t contain your classes, it contains `.dex` files.\r\n\r\n[I wasn&#39;t able to figure out a way to build the android project and skip the dexing step][1] (i.e. build all of the classes needed without smashing them down into `.dex` files.\r\n\r\nBut I did find a way to **un-dex** the dex files: [https://github.com/pxb1988/dex2jar][2]\r\n\r\nI downloaded the dex2jar code and followed the installation instructions to build all of the various code and scripts for the dex2jar tools. I loved the generated `dex-tools` directory to my user home directory so that I could have it available in a central place. That gave me a script called `d2j-dex2jar.sh` that would convert a `.dex` file back into a `.jar` file filled with `.class` files, which was exactly what I needed. \r\n\r\nThen I added the following to my `app/build.gradle` file:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef userhome = System.properties[&#39;user.home&#39;]\r\ndef dex2jaroutputdir = &quot;$buildDir/intermediates/fulljar&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\ntask convertdextojars {\r\n    dependsOn(&#39;bundleDebug&#39;)\r\n\r\n    doLast {\r\n\r\n        def dexdir = &quot;$buildDir/intermediates/dex/debug/mergeDexDebug&quot;\r\n        def dex2jar = &quot;$userhome/dex-tools/d2j-dex2jar.sh&quot;\r\n\r\n        mkdir(dex2jaroutputdir)\r\n\r\n        fileTree(include: [&#39;*.dex&#39;], dir: dexdir).each {\r\n            def filename = it\r\n\r\n            exec {\r\n                workingDir dex2jaroutputdir\r\n                commandLine dex2jar, &#39;--force&#39;, &quot;$filename&quot;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis task depends on the android task `bundleDebug` which would build the `app-debug.apk` *but* I didn&#39;t really need to use the `apk` itself, because the intermediate files used to build the apk were available, so I could just use those. The `.dex` files that would get added to the apk are stored in `$buildDir/intermediates/dex/debug/mergeDexDebug`. I had `classes.dex`, `classes2.dex`, and `classes3.dex`, but your mileage may vary. \r\n\r\nThe `convertdextojars` task above, would create an output directory to hold my jars, then use `fileTree()` to get a collection of all of the filenames matching `*.dex` in the `dexdir`. Then for each of those files, it would execute a shell command to de-dex the file. I set the exec working directory to my `dex2jaroutputdir` because the `d2j-dex2jar.sh` script will produce the output jar to the current working directory. I add the `--force` flag to the command line so that it will overwrite the jars if they already exist. \r\n\r\nThis would get me a set of jars that had *almost* all the code I needed. It would include all of my android code, all of the code for my dependencies, but it wouldn&#39;t include the android.os.* runtime classes. \r\n\r\nNext, I added this code to my `app/build.gradle` file:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntask gendbconfig(type: JavaExec) {\r\n    dependsOn(&#39;convertdextojars&#39;)\r\n\r\n    doFirst {\r\n        println &quot;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&quot;\r\n        fileTree(include: [&#39;*.jar&#39;], dir: dex2jaroutputdir).each {\r\n            println &quot;jar: $it&quot;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    mainClass = &#39;com.kenny.stuff.DatabaseConfigUtil&#39;\r\n    classpath = fileTree(include: [&#39;*.jar&#39;], dir: dex2jaroutputdir)\r\n    classpath = classpath.plus(files(android.getBootClasspath()[0]))\r\n    workingDir = &quot;$projectDir/src/main&quot;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `doFirst()` closure isn&#39;t necessary but it was helpful to ensure that my incoming jar files were what I expected. \r\n\r\n`mainClass` is the class containing my `main()` method. \r\n\r\nThe first `classpath` line, builds the collection of those jars that we just generated, which got me *almost* to what I needed, but it was missing the android runtime classes themselves. And that&#39;s what the second `classpath` line does. `android.getBootClasspath()[0]` resolves to `/Users/kenny/Library/Android/sdk/platforms/android-31/android.jar` on my system. \r\n\r\nAs a side note, I tried using the notation `classpath +=` instead of `classpath = classpath.plus()` but the gradle build failed because of some object type issues. \r\n\r\nI set the `workingDir` to `$projectDir/src/main` (which means `app/src/main`, because the ormlite code that generates the config file will try to automatically write the config file to your `res/raw/` directory if it can find as a subdirectory of the working directory. \r\n\r\nFinally, I opened the Terminal window in Android Studio which automatically put me into the top project folder (one folder higher than the `app` module/project.

I wrote for the <code>AstroCoordinates</code> in a similar manner a coordinate class called <code>HorizontalCoordinates</code> with the appropriate tests. The tests have still errors when running, but, coming to my problem, when I try to debug them, the test stops after opening the <code>Class.class</code> file.</p>\n<p>I searched the Internet, but couldn't find an explanation for this – to me – strange behaviour.

(If it's requested I will send this code)</p>\n<p>However for the P2D and P3D renderers this code doesn't work. I found the following reason for that:</p>\n<p>P2D and P3D use JOGL (Java OpenGL) and it defines it's window type from scratch making java.awt.Window.getWindows() not detect this window. If I were able to find that window I would already have a plan on finding the PApplet.</p>\n<p>How can I find all active JOGL windows in a similar manner to java.awt.Window.getWindows()?</p>\n<p>Edit: The link to the entry in the Processing Forum: <a href=\"https://discourse.processing.org/t/get-the-current-instance-of-papplet-from-a-library/36925\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://discourse.processing.org/t/get-the-current-instance-of-papplet-from-a-library/36925</a></p>\n<p>The code that only works with the JAVA2D renderer:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import processing.awt.*;\nimport processing.core.*;\n\nimport javax.swing.*;\nimport java.awt.*;\nimport java.lang.reflect.*;\n/**This class finds the active PApplet (Processing program)*/\npublic class PAppletFinder{\n/**This class takes the contents of the window and pieces together the PApplet\n * @return PApplet of the current sketch.\n * @param c contents of the Processing window (must be a SmoothCanvas)*/\npublic static PApplet get(Component c) {\n  PSurfaceAWT.SmoothCanvas sc=(PSurfaceAWT.SmoothCanvas) c;\n  try {\n    PSurfaceAWT psa=(PSurfaceAWT) get(sc,&quot;this$0&quot;,sc.getClass());\n    PApplet prg=(PApplet) get((PSurfaceNone)psa,&quot;sketch&quot;,PSurfaceNone.class);\n    return prg;\n  }\n  catch(Exception e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n  }\n  return null;\n}\n\npublic static PApplet foundPapplet=null;\n/**The main method to be used when using the PAppletFinder*/\npublic static PApplet find() {\n    if(foundPapplet==null) foundPapplet=findFromWindow();\n    return foundPapplet;\n}\n\n/**This looks out for windows and gives the contents of the right one to the get method\n * @return PApplet of the current sketch.*/\npublic static PApplet findFromWindow() {\n  JFrame mainWindow=null;\n  java.awt.Window win[]=java.awt.Window.getWindows();\n  for (int i=0; i&lt;win.length&amp;&amp;mainWindow==null; i++) if (win[i] instanceof JFrame) mainWindow=(JFrame) win[i];\n\n  Component c=mainWindow.getContentPane().getComponents()[0];\n  return get(c);\n}\n/**This is used to get the this$0 field of the SmoothCanvas\n * Directly searching for the field didn't work.
