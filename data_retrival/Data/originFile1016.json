This Object2 is a POJO and having different fields so in other flows I'll be getting relevant information which I'll be setting to it's fields. And finally I'll be getting an object which then I'll be using in someFlow(). So I want object to be passed and enhancing that object in different flows that I have.</p>\n<p>Or let's suppose after validateRequest I want to create an object and want to pass that to the parallel flows/someFlow somehow but I don't want to hamper the payload that will be coming to the flows. By using header it's achievable but is there a different way to achieve this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","algorithm"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":401843,"reputation":89788,"user_id":768644,"display_name":"rzwitserloot"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1663777688,"creation_date":1663777688,"answer_id":73804142,"question_id":73804008,"body_markdown":"Your code checks two things:\r\n\r\n* That `str1` and `str2` have the same length.\r\n* For each character in `str1`, that this character exists in `str2`.\r\n\r\nThis does not work, as you found out.\r\n\r\nA trivial example is:\r\n\r\n* `str1` = `&quot;hello&quot;`\r\n* `str2` = `&quot;ehhlo&quot;`\r\n\r\nNote how these are _not_ permutations: `str2` has 2 `h` characters and only one `l`.

A real guns and grandmas situation. Just like `+` in java means 2 _entirely unrelated_ things: Either numeric addition, or string concatenation.\r\n\r\nHence, you shouldn&#39;t ever call it &#39;casting&#39; unless you mean specifically writing &#39;parens, type, close parens, expression&#39; which should rarely come up in normal conversation. Instead, call it what the effect of the cast operator actually is, which depends entirely on what you&#39;re writing.\r\n\r\nThe 5 things are:\r\n\r\n* Primitive conversion. Requires `Type` to be primitive and `expression` to also be primitive.\r\n* Type coercion. Requires `Type` to be non-primitive and `expression` to be non-primitive, and is only about the part that is _not_ in `&lt;&gt;` (so not the generics part).\r\n* Type assertion. Requires `Type` to be non-primitive and contain generics, and is specifically about the generics part.\r\n* Boxing/Unboxing. Java automatically wraps a primitive into its boxed type, or unwraps the value out of a boxed type, as needed, depending on context. casting is one way to create this context.\r\n* Lambda/MethodRef selection. Lambdas/methodrefs are a compiler error unless, from context, the compiler can figure out what functional interface type the lambda/methodref is an implementation for. Casts are one way to establish this context.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe space you&#39;re currently playing in is the Type Coercion part. Note that neither type coercion nor assertion do any conversion. These do nothing at all at runtime (type assertion), or mostly nothing at all - type coercion, at runtime, either throws ClassCastEx, or does nothing. No conversion ever takes place. This doesn&#39;t work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNumber n = 5;\r\nString s = (String) n;\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne might think this results in the string `&quot;5&quot;`. That&#39;s not how casting works.\r\n\r\n## What is type coercion\r\n\r\nType coercion casting does 2 completely separate things:\r\n\r\n* Changes the type of an expression\r\n\r\nIn java, when you invoke a method, the compiler must figure out which exact method you mean and codes that into the bytecode. If the compiler can&#39;t figure out which one you want, it won&#39;t compile. The lookup is based on a combination of the method name as well as the parameter types - specifically, the _compile time type of them_.\r\n\r\n```\r\nNumber n = 5;\r\nfoo(n); // prints &#39;Number&#39;, not &#39;Integer&#39;!\r\n\r\nvoid foo(Number n) { System.out.println(&quot;Number variant&quot;); }\r\nvoid foo(Integer n) { System.out.println(&quot;Integer variant&quot;); }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHence, the type of _the expression itself_, as the compiler thinks of it, is important for this sort of thing. Casting changes the compile-time type. `foo((Integer) n)` would print &#39;Integer variant&#39;.\r\n\r\n* Check if its actually true\r\n\r\nThe second thing type coercion does, is generate bytecode that checks the claim. Given:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNumber n = getNumber();\r\nInteger i = (Integer) n;\r\n\r\nNumber getNumber() {\r\n  return new Double(5.5); // a double!\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen clearly we can tell: That type cast is not going to work out, `n` is not, in fact, pointing at an instance of Integer at all. However, at compile time we can&#39;t be sure: We&#39;d have to go through the code of `getNumber` to know, and given the halting problem, it&#39;s not possible for arbitrary code to be analysed like this. Even if it was, maybe tomorrow this code changes - signatures are set, but implementations can change.\r\n\r\nThus, the compiler will just let you write this, but will insert code that checks. This is the `CHECKCAST` bytecode instruction. That instruction does nothing if the cast holds (the value is indeed pointing at an object of the required type), _or_, if the object it is pointing at isn&#39;t, then a ClassCastException is thrown. Which should probably be called `TypeCoercionException` instead, and the bytecode should probably be called `CHECKTYPE`.\r\n\r\n### compiler error &#39;incompatible types&#39; vs ClassCastEx\r\n\r\nA type coercion cast comes in 3 flavours. That &#39;change the compile time type of the expression&#39; thing is common to all 3. But about the check if it&#39;s actually true thing, you have 3 options:\r\n\r\n* It is always true\r\n\r\nThis seems pointless:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInteger i = 5;\r\nNumber n = (Number) i;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it is - any linting tool worth its salt will point out this cast does absolutely nothing at all. The compiler knows it does nothing (all integers are also numbers, doing a runtime check is useless), and doesn&#39;t even generate the CHECKCAST bytecode. However, sometimes you do this solely for the fact that the type changes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInteger i = 5;\r\nfoo((Number) i); // would print &#39;Number variant&#39;, even though its an integer.\r\n```\r\n\r\nPoint is, this cast, while usually pointless, is technically legal; java just lets it happen and doesn&#39;t even generate the CHECKCAST. It cannot possibly throw anything at runtime.\r\n\r\n* It is always false\r\n\r\n```\r\nInteger i = 5;\r\nDouble d = (Double) i;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt compile time the compiler already knows this is never going to work. No type exists that it both `Integer` and `Double`. Technically, `null` would work, but nevertheless the java spec dictates that the compiler must _reject_ this code, and fail with a &#39;incompatible types&#39; compiler error. There are other ways to make the compiler emit this error message; this is just one of them.\r\n\r\n* The check may be true or false\r\n\r\nIn which case the compiler compiles it and adds a CHECKCAST bytecode instruction so that at runtime the type is checked. This could result in a ClassCastException.\r\n\r\n## The other way to get CCEx\r\n\r\ngenerics are entirely a compile time affair. The runtime has no idea what they mean. That means that this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nList&lt;String&gt; list = getListOfStrings();\r\nlist.get(0).toLowerCase();\r\n```\r\n\r\nis compiled to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nList list = getListOfStrings();\r\n((String) list.get(0)).toLowerCase();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe compiler injects a cast (and as the generics-erased List&#39;s `get` method returns `Object`, the test could pass, or fail, a `CHECKCAST` bytecode instruction is generated, which could throw ClassCastEx). This means you can cast ClassCastExceptions on lines with no casts, but then it does mean someone messed up their generics and ignored a compile time warning. This method would do the job:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic List&lt;String&gt; getListOfStrings() {\r\n  var broken = new ArrayList&lt;Number&gt;();\r\n  broken.add(5); // not a string\r\n  List raw = broken; // raw type.\r\n  return (List&lt;String&gt;) raw;\r\n}\r\n```","title":"ClassCastException vs &quot;Incompatible types&quot; in Java","body":"<p>The cast operator looks like this: <code>(Type) expression</code>.</p>\n<p>It used for 3 <strong>completely unrelated things</strong>, and due to the way java works, effectively, a 4th and 5th thing, though it's not the cast operation itself that causes it, it's merely a side-effect.

However, sometimes you do this solely for the fact that the type changes:</p>\n<pre><code>Integer i = 5;\nfoo((Number) i); // would print 'Number variant', even though its an integer.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Point is, this cast, while usually pointless, is technically legal; java just lets it happen and doesn't even generate the CHECKCAST. It cannot possibly throw anything at runtime.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is always false</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>Integer i = 5;\nDouble d = (Double) i;\n</code></pre>\n<p>At compile time the compiler already knows this is never going to work. No type exists that it both <code>Integer</code> and <code>Double</code>. Technically, <code>null</code> would work, but nevertheless the java spec dictates that the compiler must <em>reject</em> this code, and fail with a 'incompatible types' compiler error. There are other ways to make the compiler emit this error message; this is just one of them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The check may be true or false</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In which case the compiler compiles it and adds a CHECKCAST bytecode instruction so that at runtime the type is checked. This could result in a ClassCastException.</p>\n<h2>The other way to get CCEx</h2>\n<p>generics are entirely a compile time affair. The runtime has no idea what they mean. That means that this code:</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; list = getListOfStrings();\nlist.get(0).toLowerCase();\n</code></pre>\n<p>is compiled to:</p>\n<pre><code>List list = getListOfStrings();\n((String) list.get(0)).toLowerCase();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The compiler injects a cast (and as the generics-erased List's <code>get</code> method returns <code>Object</code>, the test could pass, or fail, a <code>CHECKCAST</code> bytecode instruction is generated, which could throw ClassCastEx). This means you can cast ClassCastExceptions on lines with no casts, but then it does mean someone messed up their generics and ignored a compile time warning. This method would do the job:</p>\n<pre><code>public List&lt;String&gt; getListOfStrings() {\n  var broken = new ArrayList&lt;Number&gt;();\n  broken.add(5); // not a string\n  List raw = broken; // raw type.\n  return (List&lt;String&gt;) raw;\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":12363423,"reputation":688,"user_id":14808001,"display_name":"Mario Mateaș"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":667,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":73816579,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1663857618,"creation_date":1663850922,"question_id":73814928,"body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been working on studying for the OCJA8 Java exam and started reading about Exceptions, especially about `ClassCastException`.

It'll run through 6 times, with the second line of the loop passing the 'x' values to the doStuff method for it to return a value.  The numbers I'm coming up with for the result don't match the actual result.  </p>\n\n<p>Any help here would be appreciated.  Please let me know if I'm thinking about it the wrong way.  If someone wants to reformat my code to align more closely with industry standards, it would be great to learn good habits from the start! </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","android-audiomanager"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2437979,"reputation":1980,"user_id":2127357,"accept_rate":90,"display_name":"CAPS LOCK"},"score":0,"creation_date":1590504467,"post_id":58044974,"comment_id":109700685,"body_markdown":"Any new updates about this glitch?","body":"Any new updates about this glitch?"},{"owner":{"account_id":10455387,"reputation":1093,"user_id":8387076,"display_name":"Wrichik Basu"},"score":0,"creation_date":1593555156,"post_id":58044974,"comment_id":110821947,"body_markdown":"@CAPSLOCK Nope, silent mode still triggers DND in Android N+.","body":"@CAPSLOCK Nope, silent mode still triggers DND in Android N+."}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":10588045,"reputation":303,"user_id":7799676,"display_name":"biqqles"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571609458,"creation_date":1571609458,"answer_id":58477760,"question_id":58044974,"body_markdown":"This indeed appears to be another all too familiar bug in Android, in that setting `RINGER_MODE_SILENT` doesn&#39;t do what the documentation says it should do.
