I know OpenID, it is the annotation which confuses me. So my first question is: \r\n\r\nDoes the `@OpenIdAuthenticationDefinition` mean that I have to annotate each of my CDI and EJB code using the JakaraEE security API? This would mean I have to rewrite many classes and third party libraries in my application? \r\n\r\nThe second question is more a conceptional about the design of my application: \r\n\r\nWhy should I pollute my code with an annotation that binds my code to a specific proprietary security layer?\r\nIt is one of the core concepts of Jakrata EE to write application code against the specification and not one specific implementation.

Its implementation reads:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    private void heapify() {\r\n        final Object[] es = queue;\r\n        int n = size, i = (n &gt;&gt;&gt; 1) - 1;\r\n        final Comparator&lt;? super E&gt; cmp;\r\n        if ((cmp = comparator) == null)\r\n            for (; i &gt;= 0; i--)\r\n                siftDownComparable(i, (E) es[i], es, n);\r\n        else\r\n            for (; i &gt;= 0; i--)\r\n                siftDownUsingComparator(i, (E) es[i], es, n, cmp);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n```\r\n    private static &lt;T&gt; void siftDownComparable(int k, T x, Object[] es, int n) {\r\n        // assert n &gt; 0;\r\n        Comparable&lt;? super T&gt; key = (Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;)x;\r\n        int half = n &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;           // loop while a non-leaf\r\n        while (k &lt; half) {\r\n            int child = (k &lt;&lt; 1) + 1; // assume left child is least\r\n            Object c = es[child];\r\n            int right = child + 1;\r\n            if (right &lt; n &amp;&amp;\r\n                ((Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;) c).compareTo((T) es[right]) &gt; 0)\r\n                c = es[child = right];\r\n            if (key.compareTo((T) c) &lt;= 0)\r\n                break;\r\n            es[k] = c;\r\n            k = child;\r\n        }\r\n        es[k] = key;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt first glance, it seems surprising that heapify should have linear complexity, because it calls `siftDown` `n/2` times, and `siftDown` requires up to `2 log2(n)` comparisons. But let&#39;s take a closer look: \r\n\r\nIn the worst case, heapify involves moving down each node until it is a leaf node. The cost therefore is the total distance of nodes from the leaves of the tree, or\r\n\r\n    n * h\r\n\r\nwhere `h` is the average distance from a leaf. What is that distance?\r\n\r\nSince a heap is a fully balanced tree, adding a new level of nodes to the tree  adds 1 to the distance of existing nodes, and then adds equally many nodes at distance 0, which halves the average distance:\r\n\r\n    h &lt;- (h + 1) / 2\r\n\r\nTo find what this recurrence relation converges to, we set\r\n\r\n    h = (h + 1) / 2\r\n    \r\nand obtain\r\n\r\n    2h = h + 1\r\n     h = 1\r\n\r\nThat is, the average distance from a leaf in an infinite fully balanced search tree is 1. And that&#39;s why `siftDown`, on average, needs constant time, and `heapify` is linear.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, if we `add()` a node, the following executes:\r\n\r\n    public boolean offer(E e) {\r\n        if (e == null)\r\n            throw new NullPointerException();\r\n        modCount++;\r\n        int i = size;\r\n        if (i &gt;= queue.length)\r\n            grow(i + 1);\r\n        siftUp(i, e);\r\n        size = i + 1;\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n    private void siftUp(int k, E x) {\r\n        if (comparator != null)\r\n            siftUpUsingComparator(k, x, queue, comparator);\r\n        else\r\n            siftUpComparable(k, x, queue);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static &lt;T&gt; void siftUpComparable(int k, T x, Object[] es) {\r\n        Comparable&lt;? super T&gt; key = (Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;) x;\r\n        while (k &gt; 0) {\r\n            int parent = (k - 1) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;\r\n            Object e = es[parent];\r\n            if (key.compareTo((T) e) &gt;= 0)\r\n                break;\r\n            es[k] = e;\r\n            k = parent;\r\n        }\r\n        es[k] = key;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the worst case, `add` moves every node all the way to the root.

But let's take a closer look:</p>\n<p>In the worst case, heapify involves moving down each node until it is a leaf node. The cost therefore is the total distance of nodes from the leaves of the tree, or</p>\n<pre><code>n * h\n</code></pre>\n<p>where <code>h</code> is the average distance from a leaf. What is that distance?</p>\n<p>Since a heap is a fully balanced tree, adding a new level of nodes to the tree  adds 1 to the distance of existing nodes, and then adds equally many nodes at distance 0, which halves the average distance:</p>\n<pre><code>h &lt;- (h + 1) / 2\n</code></pre>\n<p>To find what this recurrence relation converges to, we set</p>\n<pre><code>h = (h + 1) / 2\n</code></pre>\n<p>and obtain</p>\n<pre><code>2h = h + 1\n h = 1\n</code></pre>\n<p>That is, the average distance from a leaf in an infinite fully balanced search tree is 1. And that's why <code>siftDown</code>, on average, needs constant time, and <code>heapify</code> is linear.</p>\n<p>In contrast, if we <code>add()</code> a node, the following executes:</p>\n<pre><code>public boolean offer(E e) {\n    if (e == null)\n        throw new NullPointerException();\n    modCount++;\n    int i = size;\n    if (i &gt;= queue.length)\n        grow(i + 1);\n    siftUp(i, e);\n    size = i + 1;\n    return true;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>where</p>\n<pre><code>private void siftUp(int k, E x) {\n    if (comparator != null)\n        siftUpUsingComparator(k, x, queue, comparator);\n    else\n        siftUpComparable(k, x, queue);\n}\n\nprivate static &lt;T&gt; void siftUpComparable(int k, T x, Object[] es) {\n    Comparable&lt;? super T&gt; key = (Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;) x;\n    while (k &gt; 0) {\n        int parent = (k - 1) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;\n        Object e = es[parent];\n        if (key.compareTo((T) e) &gt;= 0)\n            break;\n        es[k] = e;\n        k = parent;\n    }\n    es[k] = key;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the worst case, <code>add</code> moves every node all the way to the root.

However, in your case you also want the file name for each file. Therefore, you can add the column `COLUMN_DISPLAY_NAME` to the query. This would retrieve the filename and document ID (which later you will convert it into Uri) in a single query and is much more efficient. There are also many other columns available such as file type, file size, and last modified time, which you may want to retrieve them as well.\r\n```java\r\nc = resolver.query(mUri, new String[] {\r\n        DocumentsContract.Document.COLUMN_DOCUMENT_ID,\r\n        DocumentsContract.Document.COLUMN_DISPLAY_NAME\r\n    }, null, null, null);\r\n```\r\nWithin the while loop, retrieve the filename by\r\n```java\r\nfinal String filename = c.getString(1);\r\n```\r\nThe above modified code is able to instantly retrieve the Uri and filename of a directory with 1000+ files.\r\n\r\nIn summary, my recommendation is to avoid using `DocumentFile` if you are working with more than just a few files. Instead use `ContentResolver#query()` to retrieve the Uri and other information by selecting multiple columns in the query. For file operations, use the static methods in the `DocumentsContract` class by passing the appropriate Uri&#39;s.\r\n\r\nBy the way, it seems that the `sortOrder` parameter of `ContentResolver#query()` gets completely ignored in the above code snippet when tested on Android 11 and Android 9. I would manually sort the results instead of relying on the query order.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/300475fc42431cefb0d8f1bfc70de1a7a052a501/documentfile/src/main/java/android/support/v4/provider/TreeDocumentFile.java","title":"Why is DocumentFile so slow, and what should I use instead?","body":"<p>If you read the <a href=\"https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/300475fc42431cefb0d8f1bfc70de1a7a052a501/documentfile/src/main/java/android/support/v4/provider/TreeDocumentFile.java\" rel=\"noreferrer\">source code</a> of <code>TreeDocumentFile</code>, you will find that each call to <code>listFiles()</code> and <code>getName()</code> invokes <code>ContentResolver#query()</code> under the hood.

There are also many other columns available such as file type, file size, and last modified time, which you may want to retrieve them as well.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>c = resolver.query(mUri, new String[] {\n        DocumentsContract.Document.COLUMN_DOCUMENT_ID,\n        DocumentsContract.Document.COLUMN_DISPLAY_NAME\n    }, null, null, null);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Within the while loop, retrieve the filename by</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>final String filename = c.getString(1);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above modified code is able to instantly retrieve the Uri and filename of a directory with 1000+ files.</p>\n<p>In summary, my recommendation is to avoid using <code>DocumentFile</code> if you are working with more than just a few files. Instead use <code>ContentResolver#query()</code> to retrieve the Uri and other information by selecting multiple columns in the query. For file operations, use the static methods in the <code>DocumentsContract</code> class by passing the appropriate Uri's.</p>\n<p>By the way, it seems that the <code>sortOrder</code> parameter of <code>ContentResolver#query()</code> gets completely ignored in the above code snippet when tested on Android 11 and Android 9. I would manually sort the results instead of relying on the query order.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":9172301,"reputation":4168,"user_id":6819340,"accept_rate":39,"display_name":"darshan"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1638725224,"creation_date":1638725224,"answer_id":70236775,"question_id":42186820,"body_markdown":"In case someone comes up here still looking for a solution,\\\r\nI built a wrapper over this with some pretty good performance.\r\n\r\nYou can check the wrapper &amp; performance info. here:\r\nhttps://github.com/ItzNotABug/DocumentFileCompat","title":"Why is DocumentFile so slow, and what should I use instead?","body":"<p>In case someone comes up here still looking for a solution,<br />\nI built a wrapper over this with some pretty good performance.</p>\n<p>You can check the wrapper &amp; performance info. here:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ItzNotABug/DocumentFileCompat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/ItzNotABug/DocumentFileCompat</a></p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1741886,"reputation":1520,"user_id":1593056,"display_name":"Hexise"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1685731569,"creation_date":1685729739,"answer_id":76392585,"question_id":42186820,"body_markdown":"Thanks to the answer from [@sincostan][1], I can create a replacement method for DocumentFile.findFile(), which should be much faster than original one(reduced lots of ContentResolver#query() from loop and DocumentFile#getName()).

I do not care about the client side CA/trust store etc. Can anybody help or tell me what I'm doing wrong or if I am misunderstanding the docs?</p>\n<p>Thank you all</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","file","store","internal-storage"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":50585,"reputation":39940,"user_id":150978,"accept_rate":78,"display_name":"Robert"},"score":1,"creation_date":1685651101,"post_id":76385455,"comment_id":134694388,"body_markdown":"I don&#39;t see any code where you try to write a file.
