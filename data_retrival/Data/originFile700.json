All you need to do is run your application and save a part of the running application&#39;s component tree as a GUI Designer form. From then on, you can use the GUI Designer to extend or modify the form.\r\n\r\nYou can work with the layout and code in the GUI Designer just as you do with Forms originally created with the GUI Designer.\r\n\r\n**To take a Snapshot of an existing dialog**\r\n\r\n1.Open the module that contains source code for the dialog you want to capture.\r\n\r\n2.Select the Application Run Configuration, make sure that the option Enable capturing form snapshots is checked, and run the application.\r\n\r\n3.In the running application, perform whatever interaction is necessary to open the dialog you want to capture.\r\n\r\n4.In the Project tool window, right-click the target package and choose New | Form Snapshot on the context menu. If the application is not yet running, IntelliJ IDEA prompts you to run it, and then prepare the application for taking snapshot:\r\n[enter image description here][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Create Form Snapshot dialog box appears.\r\n\r\n5.In the IntelliJ IDEA&#39;s Create Form Snapshot dialog, select the top-level component to be included in the snapshot, enter the form name, and click Create Snapshot button. The new form created this way is not bound to any class.

Try to understand the concepts, don&#39;t worry so much about what terms to use.\r\n\r\n## overriding\r\n\r\nIn java, for __methods only__ (not constructors, not fields), any type can define an entirely new method. A method has an &#39;identity&#39; and that identity is defined by both its name __as well as all its parameter types__, and at least at the class file level, even its return type. In contrast, if you define a method whose identity matches __exactly__ with a method identity from a class or interface that is a supertype, then you aren&#39;t defined a new method, you are __overriding__ the method from the supertype. At the language level (so, what `javac` does), a tightened return type is still an override (but that doesn&#39;t count for parameter types), and generics do not factor into this _at all_ (because at the runtime level, i.e. class files and `java.exe`, generics do not exist). So:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Parent {\r\n  Object foo(String a) {\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;In parent&quot;);\r\n    return null;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Child extends Parent {\r\n  String foo(String b) {\r\n // This is an override\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;In child&quot;);\r\n    return null;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nJava does &#39;dynamic dispatch&#39;, meaning: Whenever you invoke a method, the _most specific override available_ is actually invoked. It&#39;s about the actual type of the object that is referred to by your expression, and __not__ about the expression&#39;s type. Thus:\r\n\r\n```\r\nParent p = new Child();\r\np.foo(&quot;&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nprints &quot;In child&quot;. Even though the type of `p` is parent, if you follow the pointer, p turns out to actually be pointing at an instance of Child, and Child&#39;s `foo()` impl is more specific. And therefore, is used. You can&#39;t tell java not to do this - only Child itself could (by invoking `super.foo(a)` to explicitly invoke the parent&#39;s implementation of foo(). You can&#39;t do something like `p.super.foo(&quot;&quot;)`, that isn&#39;t legal java.\r\n\r\n## Overloading\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, the identity of a method _includes its parameter types_. Thus, given:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Parent {\r\n  void foo(String a) {\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;in Parent&quot;);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Child extends Parent {\r\n  void foo(Object b) {\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;in Child&quot;);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n__These are completely different methods__. As different as a method named &#39;jane&#39; and another method named &#39;aubrey&#39; - utterly, completely unrelated.\r\n\r\n```\r\nParent p = new Child();\r\np.foo(null);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat would compile and print &#39;In Parent&#39;. Because given that `p` is of type Parent, the only foo method that `foo(null)` could possibly be referring to, is the `foo(String)` method that is in Parent, so that is invoked. At runtime the system dutifully goes looking for the most specific implementation of it, which is Parent&#39;s foo - because the foo in child is a completely different method. After all, its identity doesn&#39;t match.\r\n\r\nIf you tried this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nChild c = new Child();\r\nc.foo(null);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are 2 completely different methods but either one could feasibly be called. Javac will refuse to compile it and tell you this is an ambiguous method invocation (javac isn&#39;t clear which one you wanted). The key difference is that in this second example, there are 2 different methods, whereas in the first (where we are overriding), there is only one method identity, and 2 implementations of that identity.\r\n\r\nGiven that these are 2 different methods, it&#39;s the compiler that needs to translate `p.foo()` into a class file, and as part of that job, it needs to name the full method identity of what you are attempting to invoke: Javac figures out which of a bunch of overloads you meant to call.\r\n\r\nSo, which one is polymorphism?\r\n\r\nThat depends entirely on what you mean by &#39;polymorphism&#39;. The java lang spec doesn&#39;t use that word, a java programmer therefore doesn&#39;t need to care about that word. The first example is overriding. The second is overloading.

Go down the array, subtracting the probability from the random number. When it is &lt;= 0, that is your random choice.\nTo remove from the pool, subtract 1 from the chance of what you landed on, and 1 from the sum. When the sum is zero, that means the pool is empty and can be refilled.

I&#39;ll jump directly to a workaround proposal.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWhenever you are facing problems with Java-Scala interop while trying to call Scala code from Java, there is a simple, while maybe somewhat heavyweight workaround, that works in essentially every situation.\r\n\r\n###TL;DR\r\n\r\nIf instantiating Scala entities in Java code does not work, hide everything behind a Java-interface, and implement this interface in Scala.\r\n\r\n###Workaround proposal\r\n\r\nIf you are using some mainstream Scala framework, it probably \r\nhas a completely separate Java API (e.g. Spark, Akka, Play), then\r\n*please use that*!\r\n\r\nIf it is a less known Scala software package without a separate\r\nJava API, do the following:\r\n\r\n  1. Write down a minimal, clean user-facing API in pure Java\r\n  2. Provide framework-facing interfaces in Java\r\n  3. Implement the Java interfaces in Scala\r\n  4. Provide an entry point to the Java API implementation\r\n  5. Use the pure-Java API in your Java code\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t want to implement a full Java API, you can use this approach locally, to deal with those parts of Scala code that don&#39;t work seamlessly with your Java project.\r\n\r\nWhy it should work: Scala can easily express everything that Java can express, whereas Java has no mechanisms for interpreting most of the Scala constructs (the entire metaprogramming subsystem - `given`s/`using`/`derives`/`inline` etc., as well as the whole type-inference machinery, simply have no corresponding counterparts on the `javac` side). Therefore, it&#39;s much easier to implement Java-interfaces in Scala than using any Scala code from Java.\r\n\r\nHere is how this pattern can be applied to your example (I extended it a bit to make it non-trivial):\r\n\r\n*Note that class names are somewhat ugly, I did that only to omit the package declarations, so that all the files can be dumped in src/main/{scala,java}; Don&#39;t do this in real implementation.*\r\n\r\n**Step 0:** Look at the third-party Scala library\r\n\r\nSuppose that this is our third-party Scala library, that\r\nhas `superImportantMethod`s and computes `superImportantThings`:\r\n\r\n    /* Suppose that this is the external Scala library \r\n     * that you cannot change.\r\n     * A = Outer\r\n     * B = Inner\r\n     * \r\n     * + I added at least one member and one\r\n     * method, so that it&#39;s not so boring and trivial\r\n     */\r\n\r\n    class A {\r\n      var superImportantMemberOfA: Int = 42\r\n      class B[T](t: T) {\r\n        def superImportantMethod: String = t + &quot;&quot; + superImportantMemberOfA\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Step 1/2:** Minimal Java API for use in your Java project\r\n\r\nWe will use these interfaces in our java project, and implement them\r\nusing Scala directly:\r\n\r\n    interface A_j {\r\n      &lt;X&gt; B_j&lt;X&gt; createB(X x);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    interface B_j&lt;X&gt; {\r\n      String superImportantMethod();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Step 3: Implement the interfaces in Scala**\r\n\r\n\r\n    /** Implementation of the java api in \r\n      * Scala\r\n      */\r\n    class A_javaApiImpl extends A_j {\r\n      private val wrappedA: A = new A\r\n    \r\n      private class B_javaApiImpl[X](val x: X) extends B_j[X] {\r\n        private val wrappedB: wrappedA.B[X] = new wrappedA.B[X](x)\r\n        def superImportantMethod: String = wrappedB.superImportantMethod\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      def createB[X](x: X): B_j[X] = new B_javaApiImpl[X](x)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Step 4:** provide an entry point to the API\r\n\r\n    /** Some kind of entry point to the \r\n      * java API.\r\n      */\r\n    object JavaApi {\r\n      def createA: A_j = new A_javaApiImpl\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Step 5:** Use the java-only API in your Java code:\r\n\r\n    public class JavaMain {\r\n      public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\r\n        // Use the Java API in your Java application\r\n        // Notice that now all A_j&#39;s and B_j&#39;s are\r\n        // pure Java interfaces, so that nothing \r\n        // should go wrong.\r\n        A_j a = JavaApi.createA(); // the only call of a Scala-method.\r\n        B_j&lt;String&gt; b = a.createB(&quot;foobarbaz&quot;);\r\n        System.out.println(b.superImportantMethod());\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nNow nothing should go wrong, because Java (almost) never calls any\r\nScala methods or constructors, and by defining a clean API you also \r\nhave a guarantee that you will not run into any problems because\r\nsome Scala concepts cannot be represented in Java.

Therefore, it's much easier to implement Java-interfaces in Scala than using any Scala code from Java.</p>\n<p>Here is how this pattern can be applied to your example (I extended it a bit to make it non-trivial):</p>\n<p><em>Note that class names are somewhat ugly, I did that only to omit the package declarations, so that all the files can be dumped in src/main/{scala,java}; Don't do this in real implementation.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Step 0:</strong> Look at the third-party Scala library</p>\n<p>Suppose that this is our third-party Scala library, that\nhas <code>superImportantMethod</code>s and computes <code>superImportantThings</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>/* Suppose that this is the external Scala library \n * that you cannot change.\n * A = Outer\n * B = Inner\n * \n * + I added at least one member and one\n * method, so that it's not so boring and trivial\n */\n\nclass A {\n  var superImportantMemberOfA: Int = 42\n  class B[T](t: T) {\n    def superImportantMethod: String = t + &quot;&quot; + superImportantMemberOfA\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Step 1/2:</strong> Minimal Java API for use in your Java project</p>\n<p>We will use these interfaces in our java project, and implement them\nusing Scala directly:</p>\n<pre><code>interface A_j {\n  &lt;X&gt; B_j&lt;X&gt; createB(X x);\n}\n\ninterface B_j&lt;X&gt; {\n  String superImportantMethod();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Implement the interfaces in Scala</strong></p>\n<pre><code>/** Implementation of the java api in \n  * Scala\n  */\nclass A_javaApiImpl extends A_j {\n  private val wrappedA: A = new A\n\n  private class B_javaApiImpl[X](val x: X) extends B_j[X] {\n    private val wrappedB: wrappedA.B[X] = new wrappedA.B[X](x)\n    def superImportantMethod: String = wrappedB.superImportantMethod\n  }\n\n  def createB[X](x: X): B_j[X] = new B_javaApiImpl[X](x)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> provide an entry point to the API</p>\n<pre><code>/** Some kind of entry point to the \n  * java API.\n  */\nobject JavaApi {\n  def createA: A_j = new A_javaApiImpl\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Use the java-only API in your Java code:</p>\n<pre><code>public class JavaMain {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n    // Use the Java API in your Java application\n    // Notice that now all A_j's and B_j's are\n    // pure Java interfaces, so that nothing \n    // should go wrong.\n    A_j a = JavaApi.createA(); // the only call of a Scala-method.\n    B_j&lt;String&gt; b = a.createB(&quot;foobarbaz&quot;);\n    System.out.println(b.superImportantMethod());\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now nothing should go wrong, because Java (almost) never calls any\nScala methods or constructors, and by defining a clean API you also\nhave a guarantee that you will not run into any problems because\nsome Scala concepts cannot be represented in Java. Indeed, it does\ncompile and run:</p>\n<pre><code> [info] Running (fork) JavaMain \n [info] foobarbaz42\n</code></pre>\n<p>###Appendix I\n###(Failed) attempt to instantiate generic inner Scala classes from Java</p>\n<p>I started with these definitions (slightly abbreviated code from your question):</p>\n<p>.scala:</p>\n<pre><code>class A {\n  class B[T]\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>.java:</p>\n<pre><code>public class JavaMain {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    A a = new A();\n    A.B&lt;String&gt; b = a.new B&lt;String&gt;(a);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that the javac compiler required a parameter of type <code>A</code> for the <code>B</code> constructor,\nwhich already was somewhat suspicious, and not really intuitive.</p>\n<p>It compiled, but when I tried to run it, I got the following cryptic error message:</p>\n<p>[error] Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: A$B.(LA;LA;)V\n[error]         at JavaMain.main(JavaMain.java:4)</p>\n<p>I had absolutely no clue what this is supposed to mean, so I decompiled the generated\n&quot;.class&quot;-files:</p>\n<p>Decompiled A.class:</p>\n<pre><code>public class A {\n\n    public class B&lt;T&gt; {\n        public /* synthetic */ A A$B$$$outer() {\n            return A.this;\n        }\n\n        public B() {\n            if (A.this == null) {\n                throw null;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Decompiled A$B.class:</p>\n<pre><code>public class A.B&lt;T&gt; {\n    public /* synthetic */ A A$B$$$outer() {\n        return A.this;\n    }\n\n    public A.B() {\n        if (A.this == null) {\n            throw null;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Decompiled JavaMain.class:</p>\n<pre><code>public class JavaMain {\n    public static void main(String[] arrstring) {\n        A a;\n        A a2 = a = new A();\n        a2.getClass();\n        A.B b = new A.B(a2, a);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>new A.B(a2, a)</code>\npart doesn't even look like valid java to me (and neither to\nthe javac). So, what I'm essentially trying to say: everything\ncrashes and burns and I don't know why. Therefore, I would\nsimply advise to implement the workaround described above.</p>\n<p>Hope that helps.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":5502972,"reputation":3853,"user_id":4371758,"display_name":"Bubletan"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1518843988,"creation_date":1518839089,"answer_id":48837686,"question_id":48835404,"body_markdown":"This looks like a bug to me.

If the server do not response for 10 seconds and the server is offline, I want to store the data in the sqlite database.\r\n\r\nI have been told that I should use multi thread and I should also use retrofit. I am not sure if it would be possible to use `HttpUrlConnection` method with multi thread to connect to the server and upload the files.\r\n\r\nCan you please show me an example of what is the best way I could use to get instantly call to a function and connect to the server using with `HttpUrlConnection` if that is possible??\r\n","title":"Uploading a file from android take ages before calling a function","body":"<p>I'm having a hard time with calling a function when I select on the files.</p>\n<p>When I select on a file, it start to take like 10 seconds before it start to call the <code>UploadFile</code> function and then connect to the server, so when I select more files to add, it will take like a minute or so before it start to call the <code>UploadFile</code> function and connect to the server which is wrong.

Only deserialize properties that are explicitly provided by `A.class`\r\n2. Use a MixIn to ignore all *unwanted, known* properties. So for example, I know that `unwantedProperty` is part of the JSON, but I don&#39;t need it, so I want to ignore it.\r\n3. Still raise an `UnrecognizedPropertyException` if a *new, unknown* property suddenly appears in my JSON.\r\n\r\nThe reason that I wish to use something like a MixIn class for this is that in reality, the input JSON has several dozens of fields. I would prefer not to clutter my `A.class` with dozens and dozens of unused properties with `@JsonIgnore` on them, so that it only contains the fields that I *really* want. If a new property unexpectedly does come along, I want to be forced to have a look at it.\r\n\r\nI thought that I could allow this behaviour by using a MixIn as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic abstract class AMixIn {\r\n    @JsonIgnore private String unwantedProperty;\r\n```\r\n\r\ntogether with:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nobjectMapper.addMixIn(A.class, AMixIn.class);\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this seemingly has no effect.
