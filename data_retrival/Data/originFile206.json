So far it&#39;s looking good but now you have `nums1[k]` with value `3` and `nums2[l]` with value `2` so you&#39;re setting `nums1[i]=nums2[l]`, i.e. `nums1[2]=nums2[0]`. This way you&#39;re replacing `3` in `nums1` with `2` from `nums2` so you just lost your `3` from original `nums1` and you won&#39;t be able to put it in the final array.\r\n\r\nThere are two solutions to this issue:\r\n\r\n 1. Auxillary (temporary) array where you will put your numbers and in the end this array will be merged and sorted arrays of nums1 and nums2 so you can then just copy this array into nums1 to have all the numbers merged and sorted in nums1.\r\n 2.

This ensures that only a site that has access to the CSRF token can connect. Since only the same origin can access the CSRF token, external domains are not allowed to make a connection.\r\n\r\nSpring Security 4.0 has introduced authorization support for WebSockets through the Spring Messaging abstraction.\r\n\r\nIn Spring Security 5.8, this support has been refreshed to use the AuthorizationManager API.\r\n\r\nTo configure authorization using Java Configuration, simply include the `@EnableWebSocketSecurity` annotation and publish an `AuthorizationManager&lt;Message&lt;?&gt;&gt;` bean or in XML use the `use-authorization-manager` attribute. One way to do this is by using the `AuthorizationManagerMessageMatcherRegistry` to specify endpoint patterns like so:\r\n\r\n    @Configuration\r\n    @EnableWebSocketSecurity\r\n\r\n    public class WebSocketSecurityConfig {\r\n    @Bean\r\n    AuthorizationManager&lt;Message&lt;?&gt;&gt; messageAuthorizationManager(MessageMatcherDelegatingAuthorizationManager.Builder messages) {\r\n        messages\r\n                .simpDestMatchers(&quot;/user/**&quot;).authenticated()\r\n\r\n        return messages.build();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n1. Any inbound CONNECT message requires a valid CSRF token to enforce the [Same Origin Policy][1].\r\n2. The SecurityContextHolder is populated with the user within the simpUser header attribute for any inbound request.\r\n3. Our messages require the proper authorization. Specifically, any inbound message that starts with &quot;/user/&quot; will require ROLE_USER. Additional details on authorization can be found in [websocket-authorization]\r\n\r\n&gt; At this point, CSRF is not configurable when using `@EnableWebSocketSecurity`, though this will likely be added in a future release.\r\n\r\nTo disable CSRF, instead of using `@EnableWebSocketSecurity`, you can use XML support or add the Spring Security components yourself, like so:\r\n\r\n*Java*\r\n\r\n    @Configuration\r\n    public class WebSocketSecurityConfig implements WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void addArgumentResolvers(List&lt;HandlerMethodArgumentResolver&gt; argumentResolvers) {\r\n            argumentResolvers.add(new AuthenticationPrincipalArgumentResolver());\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void configureClientInboundChannel(ChannelRegistration registration) {\r\n            AuthorizationManager&lt;Message&lt;?&gt;&gt; myAuthorizationRules = AuthenticatedAuthorizationManager.authenticated();\r\n            AuthorizationChannelInterceptor authz = new AuthorizationChannelInterceptor(myAuthorizationRules);\r\n            AuthorizationEventPublisher publisher = new SpringAuthorizationEventPublisher(this.context);\r\n            authz.setAuthorizationEventPublisher(publisher);\r\n            registration.interceptors(new SecurityContextChannelInterceptor(), authz);\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n*web.xml*\r\n\r\n    &lt;websocket-message-broker use-authorization-manager=&quot;true&quot; same-origin-disabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;intercept-message pattern=&quot;/**&quot; access=&quot;authenticated&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/websocket-message-broker&gt;\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you are using the [legacy-websocket-configuration][2] and you want to allow other domains to access your site, you can disable Spring Security’s protection. For example, in Java Configuration you can use the following:\r\n\r\n    @Configuration\r\n    public class WebSocketSecurityConfig extends AbstractSecurityWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        protected boolean sameOriginDisabled() {\r\n            return true;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n ----------\r\n**References**\r\n- [WebSocket Security - Spring Security][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/integrations/websocket.html#websocket-sameorigin\r\n  [2]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/integrations/websocket.html#legacy%20%3Ccode%3EAbstractSecurityWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer%3C/code%3E\r\n  [3]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/integrations/websocket.html","title":"Setting up CSRF for spring websocket","body":"<p>By default, Spring Security requires the CSRF token in any CONNECT message type.

Additional details on authorization can be found in [websocket-authorization]</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At this point, CSRF is not configurable when using <code>@EnableWebSocketSecurity</code>, though this will likely be added in a future release.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To disable CSRF, instead of using <code>@EnableWebSocketSecurity</code>, you can use XML support or add the Spring Security components yourself, like so:</p>\n<p><em>Java</em></p>\n<pre><code>@Configuration\npublic class WebSocketSecurityConfig implements WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {\n    @Override\n    public void addArgumentResolvers(List&lt;HandlerMethodArgumentResolver&gt; argumentResolvers) {\n        argumentResolvers.add(new AuthenticationPrincipalArgumentResolver());\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void configureClientInboundChannel(ChannelRegistration registration) {\n        AuthorizationManager&lt;Message&lt;?&gt;&gt; myAuthorizationRules = AuthenticatedAuthorizationManager.authenticated();\n        AuthorizationChannelInterceptor authz = new AuthorizationChannelInterceptor(myAuthorizationRules);\n        AuthorizationEventPublisher publisher = new SpringAuthorizationEventPublisher(this.context);\n        authz.setAuthorizationEventPublisher(publisher);\n        registration.interceptors(new SecurityContextChannelInterceptor(), authz);\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>web.xml</em></p>\n<pre><code>&lt;websocket-message-broker use-authorization-manager=&quot;true&quot; same-origin-disabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;intercept-message pattern=&quot;/**&quot; access=&quot;authenticated&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;/websocket-message-broker&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>On the other hand, if you are using the <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/integrations/websocket.html#legacy%20%3Ccode%3EAbstractSecurityWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer%3C/code%3E\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">legacy-websocket-configuration</a> and you want to allow other domains to access your site, you can disable Spring Security’s protection.

This will result in compiler error - \"<em>Local variable i defined in an enclosing scope must be final or effectively final</em>\"</p>\n\n<pre><code>@FunctionalInterface\ninterface IFuncInt {\n    int func(int num1, int num2);\n    public String toString();\n}\n\npublic class LambdaVarDemo {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args){             \n        int i = 7;\n        IFuncInt funcInt = (num1, num2) -&gt; {\n            i = num1 + num2;\n            return i;\n        };\n    }   \n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":210996,"reputation":8398,"user_id":462923,"accept_rate":76,"display_name":"Ajeet Ganga"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":40,"is_accepted":false,"score":39,"last_activity_date":1559779696,"creation_date":1447629280,"answer_id":33726267,"question_id":20938095,"body_markdown":"&#39;Effectively final&#39; is a variable which would not give compiler error if it were to be appended by &#39;final&#39;\r\n\r\nFrom a article by &#39;Brian Goetz&#39;,\r\n\r\n&gt; Informally, a local variable is effectively final if its initial value is never changed -- in other words, declaring it final would not cause a compilation failure.\r\n\r\n[lambda-state-final- Brian Goetz][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/lambda/lambda-state-final.html","title":"Difference between final and effectively final","body":"<p>'Effectively final' is a variable which would not give compiler error if it were to be appended by 'final'</p>\n\n<p>From a article by 'Brian Goetz',</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Informally, a local variable is effectively final if its initial value is never changed -- in other words, declaring it final would not cause a compilation failure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/lambda/lambda-state-final.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">lambda-state-final- Brian Goetz</a></p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4774641,"reputation":3150,"user_id":3858203,"accept_rate":30,"display_name":"samadadi"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":12,"is_accepted":false,"score":12,"last_activity_date":1576557672,"creation_date":1449503786,"answer_id":34137804,"question_id":20938095,"body_markdown":"A variable is **final** or **effectively final** when **it&#39;s initialized once** and it&#39;s never **mutated** in its owner class.

During the installation of an executable (Exe), I&#39;m required to set up an environment variable for MongoDB. My objective is to create a Windows service for MongoDB, but before doing so, I need to add an environment variable for it. To achieve this, I&#39;ve followed the following steps in my Inno Setup script:\r\n\r\n1. In the CurStepChanged event for `ssInstall`, I&#39;m adding the MongoDB environment variable using EnvRemoveAddPath function. The environment variable appears to be set correctly.\r\n\r\n2. In the CurStepChanged event for `ssPostInstall`, I&#39;m refreshing the environment variables using the RefreshEnvironment function.\r\n\r\n3. I proceed to perform the necessary logic, including creating the Windows service for MongoDB.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, when I attempt to configure MongoDB using the command `mongod --dbpath &lt;{app}\\database\\path&gt;` during the service configuration, I encounter the error message: `&#39;mongod&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file`.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrangely, after this error occurs, I manually check the environment variable settings for MongoDB, and they appear to be set correctly. Furthermore, when I use the `echo %path%` command in the CMD, I can see that the MongoDB variable is indeed present. Despite this, during the execution of the installer, the error persists.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me understand why this issue is occurring and how I can resolve it? Thank you for your assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\nI provided my code please check it.\r\n\r\n``` none\r\n; Script generated by the Inno Setup Script Wizard.\r\n; SEE THE DOCUMENTATION FOR DETAILS ON CREATING INNO SETUP SCRIPT FILES!\r\n\r\n#define MyAppName &quot;envVarIssue&quot;\r\n#define MyAppVersion &quot;1.5&quot;\r\n#define MyAppPublisher &quot;My Company, Inc.&quot;\r\n#define MyAppURL &quot;https://www.example.com/&quot;\r\n#define MyAppExeName &quot;MyProg.exe&quot;\r\n#define MyAppAssocName MyAppName + &quot; File&quot;\r\n#define MyAppAssocExt &quot;.myp&quot;\r\n#define MyAppAssocKey StringChange(MyAppAssocName, &quot; &quot;, &quot;&quot;) + MyAppAssocExt\r\n\r\n#define MyAppParentPath &quot;.&quot;\r\n\r\n[Setup]\r\nSetupLogging=yes\r\nChangesEnvironment=yes\r\n\r\n; NOTE: The value of AppId uniquely identifies this application.

During the installation of an executable (Exe), I'm required to set up an environment variable for MongoDB. My objective is to create a Windows service for MongoDB, but before doing so, I need to add an environment variable for it. To achieve this, I've followed the following steps in my Inno Setup script:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>In the CurStepChanged event for <code>ssInstall</code>, I'm adding the MongoDB environment variable using EnvRemoveAddPath function. The environment variable appears to be set correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In the CurStepChanged event for <code>ssPostInstall</code>, I'm refreshing the environment variables using the RefreshEnvironment function.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I proceed to perform the necessary logic, including creating the Windows service for MongoDB.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, when I attempt to configure MongoDB using the command <code>mongod --dbpath &lt;{app}\\database\\path&gt;</code> during the service configuration, I encounter the error message: <code>'mongod' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file</code>.</p>\n<p>Strangely, after this error occurs, I manually check the environment variable settings for MongoDB, and they appear to be set correctly. Furthermore, when I use the <code>echo %path%</code> command in the CMD, I can see that the MongoDB variable is indeed present. Despite this, during the execution of the installer, the error persists.</p>\n<p>Can anyone help me understand why this issue is occurring and how I can resolve it?
