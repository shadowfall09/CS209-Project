Oh, and we probably need the current weight and clarity to stick around between loop iterations. Once we&#39;ve done this, it&#39;s easy to move the current values into the previous values if it&#39;s not the first time through.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport java.util.Scanner;\r\n\r\npublic class Diamonds {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n\r\n        int numOfIterations = scanner.nextInt();\r\n\r\n        float prevWeight  = 0.0;\r\n        float prevClarity = 0.0;\r\n        float curWeight   = 0.0;\r\n        float curClarity  = 0.0;\r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {\r\n            if (i &gt; 0) {\r\n                prevWeight  = curWeight;\r\n                prevClarity = curClarity;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            curWeight = scan.nextFloat();\r\n            curClarity = scan.nextFloat();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we can compare them. We&#39;ll need a place to store our &quot;streak&quot; of better diamonds. An `int` will do. We can increment it if the current diamond is better, or reset it to zero if it&#39;s not.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport java.util.Scanner;\r\n\r\npublic class Diamonds {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n\r\n        int numOfIterations = scanner.nextInt();\r\n\r\n        float prevWeight  = 0.0;\r\n        float prevClarity = 0.0;\r\n        float curWeight   = 0.0;\r\n        float curClarity  = 0.0;\r\n\r\n        int streak = 0;\r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {\r\n            if (i &gt; 0) {\r\n                prevWeight  = curWeight;\r\n                prevClarity = curClarity;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            curWeight = scan.nextFloat();\r\n            curClarity = scan.nextFloat();\r\n\r\n            if (curWeigt &gt; prevWeight &amp;&amp; curClarity &gt; prevClarity) {\r\n                streak++;\r\n            }\r\n            else {\r\n                streak = 0;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this will only let us track the current streak, not the longest one. For that, we need logic to compare the current streak length to the existing maximum, and to modify the maximum if a new max has been reached.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport java.util.Scanner;\r\n\r\npublic class Diamonds {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n\r\n        int numOfIterations = scanner.nextInt();\r\n\r\n        float prevWeight  = 0.0;\r\n        float prevClarity = 0.0;\r\n        float curWeight   = 0.0;\r\n        float curClarity  = 0.0;\r\n\r\n        int curStreak = 0;\r\n        int maxStreak = 0;\r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {\r\n            if (i &gt; 0) {\r\n                prevWeight  = curWeight;\r\n                prevClarity = curClarity;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            curWeight = scan.nextFloat();\r\n            curClarity = scan.nextFloat();\r\n\r\n            if (curWeigt &gt; prevWeight &amp;&amp; curClarity &gt; prevClarity) {\r\n                streak++;\r\n            }\r\n            else {\r\n                streak = 0;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            if (curStreak &gt; maxStreak) {\r\n                maxStreak = curStreak;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","title":"How to compare two sets of floats to another two sets of floats?","body":"<p><em>Some good answers, but perhaps beyond the level of the OP.

One of the major reasons for using a proxy server is to allow HTTP requests from within a corporate network to pass through a corporate firewall. The firewall will typically block most access to the Internet, but will allow requests from the proxy server to pass through. In addition, a mail server inside the corporate network will perform a similar function for email, accepting messages via SMTP and forwarding them to their ultimate destination on the Internet, and accepting incoming messages and sending them to the appropriate internal mail server. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nUpdate\r\n\r\n&gt;  Q: How do I configure JavaMail to work through my proxy server? [updated!]\r\n\r\n&gt;A: Starting with JavaMail 1.6.0, JavaMail supports accessing mail servers through a web proxy server. Set the &quot;mail.protocol.proxy.host&quot; and &quot;mail.protocol.proxy.port&quot; properties for the proxy server. Proxy server BASIC authentication is supported by setting the &quot;mail.protocol.proxy.user&quot; and &quot;mail.protocol.proxy.password&quot; properties.\r\n\r\n&gt;In addition, if your proxy server supports the SOCKS V4 or V5 protocol (http://www.socks.nec.com/aboutsocks.html, RFC1928) and allows anonymous connections, and you&#39;re using JDK 1.5 or newer and JavaMail 1.4.5 or newer, you can configure a SOCKS proxy on a per-session, per-protocol basis by setting the &quot;mail.smtp.socks.host&quot; property as described in the javadocs for the com.sun.mail.smtp package. Similar properties exist for the &quot;imap&quot; and &quot;pop3&quot; protocols. Authentication for SOCKS servers is supported by the JDK by setting the &quot;java.net.socks.username&quot; and &quot;java.net.socks.password&quot; System properties (and thus apply to all SOCKS connections) as describe in the JDK Networking Properties documentation.\r\n\r\n&gt;If you&#39;re using older versions of the JDK or JavaMail, you can tell the Java runtime to direct all TCP socket connections to the SOCKS server. See the Networking Properties guide for the latest documentation of the socksProxyHost and socksProxyPort properties. These are system-level properties, not JavaMail session properties. They can be set from the command line when the application is invoked, for example: java -DsocksProxyHost=myproxy .... This facility can be used to direct the SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 communication from JavaMail to the SOCKS proxy server. Note that setting these properties directs all TCP sockets to the SOCKS proxy, which may have negative impact on other aspects of your application.\r\n\r\n&gt;When using older versions of JavaMail, and without such a SOCKS server, if you want to use JavaMail to access mail servers outside the firewall indirectly, you might be able to use a program such as connect to tunnel TCP connections through an HTTP proxy server. Configure JavaMail to use the connect instance as the SOCKS server. \r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/faq-135477.html#proxy","title":"Java Mail Exception Error;","body":"<p>If you are under a proxy I think you can't use Java Mail.</p>\n<p>From : <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/faq-135477.html#proxy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">oracle.com</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Q: How do I configure JavaMail to work through my proxy server?</p>\n<p>A: JavaMail does not currently support accessing mail servers through a web proxy server.
