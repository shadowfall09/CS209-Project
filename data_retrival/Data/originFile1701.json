An interesting information we should maintain is the position of the other player at this time. So our state for time `Ti` consists of either of `{P1, P2}` and the location of the other player. Now, we want to incrementally calculate the minimum distance for every point in time and every possible state by computing the following table (using your first example):\r\n\r\n                 T1   T2   T3   T4\r\n    ----------+--------------------\r\n    P1; P2@p2 |  0\r\n    P1; P2@B1 |\r\n    P1; P2@B2 |\r\n    P1; P2@B3 |\r\n    P2; P1@p1 |  5\r\n    P2; P1@B1 |\r\n    P2; P1@B2 |\r\n    P2; P1@B3 |\r\nThe two initial values are the distances between `p1` and `B1` and `p2` and `B1`, respectively.\r\n\r\nFrom every state, we can go directly to the right neighboring cell.

This means that the other player picked up the last ball and the current player could be anywhere. So we have to find the minimum distance of all possible locations of the current player to the current ball. I&#39;ll give a visualization of this at the end of this post. This way, we can fill the entire table column by column:\r\n\r\nExample (again from your question)\r\n\r\n    p1 = (1, 1)\r\n    p2 = (3, 4) \r\n    B(1) = (1, 1)\r\n    B(2) = (2, 1)\r\n    B(3) = (3, 1)\r\n    B(4) = (5, 5)\r\nDP table:\r\n\r\n                 T1   T2            T3               T4\r\n    ----------+---------------------------------------------------------\r\n    P1; P2@p2 |  0    0+1=2         1+1=2            2+6=8\r\n    P1; P2@B1 |       min(5+1)=6    6+1=7            7+6=13\r\n    P1; P2@B2 |                     min(6+2,4+2)=6   6+6=12\r\n    P1; P2@B3 |                                      min(7+8,5+8,4+7)=11\r\n    P2; P1@p1 |  5   5+1=6          6+1=7            7+6=13\r\n    P2; P1@B1 |      min(0+4)=4     4+1=5            5+6=11\r\n    P2; P1@B2 |                     min(1+3,6+2)=4   4+6=10\r\n    P2; P1@B3 |                                      min(2+3,7+8,6+7)=5\r\nThe minimum in the last column is **5** (i.e. the minimum distance to collect all balls is 5).

This way, we can fill the entire table column by column:</p>\n\n<p>Example (again from your question)</p>\n\n<pre><code>p1 = (1, 1)\np2 = (3, 4) \nB(1) = (1, 1)\nB(2) = (2, 1)\nB(3) = (3, 1)\nB(4) = (5, 5)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>DP table:</p>\n\n<pre><code>             T1   T2            T3               T4\n----------+---------------------------------------------------------\nP1; P2@p2 |  0    0+1=2         1+1=2            2+6=8\nP1; P2@B1 |       min(5+1)=6    6+1=7            7+6=13\nP1; P2@B2 |                     min(6+2,4+2)=6   6+6=12\nP1; P2@B3 |                                      min(7+8,5+8,4+7)=11\nP2; P1@p1 |  5   5+1=6          6+1=7            7+6=13\nP2; P1@B1 |      min(0+4)=4     4+1=5            5+6=11\nP2; P1@B2 |                     min(1+3,6+2)=4   4+6=10\nP2; P1@B3 |                                      min(2+3,7+8,6+7)=5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The minimum in the last column is <strong>5</strong> (i.e. the minimum distance to collect all balls is 5). Tracing back, we get: P2@B4, P1@B3, P1@B2, P1@B1.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the promised visualization. The diagonal dependencies for the last column have been omitted for reasons of clarity:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tw3de.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tw3de.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I won't provide pseudo-code since it is very likely that I would mix up some indexing (leading to more confusion than help). But you should be able to write the code from the description above.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2318302,"reputation":23679,"user_id":2034787,"accept_rate":53,"display_name":"גלעד ברקן"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1475438125,"creation_date":1475436228,"answer_id":39820757,"question_id":39805584,"body_markdown":"Here&#39;s an implementation of an `O(n^2)` dynamic programming, similar to Nico&#39;s answer.

It is one of many protocols defining how data is transferred over the world wide web (a term that is often confused with &quot;internet&quot;).  The most recognizable aspect of the HTTP application protocol is the `http:` you see before a URI.  **However**, that `http:` you see is not the protocol, it is the scheme.  The scheme is a piece of the protocol, but is not the protocol. In that case it might be apt to have the following string literal constant.\r\n\r\n    final String SCHEME = &quot;http&quot;;\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you were writing some type of service client that works over multiple protocols, you might want to specify a default one.

Utilizing it for something else violates the single purpose principal of software engineering.  To be more pragmatic, the HttpHost class could change their default scheme (maybe) without you changing your default scheme.  This would obviously be an issue.

Also the same with NestedScrollView instead of the CardView.</p>\n<p>But in all cases this leads to nested constraint layouts. Particuallary in one screen I use the following a lot as a custom view type. But this leads to HUGE inflation times. I meassured 500 ms and more. This is of course unaccaptable.</p>\n<p>What can I do to improve the layout performance.
