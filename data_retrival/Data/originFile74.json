To get `26` you would need `substring(8, 10)`. At this stage, it&#39;s hard to say whether or not the *days of the month* will always be in the format of two digits (as in `01`, `02`, `30`, etc) or will it possibly be in the format of single digits as well (as in `1`, `2`, `30`, etc). \r\n\r\nIn the provided date (`&quot;Thu Oct 26 2023&quot;`), one thing that is for sure is the fact that, if the actual string date format is always followed, there will always be a white-space between the date components. Based on this fact, it would be more beneficial to split the date components to collect the actual *day of the month* regardless of how many digits it may be.\r\n \r\n    // `hireDate` is an instance variable within the `MyObject` class:\r\n    // `list` is a List of MyObject instances, ex: List&lt;MyObject&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    list.sort(java.util.Comparator.comparing(e -&gt; e.hireDate.split(&quot;\\\\s&quot;)[2]));\r\n\r\nThis however will not sort properly. Consider the fact that the date is a string and string represented integer numbers such as the *day of month* and the *year* do not sort the same as actual Integer (int or long type) numbers, for example, to sort string values of: &quot;10&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, and &quot;5&quot;, you would think that the sorted result would be: `&quot;1&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;10&quot;` but...it won&#39;t be. It will be sorted as `&quot;1&quot;, &quot;10&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;5&quot;`. If the above values were actual int or long type integer values: `10, 3, 1, and 5` then these numbers would indeed be sorted in ascending order as `1, 3, 5, 10` as expected.\r\n\r\nTo get around this little problem we can convert the String represented integer values to BigInteger which accepts string values and will allow the sort to be carried out properly:\r\n\r\n    // `hireDate` is an instance variable within the `MyObject` class:\r\n    // `list` is a List of MyObject instances, ex: List&lt;MyObject&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    list.sort(java.util.Comparator.comparing(e -&gt; \r\n                new java.math.BigInteger(e.hireDate.split(&quot;\\\\s&quot;)[2])));\r\n\r\nwould result in a sorted list of: `&quot;1&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;10&quot;`. \r\n\r\nTo see the above code in action, create a new project and create a SortByDay class with a `main()` method and copy paste the following runnable code into it. Be sure to read the comments in code:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class SortByDay {\r\n    \r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        /* App started this way to avoid the need for statics\r\n           unless we really want them:        */\r\n        new SortByDay().startApp(args);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    private void startApp(String[] args) {\r\n        // Create a java.util.List of MyObject instances:\r\n        java.util.List&lt;MyObject&gt; objList = new java.util.ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n        objList.add(new MyObject(&quot;Tom Jones&quot;, 66, &quot;Thu Oct 4 2023&quot;, 32.50));\r\n        objList.add(new MyObject(&quot;Tracey Johnson&quot;, 59, &quot;Tue Oct 10 2023&quot;, 31.00));\r\n        objList.add(new MyObject(&quot;Dave Simpson&quot;, 30, &quot;Wed Oct 1 2023&quot;, 43.75));\r\n        \r\n        /* Display the List before sorting in Ascending order\r\n           by day of month:            */\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Before Sorting:\\n===============&quot;);\r\n        for (MyObject o : objList) {\r\n            System.out.println(o.toString());\r\n        }\r\n        System.out.println();\r\n        \r\n        /* Sort the List of MyObject based on the day of month \r\n           in each instance contained within the List:     */\r\n        sortListedObjectByDayOfMonth(objList);\r\n        \r\n        /* Display the List after sorting in Ascending order\r\n           by day of month:            */\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;After Sorting:\\n==============&quot;);\r\n        for (MyObject o : objList) {\r\n            System.out.println(o.toString());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public void sortListedObjectByDayOfMonth(java.util.List&lt;MyObject&gt; list) {\r\n        list.sort(java.util.Comparator.comparing(e -&gt; \r\n                new java.math.BigInteger(e.hireDate.split(&quot;\\\\s&quot;)[2])));\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class MyObject {\r\n        \r\n        // Instance (member) variables:\r\n        private String name;\r\n        private int age;\r\n        private String hireDate;\r\n        private double wage;\r\n\r\n        // Constructor:\r\n        public MyObject(String name, int age, String hireDate, double wage) {\r\n            this.name = name;\r\n            this.age = age;\r\n            this.hireDate = hireDate;\r\n            this.wage = wage;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        @Override\r\n        public String toString() {\r\n            return name + &quot;, &quot; + age + &quot;, \\&quot;&quot; + hireDate + &quot;\\&quot;, $&quot; \r\n                                + String.format(&quot;%.02f&quot;, wage);\r\n        }\r\n    }    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsole Window output should look something like this when the code is run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBefore Sorting:\r\n===============\r\nTom Jones, 66, &quot;Thu Oct 4 2023&quot;, $32.50\r\nTracey Johnson, 59, &quot;Tue Oct 10 2023&quot;, $31.00\r\nDave Simpson, 30, &quot;Wed Oct 1 2023&quot;, $43.75\r\n\r\nAfter Sorting:\r\n==============\r\nDave Simpson, 30, &quot;Wed Oct 1 2023&quot;, $43.75\r\nTom Jones, 66, &quot;Thu Oct 4 2023&quot;, $32.50\r\nTracey Johnson, 59, &quot;Tue Oct 10 2023&quot;, $31.00\r\n```","title":"Sorting a list of objects by an attribute&#39;s substring","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>I want to sort those objects by their substring(8,9) which is 26 in\nthis case.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><code>substring(8, 9)</code> will not provide 26 from <code>&quot;Thu Oct 26 2023&quot;</code>, it will provide <strong><code>2</code></strong>.

(May 2022)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n*Original Answer*\r\n\r\nJust started using Lombok today.  So far I like it, but one drawback I didn&#39;t see mentioned was refactoring support.\r\n\r\nIf you have a class annotated with `@Data`, it will generate the getters and setters for you based on the field names.  If you use one of those getters in another class, then decide the field is poorly named, it will not find usages of those getters and setters and replace the old name with the new name.  \r\n\r\nI would imagine this would have to be done via an IDE plug-in and not via Lombok.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE (Jan 22 &#39;13)**  \r\nAfter using Lombok for 3 months, I still recommend it for most projects.  I did, however, find another drawback that is similar to the one listed above.\r\n\r\nIf you have a class, say `MyCompoundObject.java` that has 2 members, both annotated with `@Delegate`, say `myWidgets` and `myGadgets`, when you call `myCompoundObject.getThingies()` from another class, it&#39;s impossible to know if it&#39;s delegating to the `Widget` or `Gadget` because you can no longer jump to source within the IDE.  \r\n\r\nUsing the Eclipse &quot;Generate Delegate Methods...&quot; provides you with the same functionality, is just as quick and provides source jumping.  The downside is it clutters your source with boilerplate code that take the focus off the important stuff.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 2 (Feb 26 &#39;13)**  \r\nAfter 5 months, we&#39;re still using Lombok, but I have some other annoyances.  The lack of a declared getter &amp; setter can get annoying at times when you are trying to familiarize yourself with new code.  \r\n\r\nFor example, if I see a method called `getDynamicCols()` but I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s about, I have some extra hurdles to jump to determine the purpose of this method. Some of the hurdles are Lombok, some are the lack of a Lombok smart plugin.  Hurdles include: \r\n\r\n - Lack of JavaDocs. If I javadoc the field, I would hope the getter and setter would inherit that javadoc through the Lombok compilation step.\r\n - Jump to method definition jumps me to the class, but not the property that generated the getter. This is a plugin issue.\r\n - Obviously you are not able to set a breakpoint in a getter/setter unless you generate or code the method.\r\n - NOTE: This Reference Search is not an issue as I first thought it was.  You do need to be using a perspective that enables the Outline view though. Not a problem for most developers. My problem was I am using Mylyn which was filtering my `Outline` view, so I didn&#39;t see the methods.  _Lack of References search.  If I want to see who&#39;s calling `getDynamicCols(args...)`, I have to generate or code the setter to be able to search for references._ \r\n\r\n**UPDATE 3 (Mar 7 &#39;13)**  \r\nLearning to use the various ways of doing things in Eclipse I guess.  You can actually set a conditional breakpoint (BP) on a Lombok generated method.  Using the `Outline` view, you can right-click the method to `Toggle Method Breakpoint`.  Then when you hit the BP, you can use the debugging `Variables` view to see what the generated method named the parameters (usually the same as the field name) and finally, use the `Breakpoints` view to right-click the BP and select `Breakpoint Properties...` to add a condition.  Nice.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 4 (Aug 16 &#39;13)**  \r\nNetbeans doesn&#39;t like it when you update your Lombok dependencies in your Maven pom.  The project still compiles, but files get flagged for having compilation errors because it can&#39;t see the methods Lombok is creating.  Clearing the Netbeans cache resolves the issue.  Not sure if there is a &quot;Clean Project&quot; option like there is in Eclipse.  Minor issue, but wanted to make it known.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 5 (Jan 17 &#39;14)**  \r\nLombok doesn&#39;t always play nice with Groovy, or at least the `groovy-eclipse-compiler`.  You might have to downgrade your version of the compiler.\r\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8524891/maven-groovy-and-java-lombok][1]\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 6 (Jun 26 &#39;14)**  \r\nA word of warning. Lombok is slightly addictive and if you work on a project where you can&#39;t use it for some reason, it will annoy the piss out of you.  You may be better off just never using it at all.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 7 (Jul 23 &#39;14)**  \r\nThis is a bit of an interesting update because it directly addresses the _safety_ of adopting Lombok that the OP asked about.\r\n\r\nAs of v1.14, the `@Delegate` annotation has been demoted to an Experimental status. The details are documented on their site ([Lombok Delegate Docs][2]).\r\n\r\nThe thing is, if you were using this feature, your backout options are limited.  I see the options as:\r\n\r\n - Manually remove `@Delegate` annotations and generate/handcode the delegate code. This is a little harder if you were using attributes within the annotation.\r\n - Delombok the files that have the `@Delegate` annotation and maybe add back in the annotations that you do want.\r\n - Never update Lombok or maintain a fork (or live with using experiential features).\r\n - Delombok your entire project and stop using Lombok.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, [Delombok doesn&#39;t have an option to remove a subset of annotations][3]; it&#39;s all or nothing at least for the context of a single file. I opened [a ticket to request this feature][4] with Delombok flags, but I wouldn&#39;t expect that in the near future.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 8 (Oct 20 &#39;14)**  \r\nIf it&#39;s an option for you, Groovy offers most of the same benefits of Lombok, plus a boat load of other features, including [@Delegate][5].  If you think you&#39;ll have a hard time selling the idea to the powers that be, take a look at the `@CompileStatic` or `@TypeChecked` annotation to see if that can help your cause.  In fact, [the primary focus of the Groovy 2.0 release was static safety][6].\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 9 (Sep 1 &#39;15)**  \r\nLombok is still being [actively maintained and enhanced][7], which bodes well to the safety level of adoption.  The [@Builder][8] annotations is one of my favorite new features.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 10 (Nov 17 &#39;15)**  \r\nThis may not seem directly related to the OP&#39;s question, but worth sharing.  If you&#39;re looking for tools to help you reduce the amount of boilerplate code you write, you can also check out [Google Auto][9] - in particular [AutoValue][10].  If you look at their [slide deck][11], the list Lombok as a possible solution to the problem they are trying to solve. The cons they list for Lombok are:\r\n\r\n - The inserted code is invisible (you can&#39;t &quot;see&quot; the the methods it generates) [ed note - actually you can, but it just requires a decompiler]\r\n - The compiler hacks are non-standard and fragile\r\n - &quot;In our view, your code is no longer really Java&quot;\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure how much I agree with their evaluation.  And given the cons of AutoValue that are documented in the slides, I&#39;ll be sticking with Lombok (if Groovy is not an option).\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 11 (Feb 8 &#39;16)**  \r\nI found out [Spring Roo][12] has some [similar annotations][13]. I was a little surprised to find out Roo is still a thing and finding documentation for the annotations is a bit rough.  Removal also doesn&#39;t look as easy as de-lombok.  Lombok seems like the safer choice. \r\n\r\n**UPDATE 12 (Feb 17 &#39;16)**  \r\nWhile trying to come up with justifications for why it&#39;s safe to bring in Lombok for the project I&#39;m currently working on, I found a piece of gold that was added with `v1.14` - The [Configuration System][14]!  This is means you can configure a project to dis-allow certain features that your team deems unsafe or undesirable.  Better yet, it can also create directory specific config with different settings.  This is AWESOME.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 13 (Oct 4 &#39;16)**  \r\nIf this kind of thing matters to you, [Oliver Gierke][15] felt it was safe to [add Lombok to Spring Data Rest][16].\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 14 (Sep 26 &#39;17)**  \r\nAs pointed out by [@gavenkoa][17] in the comments on the OPs question, [JDK9 compiler support isn&#39;t yet available][18] (Issue #985). It also sounds like it&#39;s not going to be an easy fix for the Lombok team to get around.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 15 (Mar 26 &#39;18)**  \r\nThe Lombok changelog indicates as of v1.16.20 &quot;[Compiling lombok on JDK1.9 is now possible][19]&quot; even though [#985][18] is still open.\r\n\r\nChanges to accommodate JDK9, however, necessitated some breaking changes; all isolated to changes in config defaults.  It&#39;s a little concerning that they introduced breaking changes, but the version only bumped the &quot;Incremental&quot; version number (going from v1.16.18 to v1.16.20). Since this post was about the safety, if you had a `yarn/npm` like build system that automatically upgraded to the latest incremental version, you might be in for a rude awakening.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 16 (Jan 9 &#39;19)**  \r\n\r\nIt seems [the JDK9 issues have been resolved][19] and Lombok works with JDK10, and even JDK11 as far as I can tell. \r\n\r\nOne thing I noticed though that was concerning from a safety aspect is the fact that the change log going from v1.18.2 to v1.18.4 lists two items as `BREAKING CHANGE`!?  I&#39;m not sure how a breaking change happens in a semver &quot;patch&quot; update. Could be an issue if you use a tool that auto-updates patch versions. \r\n\r\n**UPDATE 17 (Mar 17 &#39;21)**  \r\n\r\nThere is some drama unfolding between the Lombok developers and an OpenJDK developer around JDK 16.  [The JDK developers argue][20] that Lombok is taking advantage of unpublished JDK internals via loopholes the JDK team would like to close, but have intentionally left open for various reasons. \r\n\r\n[They have stated their concern][21] (about the safety of Lombok) as such:\r\n\r\n&gt; All access to internals will remain available as before, provided that\r\n&gt; the client application explicitly allows it, acknowledging that it is\r\n&gt; knowingly taking on any maintenance (or security) issue this might\r\n&gt; entail.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; While Lombok might think they&#39;re deceiving OpenJDK, all they&#39;re doing\r\n&gt; is announcing that it is their intention to deceive their own users.\r\n\r\nThere may come a day soon where Lombok will not be able to find any more creative solutions around the JDK&#39;s security restrictions.  Even if they do, the safety of using Lombok in your project may be in question.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 18 (May 11 &#39;22)** \r\n\r\nA recent comment asked for a summary, so I put that at the top.\r\n\r\nThe short answer is it&#39;s perfectly safe to use and I&#39;d highly recommend using it if we&#39;re writing Java code.\r\n\r\nGiven that support for JDK 17 has been out for awhile and was released less than a month after the JDK was officially released, the safety of Lombok sticking around is high.  And you can always de-lombok if you need to.\r\n\r\nAs a consultant, I get to see how a lot of different companies write code.  Every client I&#39;ve had for the past 5 years has used Lombok. These have all been Fortune 1000 companies. It speeds development and makes it less error prone. \r\n\r\nThat said, you still need to keep up on the latest features of the JDK. Consider using the Java `record` keyword to make your objects immutable instead of some Lombok feature.  Use Lombok where it makes sense.  Use the Lombok config options to prevent usage of it in ways you don&#39;t agree with.\r\n\r\nSo unless something major happens, this will probably be my last update to this answer.  Thanks for all the votes. I&#39;m glad it helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8524891/maven-groovy-and-java-lombok\r\n  [2]: http://projectlombok.org/features/experimental/Delegate.html &quot;Delegate Docs&quot;\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/blob/master/src/delombok/lombok/delombok/Delombok.java\r\n  [4]: https://code.google.com/p/projectlombok/issues/detail?id=711\r\n  [5]: http://groovy.codehaus.org/Delegate+transformation\r\n  [6]: http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/Groovy+2.0+release+notes#Groovy2.0releasenotes-A%E2%80%9Cstatictheme%E2%80%9Dforadynamiclanguage\r\n  [7]: https://projectlombok.org/changelog.html\r\n  [8]: https://projectlombok.org/features/Builder.html\r\n  [9]: https://github.com/google/auto\r\n  [10]: https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value\r\n  [11]: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14u_h-lMn7f1rXE1nDiLX0azS3IkgjGl5uxp5jGJ75RE/edit#slide=id.g2a5e9c4a8_0104\r\n  [12]: http://projects.spring.io/spring-roo/\r\n  [13]: https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=RooEquals\r\n  [14]: https://projectlombok.org/features/configuration.html\r\n  [15]: https://stackoverflow.com/users/18122/oliver-gierke\r\n  [16]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-rest/blame/897bc88d6922e755038a6a8e34ca25ace6a27689/spring-data-rest-webmvc/src/main/java/org/springframework/data/rest/webmvc/alps/RootResourceInformationToAlpsDescriptorConverter.java#L20\r\n  [17]: https://stackoverflow.com/users/173149/gavenkoa\r\n  [18]: https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/985\r\n  [19]: https://projectlombok.org/changelog\r\n  [20]: https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/2681#issuecomment-791452056\r\n  [21]: https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/m66r8w/is_lombok_in_danger_of_becoming_incompatible_with/gr49s1h?utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3","title":"Is it safe to use Project Lombok?","body":"<p><strong>TL; DR:</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, it's pretty safe to use and I'd recommend using it.

Not sure if there is a &quot;Clean Project&quot; option like there is in Eclipse.  Minor issue, but wanted to make it known.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 5 (Jan 17 '14)</strong><br />\nLombok doesn't always play nice with Groovy, or at least the <code>groovy-eclipse-compiler</code>.  You might have to downgrade your version of the compiler.\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8524891/maven-groovy-and-java-lombok\">Maven Groovy and Java + Lombok</a></p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 6 (Jun 26 '14)</strong><br />\nA word of warning. Lombok is slightly addictive and if you work on a project where you can't use it for some reason, it will annoy the piss out of you.  You may be better off just never using it at all.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 7 (Jul 23 '14)</strong><br />\nThis is a bit of an interesting update because it directly addresses the <em>safety</em> of adopting Lombok that the OP asked about.</p>\n<p>As of v1.14, the <code>@Delegate</code> annotation has been demoted to an Experimental status. The details are documented on their site (<a href=\"http://projectlombok.org/features/experimental/Delegate.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\" title=\"Delegate Docs\">Lombok Delegate Docs</a>).</p>\n<p>The thing is, if you were using this feature, your backout options are limited.  I see the options as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manually remove <code>@Delegate</code> annotations and generate/handcode the delegate code. This is a little harder if you were using attributes within the annotation.</li>\n<li>Delombok the files that have the <code>@Delegate</code> annotation and maybe add back in the annotations that you do want.</li>\n<li>Never update Lombok or maintain a fork (or live with using experiential features).</li>\n<li>Delombok your entire project and stop using Lombok.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As far as I can tell, <a href=\"https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/blob/master/src/delombok/lombok/delombok/Delombok.java\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Delombok doesn't have an option to remove a subset of annotations</a>; it's all or nothing at least for the context of a single file. I opened <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/projectlombok/issues/detail?id=711\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a ticket to request this feature</a> with Delombok flags, but I wouldn't expect that in the near future.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 8 (Oct 20 '14)</strong><br />\nIf it's an option for you, Groovy offers most of the same benefits of Lombok, plus a boat load of other features, including <a href=\"http://groovy.codehaus.org/Delegate+transformation\" rel=\"noreferrer\">@Delegate</a>.  If you think you'll have a hard time selling the idea to the powers that be, take a look at the <code>@CompileStatic</code> or <code>@TypeChecked</code> annotation to see if that can help your cause.  In fact, <a href=\"http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/Groovy+2.0+release+notes#Groovy2.0releasenotes-A%E2%80%9Cstatictheme%E2%80%9Dforadynamiclanguage\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the primary focus of the Groovy 2.0 release was static safety</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 9 (Sep 1 '15)</strong><br />\nLombok is still being <a href=\"https://projectlombok.org/changelog.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">actively maintained and enhanced</a>, which bodes well to the safety level of adoption.  The <a href=\"https://projectlombok.org/features/Builder.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">@Builder</a> annotations is one of my favorite new features.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 10 (Nov 17 '15)</strong><br />\nThis may not seem directly related to the OP's question, but worth sharing.  If you're looking for tools to help you reduce the amount of boilerplate code you write, you can also check out <a href=\"https://github.com/google/auto\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Google Auto</a> - in particular <a href=\"https://github.com/google/auto/tree/master/value\" rel=\"noreferrer\">AutoValue</a>.  If you look at their <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14u_h-lMn7f1rXE1nDiLX0azS3IkgjGl5uxp5jGJ75RE/edit#slide=id.g2a5e9c4a8_0104\" rel=\"noreferrer\">slide deck</a>, the list Lombok as a possible solution to the problem they are trying to solve. The cons they list for Lombok are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The inserted code is invisible (you can't &quot;see&quot; the the methods it generates) [ed note - actually you can, but it just requires a decompiler]</li>\n<li>The compiler hacks are non-standard and fragile</li>\n<li>&quot;In our view, your code is no longer really Java&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm not sure how much I agree with their evaluation.  And given the cons of AutoValue that are documented in the slides, I'll be sticking with Lombok (if Groovy is not an option).</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 11 (Feb 8 '16)</strong><br />\nI found out <a href=\"http://projects.spring.io/spring-roo/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Spring Roo</a> has some <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=RooEquals\">similar annotations</a>. I was a little surprised to find out Roo is still a thing and finding documentation for the annotations is a bit rough.  Removal also doesn't look as easy as de-lombok.  Lombok seems like the safer choice.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 12 (Feb 17 '16)</strong><br />\nWhile trying to come up with justifications for why it's safe to bring in Lombok for the project I'm currently working on, I found a piece of gold that was added with <code>v1.14</code> - The <a href=\"https://projectlombok.org/features/configuration.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Configuration System</a>!  This is means you can configure a project to dis-allow certain features that your team deems unsafe or undesirable.  Better yet, it can also create directory specific config with different settings.  This is AWESOME.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 13 (Oct 4 '16)</strong><br />\nIf this kind of thing matters to you, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/18122/oliver-gierke\">Oliver Gierke</a> felt it was safe to <a href=\"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-rest/blame/897bc88d6922e755038a6a8e34ca25ace6a27689/spring-data-rest-webmvc/src/main/java/org/springframework/data/rest/webmvc/alps/RootResourceInformationToAlpsDescriptorConverter.java#L20\" rel=\"noreferrer\">add Lombok to Spring Data Rest</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 14 (Sep 26 '17)</strong><br />\nAs pointed out by <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/173149/gavenkoa\">@gavenkoa</a> in the comments on the OPs question, <a href=\"https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/985\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JDK9 compiler support isn't yet available</a> (Issue #985). It also sounds like it's not going to be an easy fix for the Lombok team to get around.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 15 (Mar 26 '18)</strong><br />\nThe Lombok changelog indicates as of v1.16.20 &quot;<a href=\"https://projectlombok.org/changelog\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Compiling lombok on JDK1.9 is now possible</a>&quot; even though <a href=\"https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/985\" rel=\"noreferrer\">#985</a> is still open.</p>\n<p>Changes to accommodate JDK9, however, necessitated some breaking changes; all isolated to changes in config defaults.  It's a little concerning that they introduced breaking changes, but the version only bumped the &quot;Incremental&quot; version number (going from v1.16.18 to v1.16.20). Since this post was about the safety, if you had a <code>yarn/npm</code> like build system that automatically upgraded to the latest incremental version, you might be in for a rude awakening.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 16 (Jan 9 '19)</strong></p>\n<p>It seems <a href=\"https://projectlombok.org/changelog\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the JDK9 issues have been resolved</a> and Lombok works with JDK10, and even JDK11 as far as I can tell.</p>\n<p>One thing I noticed though that was concerning from a safety aspect is the fact that the change log going from v1.18.2 to v1.18.4 lists two items as <code>BREAKING CHANGE</code>!?  I'm not sure how a breaking change happens in a semver &quot;patch&quot; update. Could be an issue if you use a tool that auto-updates patch versions.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 17 (Mar 17 '21)</strong></p>\n<p>There is some drama unfolding between the Lombok developers and an OpenJDK developer around JDK 16.  <a href=\"https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok/issues/2681#issuecomment-791452056\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The JDK developers argue</a> that Lombok is taking advantage of unpublished JDK internals via loopholes the JDK team would like to close, but have intentionally left open for various reasons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/m66r8w/is_lombok_in_danger_of_becoming_incompatible_with/gr49s1h?utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">They have stated their concern</a> (about the safety of Lombok) as such:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All access to internals will remain available as before, provided that\nthe client application explicitly allows it, acknowledging that it is\nknowingly taking on any maintenance (or security) issue this might\nentail.</p>\n<p>While Lombok might think they're deceiving OpenJDK, all they're doing\nis announcing that it is their intention to deceive their own users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There may come a day soon where Lombok will not be able to find any more creative solutions around the JDK's security restrictions.  Even if they do, the safety of using Lombok in your project may be in question.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 18 (May 11 '22)</strong></p>\n<p>A recent comment asked for a summary, so I put that at the top.</p>\n<p>The short answer is it's perfectly safe to use and I'd highly recommend using it if we're writing Java code.</p>\n<p>Given that support for JDK 17 has been out for awhile and was released less than a month after the JDK was officially released, the safety of Lombok sticking around is high.  And you can always de-lombok if you need to.</p>\n<p>As a consultant, I get to see how a lot of different companies write code.  Every client I've had for the past 5 years has used Lombok. These have all been Fortune 1000 companies. It speeds development and makes it less error prone.</p>\n<p>That said, you still need to keep up on the latest features of the JDK. Consider using the Java <code>record</code> keyword to make your objects immutable instead of some Lombok feature.  Use Lombok where it makes sense.  Use the Lombok config options to prevent usage of it in ways you don't agree with.</p>\n<p>So unless something major happens, this will probably be my last update to this answer.  Thanks for all the votes. I'm glad it helps.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1988170,"reputation":2527,"user_id":1782868,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"sorencito"},"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":17,"is_accepted":false,"score":15,"last_activity_date":1376680807,"creation_date":1376680807,"answer_id":18280625,"question_id":3852091,"body_markdown":"I know I&#39;m late, but I can&#39;t resist the temptation: anybody liking Lombok should also have a look at Scala.

Even working good in most part of the time, you are always a hostage from this plugins to be maintained in the future releases of the IDEs and [even the language version][1] (Java 10+ will accelerate the development of the language). For example, I tried to update from Intellij IDEA 2017.3 to 2018.1 and I couldn&#39;t do that because there was some problem on the actual lombok plugin version and I needed to wait the plugin be updated... This also is a problem if you would like to use a more alternative IDE that don&#39;t have any Lombok plugin support.\r\n - **&#39;Find usages&#39; problem.**. Using Lombok you don&#39;t see the generated getter, setter, constructor, builder methods and etc. So, if you are planning to find out where these methods are being used in your project by your IDE, you can&#39;t do this only looking for the class that owns this hidden methods.\r\n - **So easy that the developers don&#39;t care to break the encapsulation**. I know that it&#39;s not really a problem from Lombok. But I saw a bigger tendency from the developers to not control anymore what methods needs to be visible or not. So, many times they are just copying and pasting `@Getter @Setter @Builder @AllArgsConstructor @NoArgsConstructor` annotations block without thinking what methods the class really need to be exposed.\r\n - **Builder Obssession** &#169;. I invented this name (get off, Martin Fowler). Jokes apart, a Builder is so easy to create that even when a class have only two parameters the developers prefer to use `@Builder` instead of constructor or a static constructor method. Sometimes they even try to create a Builder inside the lombok Builder, creating weird situations like `MyClass.builder().name(&quot;Name&quot;).build().create()`.\r\n - **Barriers when refactoring**. If you are using, for example, a `@AllArgsConstructor` and need to add one more parameter on the constructor, the IDE can&#39;t help you to add this extra parameter in all places (mostly, tests) that are instantiating the class.\r\n - **Mixing Lombok with concrete methods**. You can&#39;t use Lombok in all scenarios to create a getter/setter/etc. So, you will see these two approaches mixed in your code. You get used to this after some time, but feels like a hack on the language.\r\n\r\nLike another answer said, if you are angry about the Java verbosity and use Lombok to deal with it, try Kotlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/53866929/2387977","title":"Is it safe to use Project Lombok?","body":"<p>I read some opinions about the Lombok and actually I'm using it in some projects.</p>\n\n<p>Well, in the first contact with Lombok I had a bad impression.

So, my final impression about Lombok is not so positive.</p>\n\n<p>My reasons to think in this way:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>IDE plugin dependency</strong>. The IDE support for Lombok is through plugins. Even working good in most part of the time, you are always a hostage from this plugins to be maintained in the future releases of the IDEs and <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/53866929/2387977\">even the language version</a> (Java 10+ will accelerate the development of the language).

And it maps neatly with a debugging technique that I was taught .... umm ... 40 years ago.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nFirst I draw your attention to this:\r\n\r\n      System.out.println(&quot;Is your car an import?&quot;);\r\n      while (true)\r\n      {\r\n         answer = keyboard.nextLine();\r\n         if (answer.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;yes&quot;)) \r\n       {\r\n         yn = true;\r\n         break;\r\n       } \r\n            else if (answer.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;no&quot;))\r\n            {\r\n               yn = false;\r\n               break;\r\n             } \r\n               else \r\n               {\r\n               System.out.println(&quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t catch that. Please answer yes or no&quot;);\r\n               }\r\n    \r\n       } \r\n\r\nThat code does a pretty good job of asking a &quot;yes or no&quot; question and getting the answer.  It includes code to retry if the user responds with something that isn&#39;t recognizable as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.\r\n\r\nSo I&#39;m guessing that someone wrote that code for you ... or you found it somewhere.  You need to read that code carefully, and make sure you understand exactly how it works.\r\n\r\n-------------------- \r\n\r\nNext, I draw your attention to this:\r\n\r\n      for(int i=0; i&lt;services.length; i++)\r\n         {\r\n           System.out.println(&quot;Do you want a &quot; +services[i]);\r\n           answer = keyboard.next();    \r\n          }  \r\n\r\nThis code does not make sense.  (Explain it to your rubber duck!)\r\n\r\nYour earlier code is a good example of how to ask a yes / no question.  But this is nothing like that:\r\n\r\n  - You are not testing for &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.\r\n  - You are not repeating if the user gives an unrecognizable answer\r\n  - You are not even storing the answer .... for each distinct service.\r\n\r\nThen this:\r\n\r\n     double amount = 0;\r\n     double[] price = {39.99, 59.99, 119.99, 109.99};  \r\n     for(int i =0; i&lt;price.length; i++)\r\n           {\r\n              amount = (price[i] + price [i]);\r\n           }\r\n\r\nIt looks like this is trying to add the price of service items to the overall amount.  But:\r\n\r\n  - You are doing it for *every* service item, not just the items that the customer asked for.\r\n  - You are actually doing the calculation incorrectly anyway.  (Talk to your Rubber Duck about it!)\r\n\r\nHow to fix this?\r\n\r\n  - Some things should be obvious from what I said above.\r\n  - The problem of remembering the answers from the first `for` loop and using them in the second `for` loop ... is actually a problem you can / should avoid.  Instead, combine the two loops into one.  Here&#39;s some pseudo code:\r\n\r\n            for each service:\r\n                ask the user if he wants this service\r\n                if the user wants this service:\r\n                    add the service cost to the total.\r\n\r\n     Understand the *logic* of that, and translate it into Java code.  (Yes I could write it for you, but that defeats the purpose!)           \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://rubberduckdebugging.com/\r\n\r\n","title":"How Do I Add Charges Based On Yes or No?","body":"<p>Before I talk about your code, I recommend you read this article.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://rubberduckdebugging.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rubber Duck Debugging</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is a bit flippant, but there is a deep truth to it.

It includes code to retry if the user responds with something that isn't recognizable as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.</p>\n<p>So I'm guessing that someone wrote that code for you ... or you found it somewhere.  You need to read that code carefully, and make sure you understand exactly how it works.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Next, I draw your attention to this:</p>\n<pre><code>  for(int i=0; i&lt;services.length; i++)\n     {\n       System.out.println(&quot;Do you want a &quot; +services[i]);\n       answer = keyboard.next();    \n      }  \n</code></pre>\n<p>This code does not make sense.  (Explain it to your rubber duck!)</p>\n<p>Your earlier code is a good example of how to ask a yes / no question.  But this is nothing like that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are not testing for &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.</li>\n<li>You are not repeating if the user gives an unrecognizable answer</li>\n<li>You are not even storing the answer .... for each distinct service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then this:</p>\n<pre><code> double amount = 0;\n double[] price = {39.99, 59.99, 119.99, 109.99};  \n for(int i =0; i&lt;price.length; i++)\n       {\n          amount = (price[i] + price [i]);\n       }\n</code></pre>\n<p>It looks like this is trying to add the price of service items to the overall amount.  But:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are doing it for <em>every</em> service item, not just the items that the customer asked for.</li>\n<li>You are actually doing the calculation incorrectly anyway.  (Talk to your Rubber Duck about it!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How to fix this?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Some things should be obvious from what I said above.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The problem of remembering the answers from the first <code>for</code> loop and using them in the second <code>for</code> loop ... is actually a problem you can / should avoid.  Instead, combine the two loops into one.  Here's some pseudo code:</p>\n<pre><code>    for each service:\n        ask the user if he wants this service\n        if the user wants this service:\n            add the service cost to the total.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Understand the <em>logic</em> of that, and translate it into Java code.  (Yes I could write it for you, but that defeats the purpose!)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":14355499,"reputation":33,"user_id":10369537,"display_name":"Ghetto Lisa"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":135,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":53330103,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1699421262,"creation_date":1542327697,"question_id":53329697,"body_markdown":"Working on a coding assignment and we have to incorporate methods and returning it.
