They are bound to a class and don&#39;t require an instance of the class in order to be invoked.\r\n\r\n`static` and `abstract` is an illegal combination of modifiers because static methods are completely self-contained and always have an implementation.\r\n\r\nYou can not inherit `static` methods and as subsequence the concept of **overriding** is not applicable to them. And since a *subclass* can not override a *parent&#39;s* `static` method, `abstract static` method doesn&#39;t make sense because it *can not be implemented*.\r\n\r\nA class method can be ***hidden*** by a method from a *subclass* with the same *signature*.\r\n\r\nA quote from [JLS](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.8.2):\r\n\r\n&gt; A class (static) method that is hidden can be **invoked by using a reference** whose type is the type of the class that actually **contains the declaration** of the method. In this respect, hiding of static methods is different from overriding of instance methods.\r\n\r\nI.e. ***hidden*** version can be invoked only on a *child* class or instance, conversely to the ***overridden*** method which can be invoked on the instance on of *parent* class or on the instance on of *child* class. \r\n\r\nIn other words, you can&#39;t obtain polymorphic behavior with `static` methods.\r\n___________________________________________\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\n&gt; I want to create several classes that must all implement both `computeMethodBody` and `sortSelectedMethods`\r\n\r\nSo you want these two `static` methods with the same signature to be present in a couple of classes. And that&#39;s totally fine. But you don&#39;t need a *parent* `abstract` class for that because there&#39;s no useful code in it if both its method will be hidden.\r\n\r\n&gt; creating documentation explaining how to create equivalent classes\r\n\r\nInheritance in **Object-Oriented Programming** isn&#39;t used for documentary purposes. The *child* should be capable to replace its *parent* in any use-cases, as Liskov substitution principle suggests.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that there are no use-cases for such a *parent* class. `combinedMethod` class isn&#39;t designed for inheritance (*BTW, it&#39;s not a very informative name and by convention names of classes and interfaces should start with a capital letter*).\r\n\r\nYou are misusing inheritance.

They are bound to a class and don't require an instance of the class in order to be invoked.</p>\n<p><code>static</code> and <code>abstract</code> is an illegal combination of modifiers because static methods are completely self-contained and always have an implementation.</p>\n<p>You can not inherit <code>static</code> methods and as subsequence the concept of <strong>overriding</strong> is not applicable to them. And since a <em>subclass</em> can not override a <em>parent's</em> <code>static</code> method, <code>abstract static</code> method doesn't make sense because it <em>can not be implemented</em>.</p>\n<p>A class method can be <em><strong>hidden</strong></em> by a method from a <em>subclass</em> with the same <em>signature</em>.</p>\n<p>A quote from <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.8.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JLS</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A class (static) method that is hidden can be <strong>invoked by using a reference</strong> whose type is the type of the class that actually <strong>contains the declaration</strong> of the method. In this respect, hiding of static methods is different from overriding of instance methods.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I.e. <em><strong>hidden</strong></em> version can be invoked only on a <em>child</em> class or instance, conversely to the <em><strong>overridden</strong></em> method which can be invoked on the instance on of <em>parent</em> class or on the instance on of <em>child</em> class.</p>\n<p>In other words, you can't obtain polymorphic behavior with <code>static</code> methods.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I want to create several classes that must all implement both <code>computeMethodBody</code> and <code>sortSelectedMethods</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So you want these two <code>static</code> methods with the same signature to be present in a couple of classes. And that's totally fine. But you don't need a <em>parent</em> <code>abstract</code> class for that because there's no useful code in it if both its method will be hidden.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>creating documentation explaining how to create equivalent classes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Inheritance in <strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong> isn't used for documentary purposes. The <em>child</em> should be capable to replace its <em>parent</em> in any use-cases, as Liskov substitution principle suggests.</p>\n<p>The problem is that there are no use-cases for such a <em>parent</em> class. <code>combinedMethod</code> class isn't designed for inheritance (<em>BTW, it's not a very informative name and by convention names of classes and interfaces should start with a capital letter</em>).</p>\n<p>You are misusing inheritance.

So, do this instead:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        return Search.session(entityManager)\r\n            .search(Tobacco.class)\r\n            .where(f -&gt; f.match()\r\n                .fields(&quot;barcode&quot;, &quot;name&quot;, &quot;manufacturer&quot;)\r\n                .matching(query)\r\n                .fuzzy()\r\n            )\r\n            .fetchHits(10);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, the actual answer:\r\n\r\n---- \r\n\r\n\r\n## Approaching this through the search query\r\n\r\n`.fuzzy()` isn&#39;t magic, it won&#39;t just match anything you think should match :) There&#39;s a [specific definition of what it does](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/search/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-dsl-predicate-match-fuzzy), and that&#39;s not what you want here.\r\n\r\nTo get the behavior you want, you could use this instead of your current predicate:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            .where(f -&gt; f.simpleQueryString()\r\n                .fields(&quot;barcode&quot;, &quot;name&quot;, &quot;manufacturer&quot;)\r\n                .matching(&quot;green*&quot;)\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou lose fuzziness, but you get the ability to perform [prefix queries](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/search/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-dsl-predicate-simple-query-string-prefix), which would give the results you want (`green*` would match `greenhouse`).\r\n\r\nHowever, the prefix queries are explicit: the user must add `*` after &quot;green&quot; in order to match &quot;all words that start with green&quot;.\r\n\r\nWhich leads us to...\r\n\r\n## Approaching this through analyzers\r\n\r\nIf you want this &quot;prefix matching&quot; behavior to be automatic, without the need to add `*` in the query, then what you need is a different analyzer.\r\n\r\nYour current analyzer breaks down indexed text using space as a separator (more or less; it&#39;s a bit more complex but that&#39;s the idea). But you apparently want it to break down &quot;greenhouse&quot; into &quot;green&quot; and &quot;house&quot;; that&#39;s the only way a query with the word &quot;green&quot; would match the word &quot;greenhouse&quot;.\r\n\r\nTo do that, you can use an analyzer similar to yours, but with an additional &quot;edge_ngram&quot; filter, to generate additional indexed tokens for every prefix string of your existing tokens.\r\n\r\nAdd another analyzer to your configurer:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Component(&quot;luceneTobaccoAnalysisConfigurer&quot;)\r\npublic class LuceneTobaccoAnalysisConfigurer implements LuceneAnalysisConfigurer {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void configure(LuceneAnalysisConfigurationContext context) {\r\n        context.analyzer(&quot;name&quot;).custom()\r\n            .tokenizer(&quot;standard&quot;)\r\n            .tokenFilter(&quot;lowercase&quot;)\r\n            .tokenFilter(&quot;asciiFolding&quot;);\r\n\r\n        // THIS PART IS NEW\r\n        context.analyzer(&quot;name_prefix&quot;).custom()\r\n            .tokenizer(&quot;standard&quot;)\r\n            .tokenFilter(&quot;lowercase&quot;)\r\n            .tokenFilter(&quot;asciiFolding&quot;)\r\n            .tokenFilter(&quot;edgeNGram&quot;)\r\n                    // Handling prefixes from 2 to 7 characters.\r\n                    // Prefixes of 1 character or more than 7 will\r\n                    // not be matched.\r\n                    // You can extend the range, but this will take more\r\n                    // space in the index for little gain.\r\n                    .param( &quot;minGramSize&quot;, &quot;2&quot; )\r\n                    .param( &quot;maxGramSize&quot;, &quot;7&quot; );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd change your mapping to use the `name` analyzer when querying, but the `name_prefix` analyzer when indexing:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Data\r\n@Entity\r\n@Indexed\r\n@NoArgsConstructor\r\n@AllArgsConstructor\r\n@Builder(toBuilder = true)\r\n@EqualsAndHashCode(of = &quot;id&quot;)\r\n@EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class)\r\npublic class Tobacco {\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue\r\n    private UUID id;\r\n    @NotBlank\r\n    @KeywordField\r\n    private String barcode;\r\n    @NotBlank\r\n    // CHANGE THIS\r\n    @FullTextField(analyzer = &quot;name_prefix&quot;, searchAnalyzer = &quot;name&quot;)\r\n    private String name;\r\n    @NotBlank\r\n    // CHANGE THIS\r\n    @FullTextField(analyzer = &quot;name_prefix&quot;, searchAnalyzer = &quot;name&quot;)\r\n    private String manufacturer;\r\n    @CreatedDate\r\n    private Instant createdAt;\r\n    @LastModifiedDate\r\n    private Instant updatedAt;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow [reindex your data](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/search/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-batchindex-massindexer).\r\n\r\nNow your query &quot;green&quot; will also match &quot;TobaCcO GreENhouse&quot;, because &quot;GreENhouse&quot; was indexed as `[&quot;greenhouse&quot;, &quot;gr&quot;, &quot;gre&quot;, &quot;gree&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;greenh&quot;, &quot;greenho&quot;]`.\r\n\r\n### Variations\r\n\r\n#### `edgeNGram` filter on distinct fields\r\n\r\nInstead of changing the analyzer of your current fields, you could *add* new fields for the same Java properties, but using the new analyzer with the `edgeNGram` filter:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Data\r\n@Entity\r\n@Indexed\r\n@NoArgsConstructor\r\n@AllArgsConstructor\r\n@Builder(toBuilder = true)\r\n@EqualsAndHashCode(of = &quot;id&quot;)\r\n@EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class)\r\npublic class Tobacco {\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue\r\n    private UUID id;\r\n    @NotBlank\r\n    @KeywordField\r\n    private String barcode;\r\n    @NotBlank\r\n    @FullTextField(analyzer = &quot;name&quot;)\r\n    // ADD THIS\r\n    @FullTextField(name = &quot;name_prefix&quot;, analyzer = &quot;name_prefix&quot;, searchAnalyzer = &quot;name&quot;)\r\n    private String name;\r\n    @NotBlank\r\n    @FullTextField(analyzer = &quot;name&quot;)\r\n    // ADD THIS\r\n    @FullTextField(name = &quot;manufacturer_prefix&quot;, analyzer = &quot;name_prefix&quot;, searchAnalyzer = &quot;name&quot;)\r\n    private String manufacturer;\r\n    @CreatedDate\r\n    private Instant createdAt;\r\n    @LastModifiedDate\r\n    private Instant updatedAt;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can target these fields as well as the normal ones in your query:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Component\r\n@AllArgsConstructor\r\npublic class IndexSearchTobaccoRepository {\r\n\r\n    private final EntityManager entityManager;\r\n\r\n    public List&lt;Tobacco&gt; find(String query) {\r\n        return Search.session(entityManager)\r\n            .search(Tobacco.class)\r\n            .where(f -&gt; f.match()\r\n                .fields(&quot;barcode&quot;, &quot;name&quot;, &quot;manufacturer&quot;).boost(2.0f)\r\n                .fields(&quot;name_prefix&quot;, &quot;manufacturer_prefix&quot;)\r\n                .matching(query)\r\n                .fuzzy()\r\n            )\r\n            .fetchHits(10);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I added a boost to the fields that don&#39;t use prefix. This is the main advantage of this variant over the one I explained higher up: matches on actual words (not prefixes) will be deemed more important, yielding a better score and thus pulling documents to the top of the result list if you use a [relevance sort](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/search/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-dsl-sort-score) (which is the default sort).\r\n\r\n#### Handling only compound words instead of all words\r\n\r\nI won&#39;t detail it here, but there&#39;s another approach if all you want is to handle compound words (&quot;greenhouse&quot; =&gt; &quot;green&quot; + &quot;house&quot;, &quot;superman&quot; =&gt; &quot;super&quot; + &quot;man&quot;, etc.). You can use the &quot;dictionaryCompoundWord&quot; filter. This is less powerful, but will generate less noise in your index (fewer meaningless tokens) and thus could lead to better [relevance sorts](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/search/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-dsl-sort-score).\r\nAnother downside is that you need to provide the filter with a dictionary that contains all words that could possibly be &quot;compounded&quot;.\r\nFor more information, see the source and javadoc of class `org.apache.lucene.analysis.compound.DictionaryCompoundWordTokenFilterFactory`, or the documentation of the [equivalent filter in Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-dict-decomp-tokenfilter.html).","title":"Hibernate search with lucene does not index similar names correctly","body":"<p>Before I answer your question, I'd like to point out that calling <code>.fetch(10).hits()</code> is suboptimal, especially when using the default sort (like you do):</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>        return Search.session(entityManager)\n            .search(Tobacco.class)\n            .where(f -&gt; f.match()\n                .fields(&quot;barcode&quot;, &quot;name&quot;, &quot;manufacturer&quot;)\n                .matching(query)\n                .fuzzy()\n            )\n            .fetch(10)\n            .hits();\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you call <code>.fetchHits(10)</code> directly, Lucene will be able to skip part of the search (the part where it counts the total hit count), and in large indexes this could lead to sizeable performance gains.

But you apparently want it to break down &quot;greenhouse&quot; into &quot;green&quot; and &quot;house&quot;; that's the only way a query with the word &quot;green&quot; would match the word &quot;greenhouse&quot;.</p>\n<p>To do that, you can use an analyzer similar to yours, but with an additional &quot;edge_ngram&quot;

This is the main advantage of this variant over the one I explained higher up: matches on actual words (not prefixes) will be deemed more important, yielding a better score and thus pulling documents to the top of the result list if you use a <a href=\"https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/search/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-dsl-sort-score\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">relevance sort</a> (which is the default sort).</p>\n<h4>Handling only compound words instead of all words</h4>\n<p>I won't detail it here, but there's another approach if all you want is to handle compound words (&quot;greenhouse&quot; =&gt; &quot;green&quot; + &quot;house&quot;, &quot;superman&quot; =&gt; &quot;super&quot; + &quot;man&quot;, etc.).

So I'm basically asking is that the correct behavior, or is there something I'm entirely missing to cause the zip FileSystem object to update the Zip file?</p>\n<p>Here's the code when I tried Dunc suggestion:\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {</p>\n<pre><code>    ZipFileSystem zipFS = new ZipFileSystem(&quot;C:\\\\Temp\\\\mylibrary\\\\build\\\\outputs\\\\jar\\\\temp\\\\mylibrary-debug.zip&quot;);\n    try (FileSystem fs = zipFS.zipFS) {\n        try (Stream&lt;Path&gt; paths = Files.find(zipFS.zipFS.getRootDirectories().\n                iterator().next().getRoot(), 10, (path, basicFileAttributes) -&gt; {\n            return !Files.isDirectory(path);\n        })) {\n            paths.forEach(path -&gt;\n                    System.out.println(&quot;zip contains entry: &quot; + path)\n            );\n        }\n\n        File file = new File(&quot;C:\\\\Temp\\\\mylibrary\\\\src\\\\main\\\\java\\\\com\\\\phinneyridge\\\\android\\\\myLib.java&quot;);\n        System.out.println(&quot;copying &quot; + file.getPath());\n        Path outPath = fs.getPath(&quot;myLib.java&quot;);\n        Files.copy(file.toPath(), outPath, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);\n\n        try (Stream&lt;Path&gt; paths = Files.find(zipFS.zipFS.getRootDirectories().\n                iterator().next().getRoot(), 10, (path, basicFileAttributes) -&gt; {\n            return !Files.isDirectory(path);\n        })) {\n            paths.forEach(path -&gt;\n                    System.out.println(&quot;zip contains entry: &quot; + path)\n            );\n        }\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        System.out.println(&quot;FileSystem Error: &quot; + e.getClass().getName() + &quot; - &quot; + e.getMessage());\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>}</p>\n<p>And by the way ZipFileSystem is a wrapper class around the FileSystem. I'll post that code too, incase that's where I 'm doing something wrong.</p>\n<pre><code>public class ZipFileSystem {\nFileSystem zipFS;\nPath zipFSPath;\n\n/**\n * Constructor for a ZipFile object\n * @param zipFilePath string representing the path to the zipfile.
