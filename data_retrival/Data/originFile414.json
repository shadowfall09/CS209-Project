I assume here that the decreasing sequences are to be *strictly* decreasing, so the `else` part should not be followed by a condition.\r\n* What you call *sorting* is actually *reversing*. It has the same result here, but the algorithm for revering has a better time complexity than for sorting.\r\n* The main issue you have raised: when a subarray is sorted, it affects the next, recursive execution of the function. \r\n* It is a pity that you have repetition of code just after the loop. Inside the loop you could look at `i+1` instead of `i-1` and detect the last index of a decreasing sequence.\r\n* It is a pity you have to scan the whole array again to find the next decreasing sequence.\r\n\r\nI would suggest this algorithm:\r\n\r\n1. Collect all decreasing sequences in one loop, but don&#39;t reverse anything yet. Just keep track of all the sequences\r\n2. Sort those sequences by their length\r\n3. Perform the reversals of these sequences.\r\n\r\nIn the first step you could even collect the sequences and use their length as an index in a list and register the starting index in a sublist at that index.

Could someone please tell how I can handle this correctly?</p>\n<pre><code>    public Mono&lt;String&gt; wrappingFunction(String param) {\n        return Mono.fromCallable(() -&gt; {\n\n            // do the blocking operation\n            return param;\n\n        }).subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic());\n    }\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["javascript","java","liferay-7"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":6799109,"reputation":151,"user_id":5233117,"display_name":"Peter Petrekanics"},"score":0,"creation_date":1668459086,"post_id":73700178,"comment_id":131405560,"body_markdown":"Could you please tell which exact version of Liferay 7 are you using?","body":"Could you please tell which exact version of Liferay 7 are you using?"},{"owner":{"account_id":20696487,"reputation":57,"user_id":15196570,"display_name":"Lincolnmyth"},"score":0,"creation_date":1668615252,"post_id":73700178,"comment_id":131449870,"body_markdown":"@PeterPetrekanics I am using liferay 7.3.5-ga6","body":"@PeterPetrekanics I am using liferay 7.3.5-ga6"}],"owner":{"account_id":20696487,"reputation":57,"user_id":15196570,"display_name":"Lincolnmyth"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":225,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1684918356,"creation_date":1663059496,"question_id":73700178,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to make a form that uploads an image to the document and media library in liferay.

How can I combat this problem now and in the future?</p>\n\n<p>Main method snippit</p>\n\n<pre><code>        String last;        \n        selector = in.nextInt();\n        if (selector == 1)\n        {\n           System.out.print(\"Please enter Last Name: \");\n           in.next();\n           last = in.nextLine();\n           entry.setLast(last);\n           terminator = true;\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Object naming method</p>\n\n<pre><code>   private static String last_name;\n   public static String setLast(String a)\n   {\n      last_name = a;\n      return last_name;\n   }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>this seems like a simple problem but I need some outside perspective! I do not think that im focusing on the true issue here. Thank you</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","iterator","java.util.scanner"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":11653484,"reputation":12724,"user_id":8534008,"display_name":"GBlodgett"},"score":0,"creation_date":1552019453,"post_id":27309800,"comment_id":96862358,"body_markdown":"Possible duplicate of [Scanner is skipping nextLine() after using next() or nextFoo()?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13102045/scanner-is-skipping-nextline-after-using-next-or-nextfoo)","body":"Possible duplicate of <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13102045/scanner-is-skipping-nextline-after-using-next-or-nextfoo\">Scanner is skipping nextLine() after using next() or nextFoo()?</a>"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1263831,"reputation":388998,"user_id":1221571,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"Eran"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1417759615,"creation_date":1417759615,"answer_id":27309822,"question_id":27309800,"body_markdown":"Add a `nextLine()` after `next()`, to consume the end of the line that contained the token you got by calling `next()`.

Your Iterator implementation has index as a point to the current element.\r\n\r\nWhat do you plan to store inside index? I see 2 possibilities:\r\na) it is giving you the current data location. The first element inside the array is element 0, so to be before that, I would initialize it as -1.\r\nb) It could be visual. So it is initialized as 0 first and then 1 means: first element, which would be the elementData[0].\r\n==&gt; It is just an internal variable so it is completely up to you, what you want to store inside of it.\r\n\r\nNow let us look at your hasNext method. If the sizer is 0, then there cannot be a next element. Ok. But then you check if iterator() is null? iterator always returns a new instance of your inner iterator class. So it will always be non null! So this seems wrong.\r\n\r\nYou have index and size. So you just have to check if the index is already pointing to the last element. So depending on the choice a/b above, you simply have to check if index+1 &lt; size or index&lt;size.\r\n\r\nAnd then the next function:\r\n - It has to validate that there is another element. (=&gt; hasNext)\r\n - you increase index\r\n - you return the element, index is pointing to (elementData[index] or elementData[index-1] (depends again on your decision what to store inside index)\r\n\r\nMy hint is, to play around with it with paper and pen.

Your Iterator implementation has index as a point to the current element.</p>\n\n<p>What do you plan to store inside index? I see 2 possibilities:\na) it is giving you the current data location. The first element inside the array is element 0, so to be before that, I would initialize it as -1.\nb) It could be visual. So it is initialized as 0 first and then 1 means: first element, which would be the elementData[0].\n==> It is just an internal variable so it is completely up to you, what you want to store inside of it.</p>\n\n<p>Now let us look at your hasNext method. If the sizer is 0, then there cannot be a next element. Ok. But then you check if iterator() is null? iterator always returns a new instance of your inner iterator class. So it will always be non null! So this seems wrong.</p>\n\n<p>You have index and size. So you just have to check if the index is already pointing to the last element. So depending on the choice a/b above, you simply have to check if index+1 &lt; size or index\n\n<p>And then the next function:\n - It has to validate that there is another element. (=> hasNext)\n - you increase index\n - you return the element, index is pointing to (elementData[index] or elementData[index-1] (depends again on your decision what to store inside index)</p>\n\n<p>My hint is, to play around with it with paper and pen. Just write an instance of your class with e.g. 3 elements (so elementData[0], elementData[1], elementData[2] hs some value, size = 3.

Rebuild the Jar from source\r\n\r\nUsing your IDE, move the classes out of the root/unnamed/default package into a proper named package, and build the jar again.\r\n\r\nSimply unzipping the jar and moving the class files around does not help - the class files have to be modified internally, which is what the tools below do.\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t have access to the sources, or if you don&#39;t want to mess with the source code - there are a couple of solutions I found inspired from [this][1] related discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2. Jar Jar Links tool\r\nhttps://github.com/shevek/jarjar\r\n\r\nIts old but still works. Get it from [here][2] as discussed [here][3]. \r\n\r\nThe way I used it\r\n```\r\n# View help\r\njava -jar &quot;bin/jarjar-command-1.0.3.jar&quot; --help\r\n\r\n# Run the command\r\njava -jar &quot;jarjar-command-1.0.3.jar&quot; --mode process --rules &quot;rules.txt&quot; target/my.jar --output target/my_new.jar\r\n\r\n# View contents of resulting jar\r\njar tf target/my_new.jar |less\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `rules.txt` to match root classes is `*`\r\n```\r\nrule * com.example.@1\r\n```\r\nso the rule moves them into the `com.example` package.

This happens only on specific calls of this method by the overlying method, not at all.</p>\n<p>So, the method I called in debugger was:</p>\n<pre><code>   @Override\n        public ServiceEntity getServiceById(int serviceId) {\n            List&lt;ServiceEntity&gt; list = em.createQuery(&quot;select s from ServiceEntity s where s.id = :id&quot;, ServiceEntity.class)\n                    .setParameter(&quot;id&quot;, serviceId)\n                    .getResultList();\n    \n            return (list.isEmpty() ? null : list.get(0));\n        }\n</code></pre>\n<p>and it is called from the</p>\n<pre><code> @Transactional(readOnly = true)\n    public ProviderService getProviderService(int serviceId) {\n        if (serviceProviderCache.get(serviceId) != null) {\n            return serviceProviderCache.get(serviceId);\n        }\n\n        ServiceEntity serviceEntity = pServiceDao.getServiceById(serviceId);\n        if (settingService.isEnableGateway() &amp;&amp; (Arrays.stream(GatewayProviderImpl.GATEWAY_PROVIDERS)\n                .anyMatch(p -&gt; serviceEntity.getProviderId().equals(p)))) {\n            serviceProviderCache.put(serviceId, providersCache.get(GatewayProviderImpl.PROVIDER_ID));\n        } else {\n            serviceProviderCache.put(serviceId, providersCache.get(serviceEntity.getProvider().getId()));\n        }\n\n        return serviceProviderCache.get(serviceId);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>where I do have the problem I have described.

Note, that in first method, the called <code>id=595</code> is the same as id that was passed as the parameter to the <code>@Transaction</code> marked method, while <code>id=594</code> isn't equal to that object.
