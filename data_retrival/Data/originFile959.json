In more detail, whenever I call the put method of the API my object gets updated inside the scope but its not persistent in the database.\n<br><br>\nSource code is hosted on gh: <a href=\"https://www.github.com/giorgosathanasopoulos/react-todo-backend\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">React-todo-backend</a>\n<br><br>\nI got a rest api put method that calls my service put method to update its members.\n<br>\n(Controller:put-&gt;Service:put-&gt;Entity.setVariables(variables))\n<br><br>\nWhat I tried:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding @Transactional annotation above my put method in my service class(used to work I'm not quite sure if new version of spring changed anything.)</li>\n<li>I thought of maybe deleting the entity and saving it as new in the database but my id is auto-generated and unique so I'm probably not gonna follow this approach since I don't want to alter the data myself(instead of the user).</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nThanks for your time and help in advance :) \n<br>\n(Its also my first time posting on stackoverflow so and I tried following the rules as much as possible but in case I missed anything please let me know and I'll try to fix it as soon as possible.)\n<br><br>\n<ul>\n<li>Windows 11, JDK 17, Spring 2.7.4, Mysql</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":["java","hadoop"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":9744042,"reputation":9944,"user_id":7224597,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"philantrovert"},"score":2,"creation_date":1515675466,"post_id":48206228,"comment_id":83396137,"body_markdown":"Make sure you have all dependencies defined correctly.

I have tried both the implementation of HttpClient3.1 &amp; 4; none of them have worked. Then I have downloaded the Source Code to see if there is anything I can dig up with.\r\n\r\nThese two classes deals with the HTTP implementation of JMeter:\r\n\r\n- org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.sampler.HTTPHC4Impl (for HttpClient4)\r\n- org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.sampler.HTTPHC3Impl (for HttpClient3.1)\r\n\r\nI didn&#39;t find anything wrong.\r\n\r\nI tried the authentication via Java code. Following is the implementation of the authentication using common-httpclient-3.1:\r\n\r\n    import java.io.IOException;\r\n    \r\n    import org.apache.commons.httpclient.Credentials;\r\n    import org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient;\r\n    import org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpException;\r\n    import org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethod;\r\n    import org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpState;\r\n    import org.apache.commons.httpclient.NTCredentials;\r\n    import org.apache.commons.httpclient.auth.AuthScope;\r\n    import org.apache.commons.httpclient.methods.GetMethod;\r\n    \r\n    public class NTLMAuthenticationHttpClient {\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic static void main(String[] args) throws HttpException, IOException {\r\n    \t\tHttpClient client = new HttpClient();\r\n    \t\tCredentials credentials = new NTCredentials(&quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;NTLM_DOMAIN&quot;);\r\n    \t\tHttpState state = client.getState();\r\n    \t\tstate.setCredentials(AuthScope.ANY, credentials);\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tString domain = &quot;my_domain&quot;;\r\n    \t\tString protocol = &quot;https&quot;;\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tHttpMethod method = new GetMethod(protocol + &quot;://&quot;

This code was taked from the [HTTP Components site][1], which is using JCIFS.\r\n\r\nI am unable to find any cause for the Unauthorization. Does JMeter or the HTTPClient supports NTLM Authentication fully? I am having some doubt after reading this note from the above site:\r\n\r\n&gt; NTLM is a proprietary authentication scheme developed by Microsoft and\r\n&gt; optimized for Windows operating system. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Until year 2008 there was no\r\n&gt; official, publicly available, complete documentation of the protocol.\r\n&gt; Unofficial 3rd party protocol descriptions existed as a result of\r\n&gt; reverse-engineering efforts. It was not really known whether the\r\n&gt; protocol based on the reverse-engineering were complete or even\r\n&gt; correct.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Microsoft published MS-NLMP and MS-NTHT specifications in\r\n&gt; February 2008 as a part of its Interoperability Principles initiative.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; HttpClient as of version 4.1 initially supported NTLMv1, NTLMv2, and\r\n&gt; NTLM2SessionResponse authentication protocols, based on the reverse\r\n&gt; engineering approach. As of version 4.2.3, HttpClient now supports a\r\n&gt; more correct implementation, based in large part on Microsoft&#39;s own\r\n&gt; specifications. This is expected to correct a number of problems,\r\n&gt; especially since Microsoft (as of Windows Server 2008 R2) began using\r\n&gt; a new implementation of its protocols. This new Microsoft\r\n&gt; implementation has led to authentication failures in some cases from\r\n&gt; some of the older reverse-engineered client implementations of NTLM.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The new HttpClient NTLM implementation is known to have been tried\r\n&gt; successfully against at least the following systems: \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; - Windows Server 2000 and Server 2003 systems, configured to use LM and NTLMv1\r\n&gt; authentication\r\n&gt; - Windows Server 2003 systems, configured to use NTLMv2\r\n&gt; authentication\r\n&gt; - Windows Server 2008 R2 systems, configured to use\r\n&gt; NTLM2SessionResponse authentication \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; If the current HttpClient NTLM implementation should prove problematic in your environment, we&#39;d definitely like to hear about it.\r\n\r\nIn browser when I am browing the URL which I have used for the authentication it is asking for the credential then it is navigating to the home page. There is another intermediate page which returns HTTP 302 for the redirection.\r\n\r\nAny suggestion will be a big help for me.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n-\r\nIn JMeter following is the result I am getting with the Response Header:\r\n\r\n    Thread Name: Thread Group 1-1\r\n    Sample Start: 2015-04-26 14:26:39 IST\r\n    Load time: 3837\r\n    Connect Time: 2716\r\n    Latency: 3837\r\n    Size in bytes: 940\r\n    Headers size in bytes: 940\r\n    Body size in bytes: 0\r\n    Sample Count: 1\r\n    Error Count: 1\r\n    Response code: 401\r\n    Response message: Unauthorized\r\n    \r\n    Response headers:\r\n    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\r\n    Cache-Control: max-age=0\r\n    Content-Type: text/plain\r\n    Date: Sun, 26 Apr 2015 08:56:42 GMT\r\n    Expires: Sun, 26 Apr 2015 08:56:43 GMT\r\n    Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1\r\n    Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=0D39812DAECAED077E7A9001864874A9.schbapxu1044_SEP; Expires=Sun, 26-Apr-2015 16:56:42 GMT; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly\r\n    Set-Cookie: dtCookie=2929007D72E613D13BF40F8241EC4B9F|X2RlZmF1bHR8MQ; Path=/; Domain=.my_domain_part2\r\n    Set-Cookie: AWSELB=C5C5577906943F772312365AC913FBE510FFA9A080FC6FD7778CB3F66B01593D16E110291976D6D7D50FBFB1DB51745A84041319D726B0F898FAE4520DC36E25BB9AE95FBCB14D902FBC9B5903E8BCB6E32414584F;PATH=/;EXPIRES=Sun, 26-Apr-2015 16:56:42 GMT;SECURE;HTTPONLY\r\n    Vary: Accept-Encoding\r\n    Via: 1.1 my_domain_part1.my_domain_part2\r\n    WWW-Authenticate: NTLM\r\n    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\r\n    X-dynaTrace-JS-Agent: true\r\n    X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\r\n    X-XSS-Protection: 1\r\n    Content-Length: 0\r\n    Connection: keep-alive\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    HTTPSampleResult fields:\r\n    ContentType: text/plain\r\n    DataEncoding: null\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.3.x/ntlm.html","title":"Does JMeter fully support NTLM Authentication?","body":"<p>I am struggling to make JMeter to work with NTLM authentication. At the beginning I was provided with an URL and credential. When I tested the credential in Firefox and in Chrome I received the authentication popup and upon providing the credential I was authenticated. So I had created a Test Plan with the following configuration:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>HTTP Authorization Manager</li>\n<li>HTTP Request Default</li>\n<li>HTTP Request</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I didn't know about the requirement of the Domain for the NTLM Authentication Schema. So eventually the JMeter was failing to authenticate and was returning HTTP 401 error.</p>\n\n<p>Then I tried Bad boy to record the test script. When I had entered the URL in Bad boy I received Windows Authentication Popup and the given credential didn't work in Bad boy.</p>\n\n<p>So I tried the IE and received same Windows Authentication Popup and the credential didn't worked. I asked for the domain and upon providing that domain in IE as Domain\\Username I was successful to authenticate that user.</p>\n\n<p>I tried the same with the JMeter and have provided the Domain in the HTTP Authorization Manager. Unfortunately it didn't work in JMeter. Following is my Test Plan.

Does JMeter or the HTTPClient supports NTLM Authentication fully? I am having some doubt after reading this note from the above site:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>NTLM is a proprietary authentication scheme developed by Microsoft and\n  optimized for Windows operating system. </p>\n  \n  <p>Until year 2008 there was no\n  official, publicly available, complete documentation of the protocol.\n  Unofficial 3rd party protocol descriptions existed as a result of\n  reverse-engineering efforts. It was not really known whether the\n  protocol based on the reverse-engineering were complete or even\n  correct.</p>\n  \n  <p>Microsoft published MS-NLMP and MS-NTHT specifications in\n  February 2008 as a part of its Interoperability Principles initiative.</p>\n  \n  <p>HttpClient as of version 4.1 initially supported NTLMv1, NTLMv2, and\n  NTLM2SessionResponse authentication protocols, based on the reverse\n  engineering approach. As of version 4.2.3, HttpClient now supports a\n  more correct implementation, based in large part on Microsoft's own\n  specifications. This is expected to correct a number of problems,\n  especially since Microsoft (as of Windows Server 2008 R2) began using\n  a new implementation of its protocols. This new Microsoft\n  implementation has led to authentication failures in some cases from\n  some of the older reverse-engineered client implementations of NTLM.</p>\n  \n  <p>The new HttpClient NTLM implementation is known to have been tried\n  successfully against at least the following systems: </p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Windows Server 2000 and Server 2003 systems, configured to use LM and NTLMv1\n  authentication</li>\n  <li>Windows Server 2003 systems, configured to use NTLMv2\n  authentication</li>\n  <li>Windows Server 2008 R2 systems, configured to use\n  NTLM2SessionResponse authentication </li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>If the current HttpClient NTLM implementation should prove problematic in your environment, we'd definitely like to hear about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In browser when I am browing the URL which I have used for the authentication it is asking for the credential then it is navigating to the home page. There is another intermediate page which returns HTTP 302 for the redirection.</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestion will be a big help for me.</p>\n\n<h2>Update:</h2>\n\n<p>In JMeter following is the result I am getting with the Response Header:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Thread Name: Thread Group 1-1\nSample Start: 2015-04-26 14:26:39 IST\nLoad time: 3837\nConnect Time: 2716\nLatency: 3837\nSize in bytes: 940\nHeaders size in bytes: 940\nBody size in bytes: 0\nSample Count: 1\nError Count: 1\nResponse code: 401\nResponse message: Unauthorized\n\nResponse headers:\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nCache-Control: max-age=0\nContent-Type: text/plain\nDate: Sun, 26 Apr 2015 08:56:42 GMT\nExpires: Sun, 26 Apr 2015 08:56:43 GMT\nServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1\nSet-Cookie: JSESSIONID=0D39812DAECAED077E7A9001864874A9.schbapxu1044_SEP; Expires=Sun, 26-Apr-2015 16:56:42 GMT; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly\nSet-Cookie: dtCookie=2929007D72E613D13BF40F8241EC4B9F|X2RlZmF1bHR8MQ; Path=/; Domain=.my_domain_part2\nSet-Cookie: AWSELB=C5C5577906943F772312365AC913FBE510FFA9A080FC6FD7778CB3F66B01593D16E110291976D6D7D50FBFB1DB51745A84041319D726B0F898FAE4520DC36E25BB9AE95FBCB14D902FBC9B5903E8BCB6E32414584F;PATH=/;EXPIRES=Sun, 26-Apr-2015 16:56:42 GMT;SECURE;HTTPONLY\nVary: Accept-Encoding\nVia: 1.1 my_domain_part1.my_domain_part2\nWWW-Authenticate: NTLM\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nX-dynaTrace-JS-Agent: true\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nX-XSS-Protection: 1\nContent-Length: 0\nConnection: keep-alive\n\n\nHTTPSampleResult fields:\nContentType: text/plain\nDataEncoding: null\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","priority-queue","max-heap"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":39208,"reputation":251240,"user_id":112968,"accept_rate":68,"display_name":"knittl"},"score":0,"creation_date":1665825312,"post_id":74078030,"comment_id":130792510,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m not sure I follow.

How it can be a ‘better solution’ I explain in section three. How it can nevertheless be ‘subtle and hard to use correctly’ I show by example in the fourth and final section.\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;1. Correct threading&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nIn what situations might an empty `synchronized` block enable correct threading?\r\n\r\nConsider an example.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-java --&gt;\r\n\r\n    import static java.lang.System.exit;\r\n\r\n    class Example { // Incorrect, might never exit\r\n\r\n        public static void main( String[] _args ) { new Example().enter(); }\r\n\r\n        void enter() {\r\n            new Thread( () -&gt; { // A\r\n                for( ;; ) {\r\n                    toExit = true; }})\r\n                .start();\r\n            new Thread( () -&gt; { // B\r\n                for( ;; ) {\r\n                    if( toExit ) exit( 0 ); }})\r\n                .start(); }\r\n\r\n        boolean toExit; }\r\n\r\nThe code above is incorrect. The runtime might isolate thread A’s change to the boolean variable `toExit`, effectively hiding it from B, which would then loop forever.\r\n\r\nIt can be corrected by introducing empty `synchronized` blocks, as follows.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-java --&gt;\r\n\r\n    import static java.lang.System.exit;\r\n\r\n    class Example { // Corrected\r\n\r\n        public static void main( String[] _args ) { new Example().enter(); }\r\n\r\n        void enter() {\r\n            new Thread( () -&gt; { // A\r\n                for( ;; ) {\r\n                    toExit = true;\r\n                    synchronized( o ) {} }}) // Force exposure of the change\r\n                .start();\r\n            new Thread( () -&gt; { // B\r\n                for( ;; ) {\r\n                    synchronized( o ) {} // Seek exposed changes\r\n                    if( toExit ) exit( 0 ); }})\r\n                .start(); }\r\n\r\n        static final Object o = new Object();\r\n\r\n        boolean toExit; }\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;2. Basis for correctness&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nHow do the empty `synchronized` blocks make the code correct?\r\n\r\nThe Java memory model guarantees that an ‘unlock action on monitor m *synchronizes-with* all subsequent lock actions on m’ and thereby *happens-before* those actions ([&#167;17.4.4][17-4-4]). So the *unlock* of monitor `o` at the tail of A’s `synchronized` block *happens-before* its eventual *lock* at the head of B’s `synchronized` block. And because A’s *write* to the variable precedes its unlock and B’s lock precedes its *read*, the guarantee extends to the write and read operations: *write happens-before read*.\r\n\r\nNow, ‘[if] one action happens-before another, then the first is visible to and ordered before the second’ ([&#167;17.4.5][17-4-5]). It is this visibility guarantee that makes the code correct in terms of the memory model.\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;3. Comparative utility&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nHow might an empty `synchronized` block be a better solution than the alternatives?\r\n\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Versus a non-empty `synchronized` block&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n\r\nOne alternative is a *non*-empty `synchronized` block. A non-empty `synchronized` block does two things: a) it provides the ordering and visibility guarantee described in the previous section, effectively forcing the exposure of memory changes across all threads that synchronize on the same monitor; and b) it makes the code within the block effectively atomic among those threads; the execution of that code will not be interleaved with the execution of other block-synchronized code.\r\n\r\nAn empty `synchronized` block does only (a) above. In situations where (a) alone is required and (b) could have significant costs, the empty `synchronized` block might be a better solution.\r\n\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Versus a `volatile` modifier&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n\r\nAnother alternative is a `volatile` modifier attached to the declaration of a particular variable, thereby forcing exposure of its changes. An empty `synchronized` block differs in applying not to any particular variable, but to all of them. In situations where a wide range of variables have changes that need exposing, the empty `synchronized` block might be a better solution.\r\n\r\nMoreover a `volatile` modifier forces exposure of each separate write to the variable, exposing each across all threads. An empty `synchronized` block differs both in the timing of the exposure (only when the block executes) and in its extent (only to threads that synchronize on the same monitor). In situations where a narrower focus of timing and extent could have significant cost benefits, the empty `synchronized` block might be a better solution for that reason.\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;4. Correctness revisited&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\nConcurrent programming is difficult. So it should come as no surprise that empty `synchronized` blocks can be ‘subtle and hard to use correctly’. One way to misuse them (mentioned by Holger) is shown in the example below.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-java --&gt;\r\n\r\n    import static java.lang.System.exit;\r\n\r\n    class Example { // Incorrect, might exit with a value of 0 instead of 1\r\n\r\n        public static void main( String[] _args ) { new Example().enter(); }\r\n\r\n        void enter() {\r\n            new Thread( () -&gt; { // A\r\n                for( ;; ) {\r\n                    exitValue = 1;\r\n                    toExit = true;\r\n                    synchronized( o ) {} }})\r\n                .start();\r\n            new Thread( () -&gt; { // B\r\n                for( ;; ) {\r\n                    synchronized( o ) {}\r\n                    if( toExit ) exit( exitValue ); }})\r\n                .start(); }\r\n\r\n        static final Object o = new Object();\r\n\r\n        int exitValue;\r\n\r\n        boolean toExit; }\r\n\r\nThread B’s statement “`if( toExit ) exit( exitValue )`” assumes a synchrony between the two variables that the code does not warrant. Suppose B happens to read `toExit` and `exitValue` after they’re written by A, yet before the subsequent execution of both `synchronized` statements (A’s then B’s). Then what B sees may be the updated value of the first variable (`true`) together with the *un*-updated value of the second (zero), causing it to exit with the wrong value.\r\n\r\nOne way to correct the code is through the mediation of final fields.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-java --&gt;\r\n\r\n    import static java.lang.System.exit;\r\n\r\n    class Example { // Corrected\r\n\r\n        public static void main( String[] _args ) { new Example().enter(); }\r\n\r\n        void enter() {\r\n            new Thread( () -&gt; { // A\r\n                for( ;; ) if( !state.toExit() ) {\r\n                    state = new State( /*toExit*/true, /*exitValue*/1 );\r\n                    synchronized( o ) {} }})\r\n                .start();\r\n            new Thread( () -&gt; { // B\r\n                for( ;; ) {\r\n                    synchronized( o ) {}\r\n                    State state = this.state; /* Local cache.  It might seem\r\n                      unnecessary when `state` is known to change once only,\r\n                      but see &#167; Subtleties in the text. */\r\n                    if( state.toExit ) exit( state.exitValue ); }})\r\n                .start(); }\r\n\r\n        static final Object o = new Object();\r\n\r\n        static record State( boolean toExit, int exitValue ) {}\r\n\r\n        State state = new State( /*toExit*/false, /*exitValue*/0 ); }\r\n\r\nThe revised code is correct because the Java memory model guarantees that, when B reads the new value of `state` written by A, it will see the fully initialized values of the final fields `toExit` and `exitValue`, both being implicitly final in the declaration of `State`. ‘A thread that can only see a reference to an object after that object has been completely initialized is guaranteed to see the correctly initialized values for that object&#39;s final fields.’ ([&#167;17.5][17-5])\r\n\r\nCrucial to the general utility of this technique (though irrelevant in the present example), the specification goes on to say: ‘It will also see versions of any object or array referenced by those final fields that are at least as up-to-date as the final fields are.’ So the guarantee of synchrony extends deeply into data structures.\r\n\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Subtleties&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n\r\nLocal caching of the `state` variable by thread B (example above) might seem unnecessary when `state` is known to change once only.

How it can be a ‘better solution’ I explain in section three. How it can nevertheless be ‘subtle and hard to use correctly’ I show by example in the fourth and final section.</p>\n<h2>1. Correct threading</h2>\n<p>In what situations might an empty <code>synchronized</code> block enable correct threading?</p>\n<p>Consider an example.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import static java.lang.System.exit;\n\nclass Example { // Incorrect, might never exit\n\n    public static void main( String[] _args ) { new Example().enter(); }\n\n    void enter() {\n        new Thread( () -&gt; { // A\n            for( ;; ) {\n                toExit = true; }})\n            .start();\n        new Thread( () -&gt; { // B\n            for( ;; ) {\n                if( toExit ) exit( 0 ); }})\n            .start(); }\n\n    boolean toExit; }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The code above is incorrect. The runtime might isolate thread A’s change to the boolean variable <code>toExit</code>, effectively hiding it from B, which would then loop forever.</p>\n<p>It can be corrected by introducing empty <code>synchronized</code> blocks, as follows.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import static java.lang.System.exit;\n\nclass Example { // Corrected\n\n    public static void main( String[] _args ) { new Example().enter(); }\n\n    void enter() {\n        new Thread( () -&gt; { // A\n            for( ;; ) {\n                toExit = true;\n                synchronized( o ) {} }}) // Force exposure of the change\n            .start();\n        new Thread( () -&gt; { // B\n            for( ;; ) {\n                synchronized( o ) {} // Seek exposed changes\n                if( toExit ) exit( 0 ); }})\n            .start(); }\n\n    static final Object o = new Object();\n\n    boolean toExit; }\n</code></pre>\n<h2>2. Basis for correctness</h2>\n<p>How do the empty <code>synchronized</code> blocks make the code correct?</p>\n<p>The Java memory model guarantees that an ‘unlock action on monitor m <em>synchronizes-with</em> all subsequent lock actions on m’ and thereby <em>happens-before</em> those actions (<a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se18/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">§17.4.4</a>). So the <em>unlock</em> of monitor <code>o</code> at the tail of A’s <code>synchronized</code> block <em>happens-before</em> its eventual <em>lock</em> at the head of B’s <code>synchronized</code> block. And because A’s <em>write</em> to the variable precedes its unlock and B’s lock precedes its <em>read</em>, the guarantee extends to the write and read operations: <em>write happens-before read</em>.</p>\n<p>Now, ‘[if] one action happens-before another, then the first is visible to and ordered before the second’ (<a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se18/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">§17.4.5</a>). It is this visibility guarantee that makes the code correct in terms of the memory model.</p>\n<h2>3. Comparative utility</h2>\n<p>How might an empty <code>synchronized</code> block be a better solution than the alternatives?</p>\n<h4>Versus a non-empty `synchronized` block</h4>\n<p>One alternative is a <em>non</em>-empty <code>synchronized</code> block. A non-empty <code>synchronized</code> block does two things: a) it provides the ordering and visibility guarantee described in the previous section, effectively forcing the exposure of memory changes across all threads that synchronize on the same monitor; and b) it makes the code within the block effectively atomic among those threads; the execution of that code will not be interleaved with the execution of other block-synchronized code.</p>\n<p>An empty <code>synchronized</code> block does only (a) above. In situations where (a) alone is required and (b) could have significant costs, the empty <code>synchronized</code> block might be a better solution.</p>\n<h4>Versus a `volatile` modifier</h4>\n<p>Another alternative is a <code>volatile</code> modifier attached to the declaration of a particular variable, thereby forcing exposure of its changes. An empty <code>synchronized</code> block differs in applying not to any particular variable, but to all of them. In situations where a wide range of variables have changes that need exposing, the empty <code>synchronized</code> block might be a better solution.</p>\n<p>Moreover a <code>volatile</code> modifier forces exposure of each separate write to the variable, exposing each across all threads. An empty <code>synchronized</code> block differs both in the timing of the exposure (only when the block executes) and in its extent (only to threads that synchronize on the same monitor). In situations where a narrower focus of timing and extent could have significant cost benefits, the empty <code>synchronized</code> block might be a better solution for that reason.</p>\n<h2>4. Correctness revisited</h2>\n<p>Concurrent programming is difficult. So it should come as no surprise that empty <code>synchronized</code> blocks can be ‘subtle and hard to use correctly’. One way to misuse them (mentioned by Holger) is shown in the example below.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import static java.lang.System.exit;\n\nclass Example { // Incorrect, might exit with a value of 0 instead of 1\n\n    public static void main( String[] _args ) { new Example().enter(); }\n\n    void enter() {\n        new Thread( () -&gt; { // A\n            for( ;; ) {\n                exitValue = 1;\n                toExit = true;\n                synchronized( o ) {} }})\n            .start();\n        new Thread( () -&gt; { // B\n            for( ;; ) {\n                synchronized( o ) {}\n                if( toExit ) exit( exitValue ); }})\n            .start(); }\n\n    static final Object o = new Object();\n\n    int exitValue;\n\n    boolean toExit; }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Thread B’s statement “<code>if( toExit ) exit( exitValue )</code>” assumes a synchrony between the two variables that the code does not warrant. Suppose B happens to read <code>toExit</code> and <code>exitValue</code> after they’re written by A, yet before the subsequent execution of both <code>synchronized</code> statements (A’s then B’s). Then what B sees may be the updated value of the first variable (<code>true</code>) together with the <em>un</em>-updated value of the second (zero), causing it to exit with the wrong value.</p>\n<p>One way to correct the code is through the mediation of final fields.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import static java.lang.System.exit;\n\nclass Example { // Corrected\n\n    public static void main( String[] _args ) { new Example().enter(); }\n\n    void enter() {\n        new Thread( () -&gt; { // A\n            for( ;; ) if( !state.toExit() ) {\n                state = new State( /*toExit*/true, /*exitValue*/1 );\n                synchronized( o ) {} }})\n            .start();\n        new Thread( () -&gt; { // B\n            for( ;; ) {\n                synchronized( o ) {}\n                State state = this.state; /* Local cache.  It might seem\n                  unnecessary when `state` is known to change once only,\n                  but see § Subtleties in the text. */\n                if( state.toExit ) exit( state.exitValue ); }})\n            .start(); }\n\n    static final Object o = new Object();\n\n    static record State( boolean toExit, int exitValue ) {}\n\n    State state = new State( /*toExit*/false, /*exitValue*/0 ); }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The revised code is correct because the Java memory model guarantees that, when B reads the new value of <code>state</code> written by A, it will see the fully initialized values of the final fields <code>toExit</code> and <code>exitValue</code>, both being implicitly final in the declaration of <code>State</code>. ‘A thread that can only see a reference to an object after that object has been completely initialized is guaranteed to see the correctly initialized values for that object's final fields.’ (<a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se18/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">§17.5</a>)</p>\n<p>Crucial to the general utility of this technique (though irrelevant in the present example), the specification goes on to say: ‘It will also see versions of any object or array referenced by those final fields that are at least as up-to-date as the final fields are.’ So the guarantee of synchrony extends deeply into data structures.</p>\n<h4>Subtleties</h4>\n<p>Local caching of the <code>state</code> variable by thread B (example above) might seem unnecessary when <code>state</code> is known to change once only. While it has its original value, the statement “<code>if( state.toExit ) exit( state.exitValue )</code>” will short circuit and read it once only; otherwise it will have its final value and be guaranteed not to change between the two reads. But as Holger points out, there is no such guarantee.</p>\n<p>Consider what could happen if we leave the caching out.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>new Thread( () -&gt; { // B\n    for( ;; ) {\n        synchronized( o ) {}\n     // State state = this.state;\n    //// not required when it’s known to change once only\n        if( state.toExit ) exit( state.exitValue ); }})\n    .start(); }\n</code></pre>\n<p>‘An implementation is free to produce any code it likes, as long as all resulting executions of a program produce a result that can be predicted by the memory model. <em>This provides a great deal of freedom for the implementor to perform a myriad of code transformations, including the reordering of actions and removal of unnecessary synchronization</em>.’ (<a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se18/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">§17.4</a>)</p>\n<p>Seeing therefore that “<code>if( state.toExit ) exit( state.exitValue )</code>” lies outside of the synchronized block, and that <code>state</code> is a non-volatile variable, the following transformation would be valid.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>new Thread( () -&gt; { // B\n    for( ;; ) {\n        synchronized( o ) {}\n     // State state = this.state;\n    //// not required when it’s known to change once only\n        State s = state;\n        if( state.toExit ) exit( s.exitValue ); }})\n    .start(); }\n</code></pre>\n<p>This might actually be how the code executes.

Because you’re trying to put a double into an integer array (regardless of being accessed through a number reference).\r\n\r\nThis means that you can fool the compiler, but you cannot fool the runtime type system. And this is so because arrays are what we call *reifiable types*. This means that at runtime Java knows that this array was actually instantiated as an array of integers which simply happens to be accessed through a reference of type `Number[]`.\r\n\r\nSo, as you can see, one thing is the actual type of the object, and another thing is the type of the reference that you use to access it, right?\r\n\r\n**The Problem with Java Generics**\r\n\r\nNow, the problem with Java generic types is that the type information is discarded by the compiler and it is not available at run time. This process is called [type erasure][1]. There are good reason for implementing generics like this in Java, but that&#39;s a long story, and it has to do, among other things, with binary compatibility with pre-existing code (see [How we got the generics we have](http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/valhalla/erasure.html)).\r\n\r\nBut the important point here is that since, at runtime there is no type information, there is no way to ensure that we are not committing heap pollution.\r\n\r\nFor instance,\r\n\r\n    List&lt;Integer&gt; myInts = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();\r\n    myInts.add(1);\r\n    myInts.add(2);\r\n    \r\n    List&lt;Number&gt; myNums = myInts; //compiler error\r\n    myNums.add(3.14); //heap pollution\r\n\r\nIf the Java compiler does not stop you from doing this, the runtime type system cannot stop you either, because there is no way, at runtime, to determine that this list was supposed to be a list of integers only. The Java runtime would let you put whatever you want into this list, when it should only contain integers, because when it was created, it was declared as a list of integers.\r\n\r\nAs such, the designers of Java made sure that you cannot fool the compiler. If you cannot fool the compiler (as we can do with arrays) you cannot fool the runtime type system either.\r\n\r\nAs such, we say that generic types are *non-reifiable*.\r\n\r\nEvidently, this would hamper polymorphism. Consider the following example:\r\n\r\n    static long sum(Number[] numbers) {\r\n       long summation = 0;\r\n       for(Number number : numbers) {\r\n          summation += number.longValue();\r\n       }\r\n       return summation;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow you could use it like this:\r\n\r\n    Integer[] myInts = {1,2,3,4,5};\r\n    Long[] myLongs = {1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L};\r\n    Double[] myDoubles = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0};\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(sum(myInts));\r\n    System.out.println(sum(myLongs));\r\n    System.out.println(sum(myDoubles));\r\n\r\nBut if you attempt to implement the same code with generic collections, you will not succeed:\r\n\r\n    static long sum(List&lt;Number&gt; numbers) {\r\n       long summation = 0;\r\n       for(Number number : numbers) {\r\n          summation += number.longValue();\r\n       }\r\n       return summation;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou would get compiler erros if you try to...\r\n\r\n    List&lt;Integer&gt; myInts = asList(1,2,3,4,5);\r\n    List&lt;Long&gt; myLongs = asList(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L);\r\n    List&lt;Double&gt; myDoubles = asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0);\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(sum(myInts)); //compiler error\r\n    System.out.println(sum(myLongs)); //compiler error\r\n    System.out.println(sum(myDoubles)); //compiler error\r\n\r\nThe solution is to learn to use two powerful features of Java generics known as covariance and contravariance.\r\n\r\n**Covariance**\r\n\r\nWith covariance you can read items from a structure, but you cannot write anything into it. All these are valid declarations.\r\n\r\n    List&lt;? extends Number&gt; myNums = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();\r\n    List&lt;? extends Number&gt; myNums = new ArrayList&lt;Float&gt;();\r\n    List&lt;? extends Number&gt; myNums = new ArrayList&lt;Double&gt;();\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd you can read from `myNums`:\r\n\r\n    Number n = myNums.get(0); \r\n\r\nBecause you can be sure that whatever the actual list contains, it can be upcasted to a Number (after all anything that extends Number is a Number, right?)\r\n\r\nHowever, you are not allowed to put anything into a covariant structure.\r\n\r\n    myNumst.add(45L); //compiler error\r\n\r\nThis would not be allowed, because Java cannot guarantee what is the actual type of the object in the generic structure. It can be anything that extends Number, but the compiler cannot be sure. So you can read, but not write.\r\n\r\n**Contravariance**\r\n\r\nWith contravariance you can do the opposite. You can put things into a generic structure, but you cannot read out from it.\r\n\r\n    List&lt;Object&gt; myObjs = new List&lt;Object&gt;();\r\n    myObjs.add(&quot;Luke&quot;);\r\n    myObjs.add(&quot;Obi-wan&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    List&lt;? super Number&gt; myNums = myObjs;\r\n    myNums.add(10);\r\n    myNums.add(3.14);\r\n\r\nIn this case, the actual nature of the object is a List of Objects, and through contravariance, you can put Numbers into it, basically because all numbers have Object as their common ancestor. As such, all Numbers are objects, and therefore this is valid.\r\n\r\nHowever, you cannot safely read anything from this contravariant structure assuming that you will get a number. \r\n\r\n    Number myNum = myNums.get(0); //compiler-error\r\n\r\nAs you can see, if the compiler allowed you to write this line, you would get a ClassCastException at runtime (because item 0 in the list is an Object, not a Number).\r\n\r\n**Get/Put Principle**\r\n\r\nAs such, use covariance when you only intend to take generic values out of a structure, use contravariance when you only intend to put generic values into a structure, and use the exact generic type when you intend to do both.\r\n\r\nThe best example I have is the following which copies any kind of numbers from one list into another list. It only *gets* items from the source, and it only *puts* items in the target.\r\n\r\n    public static void copy(List&lt;? extends Number&gt; source, List&lt;? super Number&gt; target) {\r\n        for(Number number : source) {\r\n            target.add(number);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThanks to the powers of covariance and contravariance this works for a case like this:\r\n\r\n    List&lt;Integer&gt; myInts = asList(1,2,3,4);\r\n    List&lt;Double&gt; myDoubles = asList(3.14, 6.28);\r\n    List&lt;Object&gt; myObjs = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;();\r\n    \r\n    copy(myInts, myObjs);\r\n    copy(myDoubles, myObjs);\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.6\r\n","title":"What is a difference between &lt;? super E&gt; and &lt;? extends E&gt;?","body":"<p>The reasons for this are based on how Java implements generics.</p>\n<p><strong>An Arrays Example</strong></p>\n<p>With arrays you can do this (arrays are covariant)</p>\n<pre><code>Integer[] myInts = {1,2,3,4};\nNumber[] myNumber = myInts;\n</code></pre>\n<p>But, what would happen if you try to do this?</p>\n<pre><code>myNumber[0] = 3.14; //attempt of heap pollution\n</code></pre>\n<p>This last line would compile just fine, but if you run this code, you could get an <code>ArrayStoreException</code>.

As a result, a single <code>size</code> parameter may suffice:</p>\n<pre><code>Pendulum pendulum = new Pendulum(500);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Use this parameter to derive subsequent geometry and define the pane's preferred size, confident that surrounding layout will cause it to adopt the desired size:</p>\n<pre><code>public Pendulum(double size) {\n    this.w = size;\n    this.h = size;\n    setPrefSize(w, h);\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the variation below, the <code>arc</code> is positioned at half the width and one fourth the height; the radii are half the size.

In fact, your code in `createSharedListViaStream` is fundamentally correct; instead, it is your `createSharedListViaLoop` that may be causing discrepancies in output.  \r\n\r\nThink about the following set of inputs:  \r\n`List1 = [SchoolObj(&quot;nameA&quot;,&quot;SchoolX&quot;), SchoolObj(&quot;nameC&quot;,&quot;SchoolZ&quot;)]`  \r\n`List2 = [SchoolObj(&quot;nameA&quot;,&quot;SchoolX&quot;), SchoolObj(&quot;nameA&quot;,&quot;SchoolX&quot;), SchoolObj(&quot;nameB&quot;,&quot;SchoolY&quot;)]`  \r\n\r\nHere, `createSharedListViaStream` will return the only element of the first list that appears in both lists: `SchoolObj(&quot;nameA&quot;,&quot;SchoolX&quot;)`. However, `createSharedListViaLoop` will return the following list: `[SchoolObj(&quot;nameA&quot;,&quot;SchoolX&quot;),SchoolObj(&quot;nameA&quot;,&quot;SchoolX&quot;)]`. More precisely, `createSharedListViaLoop` will collect the correct object, but it will do so twice. I suspect this to be the reason for the output of `createSharedListViaStream` to be &quot;incorrect&quot; based on comparison to the output of `createSharedListViaLoop`.  \r\n\r\nThe reason that `createSharedListViaLoop` does this duplication is based on the lack of termination of its inner for loop. Although we iterate over all elements of the first list to check if they are present in the second, finding a single match will suffice to add the element to the result. We can avoid redundant element addition by changing the inner loop to the following:\r\n```Java\r\nfor (SchoolObj one : listOne)\r\n    {\r\n    for (SchoolObj two : listTwo)\r\n    {\r\n        if (one.getName().equals(two.getName()) &amp;&amp; one.getSchool().equals(two.getSchool()))\r\n        {\r\n            result.add(one);\r\n            break;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAdditionally, if you don&#39;t want duplicate Objects in your list (by location in memory), you can use [distinct](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html#distinct--) like so:\r\n```Java\r\nList&lt;SchoolObj&gt; result = ...;\r\nresult = result.stream().distinct().collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n```\r\nAs a final caution, the above will keep the results distinct in the following scenario:\r\n```Java\r\nList&lt;SchoolObj&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\nSchoolObj duplicate = new SchoolObj(&quot;nameC&quot;, &quot;schoolD&quot;);\r\nlistOne.add(duplicate);\r\nlistOne.add(duplicate);\r\nlist.stream().distinct().forEach(System.out::println); \r\n// prints:\r\n// nameC schoolD\r\n```\r\nHowever, it will not work in the following scenario, unless you override the [equals](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals-java.lang.Object-) method for SchoolObj:\r\n```Java\r\nList&lt;SchoolObj&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\nlistOne.add(new SchoolObj(&quot;nameC&quot;, &quot;schoolD&quot;));\r\nlistOne.add(new SchoolObj(&quot;nameC&quot;, &quot;schoolD&quot;));\r\nlist.stream().distinct().forEach(System.out::println); \r\n// prints (unless Object::equals overridden)\r\n// nameC schoolD\r\n// nameC schoolD\r\n```","title":"Java 8 Streams - Compare two Lists&#39; object values and add value to new List?","body":"<p>Let's run through each part of the code.

After checking via EntityManager.contains() - they are in managed state in the method that is inside of JPA @PostUpdate event, so I expected same behaviour - persist changes without explicitly calling to save() method.</p>\n<p>Building.java</p>\n<pre><code>@ToString(callSuper = true, onlyExplicitlyIncluded = true)\n@EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = true, onlyExplicitlyIncluded = true)\n@NoArgsConstructor\n@FieldDefaults(level = AccessLevel.PRIVATE)\n@SuperBuilder(toBuilder = true)\n@Entity\n@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)\n@Table(name = &quot;BUILDING&quot;, schema = &quot;---&quot;)\n@EntityListeners(BuildingListener.class)\n@Where(clause = &quot;DELETED = 0&quot;)\npublic class Building extends BaseEntity {\n\n    String name;\n    String description;\n    Date endDate;\n    Project project;\n    Stage stage;\n    CustomType type;\n\n    @Column(name = &quot;NAME&quot;)\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n   @Column(name = &quot;DESCRIPTION&quot;)\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n   @Column(name = &quot;END_DATE&quot;)\n    public Date getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    @ManyToOne(fetch = LAZY)\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;PROJECT_ID&quot;)\n    public Project getProject() {\n        return project;\n    }\n\n    @ManyToOne(fetch = LAZY)\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;STAGE_ID&quot;)\n    public Stage getStage() {\n        return stage;\n    }\n\n@ManyToOne\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;TYPE&quot;)\n    public CustomType getType(){\n        return type;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Project.java</p>\n<pre><code>@Data\n@ToString(callSuper = true, onlyExplicitlyIncluded = true)\n@EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = true, onlyExplicitlyIncluded = true)\n@NoArgsConstructor\n@FieldDefaults(level = AccessLevel.PRIVATE)\n@SuperBuilder(toBuilder = true)\n@Entity\n@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)\n@Table(name = &quot;PROJECT&quot;, schema = &quot;---&quot;)\n@Where(clause = &quot;DELETED = 0&quot;)\npublic class Project extends BaseEntity {\n\n    String name;\n    String description;\n    List&lt;Stage&gt;
