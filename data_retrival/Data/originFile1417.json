So for **each** posts filename, I need it to be added to the end of the URL link in getPost_img_complete for viewing so that all posts can have the images be viewed when the page is loaded. I think it may have something to do with the fact that I am using a list this time compared to before where I was not (In my user profile example I showed above). If anyone could help me understand what I need to do to accomplish this, it would be a HUGE help. Sorry it took so long to get to the point, I just wanted to include the right information for context on my problem.

This is what I have tried so far in my UserPostController:</p>\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code> @GetMapping(\"/list\")\n    @JsonIgnoreProperties({\"hibernateLazyInitializer\", \"handler\"})\n    public List&lt;UserPost&gt; post(Model model) {\n\n        List&lt;UserPost&gt; allUserPosts = userPostRepo.findAllByOrderByIdDesc();\n\n        model.addAttribute(\"post_image\", allUserPosts.getPost_img_complete()); // Error here: Cannot resolve method 'getPost_img_complete' in 'List'\n\n        return allUserPosts;\n    }</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n<p>Here is my UserPost entity class (Using JPA + Hibernate) that contains my getPost_img_complete() method with the URL link I am talking about:</p>\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>package com.Application.models;\n\nimport javax.persistence.*;\n\n@Entity\n@Table(name = \"user_posts\")\npublic class UserPost {\n    @Id\n    @Column(name = \"id\")\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n    private Long id;\n\n    @ManyToOne(cascade = {CascadeType.ALL}, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\n    @JoinColumn(name = \"user_id\", nullable = false)\n    private UserProfile user;\n\n    @Column(name = \"title\")\n    private String title;\n\n    @Column(name = \"post_image\")\n    private String postImage;\n\n    public void setId(Long id) {\n        this.id = id;\n    }\n\n\n    public Long getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n\n    public UserProfile getUser() {\n        return user;\n    }\n\n    public void setUser(UserProfile user) {\n        this.user = user;\n    }\n\n    public String getTitle() {\n        return title;\n    }\n\n    public void setTitle(String title) {\n        this.title = title;\n    }\n\n    public String getPostImage() {\n        return postImage;\n    }\n\n    public String getPost_img_complete() {\n        return \" https://bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/\" + postImage;\n    }\n\n    public void setPostImage(String postImage) {\n        this.postImage = postImage;\n    }\n}</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n<p>I know this may not be the most efficient way of pulling images stored in an S3 bucket, but it is what I am doing at the moment. So for <strong>each</strong> posts filename, I need it to be added to the end of the URL link in getPost_img_complete for viewing so that all posts can have the images be viewed when the page is loaded. I think it may have something to do with the fact that I am using a list this time compared to before where I was not (In my user profile example I showed above). If anyone could help me understand what I need to do to accomplish this, it would be a HUGE help. Sorry it took so long to get to the point, I just wanted to include the right information for context on my problem. Thanks in advance, I will add any information that would help me solve this problem if necessary.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","string","enums","compare"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":44321,"reputation":9248,"user_id":130028,"accept_rate":79,"display_name":"marcolopes"},"score":13,"creation_date":1360138314,"post_id":1167982,"comment_id":20598818,"body_markdown":"I really don&#39;t understand the idea behind emum valueOf throwing an exception... it does not make any sense.

My table stores &quot;Employees&quot; and &quot;Organizations&quot; and creates a many-to-many relationship between the two of them.\r\n\r\nI am struggling with how to use DynamoDBMapper to model both the entities and my table. Particularly when trying to write queries that will return both Employees and Organizations.\r\n\r\nIn my Java code, I&#39;ve started by representing these entities using two classes.\r\n\r\nEmployee.java\r\n```java\r\n@DynamoDBTable(tableName = &quot;workplaces&quot;)\r\npublic class Employee() {\r\n  @DynamoDBHashKey(attributeName = &quot;pk&quot;)\r\n  public String employeeId;\r\n\r\n  @DynamoDBRangeKey(attributeName = &quot;sk&quot;)\r\n  public String sortKey\r\n\r\n  // Other attributes specific to employees, as well as getters and setters\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd Organization.java:\r\n```java\r\n@DynamoDBTable(tableName = &quot;workplaces&quot;)\r\npublic class Organization() {\r\n  @DynamoDBHashKey(attributeName = &quot;pk&quot;)\r\n  public String organizationId;\r\n\r\n  @DynamoDBRangeKey(attributeName = &quot;sk&quot;)\r\n  public String sortKey\r\n\r\n  // Other attributes specific to organizations, as well as getters and setters\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of my query access patterns is, &quot;Retrieve an organization&#39;s details and all of its employees&quot;. I have designed my table schema in a way which allows me to retrieve all of these items within a single query.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m struggling with how to write this query in Java using DynamoDbMapper. Both DynamoDBQueryExpression and the mapper.query() function require a class to instantiate and hydrate. Since my query result set will contain both types of objects, I don&#39;t think I can supply these functions with either Employee.class or Organization.class. \r\n\r\nMy idea was to just try supplying Object.class, but that doesn&#39;t work because DynamoDBMapper expects the supplied class to include the DynamoDB annotations.\r\n\r\nTest.java:\r\n```java\r\nDynamoDBMapper mapper = new DynamoDBMapper();\r\nDynamoDBQueryExpression&lt;Object&gt; queryExpression = new DynamoDBQueryExpression&lt;Object&gt;()\r\n  .withHashKeyValues(&quot;blah&quot;)\r\n  .withRangeKeyCondition(&quot;blah&quot;);\r\nList&lt;Object&gt; queryResult = mapper.query(Object.class, queryExpression);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am thinking that the only way around this is to create a &quot;master&quot; class which truly represents all objects in my table, something like:\r\n```java\r\n@DynamoDBTable(tableName = &quot;workplaces&quot;)\r\npublic class WorkplaceItem() {\r\n  // All attributes from both the Employee and Organization classes\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, all of my queries would be done on the WorkplaceItem class, and I&#39;d be responsible for adding some business logic to convert a WorkplaceItem into a more specific Employee or Organization within the java code.\r\n\r\nIs this the right approach?

Particularly when trying to write queries that will return both Employees and Organizations.</p>\n<p>In my Java code, I've started by representing these entities using two classes.</p>\n<p>Employee.java</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@DynamoDBTable(tableName = &quot;workplaces&quot;)\npublic class Employee() {\n  @DynamoDBHashKey(attributeName = &quot;pk&quot;)\n  public String employeeId;\n\n  @DynamoDBRangeKey(attributeName = &quot;sk&quot;)\n  public String sortKey\n\n  // Other attributes specific to employees, as well as getters and setters\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And Organization.java:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@DynamoDBTable(tableName = &quot;workplaces&quot;)\npublic class Organization() {\n  @DynamoDBHashKey(attributeName = &quot;pk&quot;)\n  public String organizationId;\n\n  @DynamoDBRangeKey(attributeName = &quot;sk&quot;)\n  public String sortKey\n\n  // Other attributes specific to organizations, as well as getters and setters\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>One of my query access patterns is, &quot;Retrieve an organization's details and all of its employees&quot;. I have designed my table schema in a way which allows me to retrieve all of these items within a single query.</p>\n<p>I'm struggling with how to write this query in Java using DynamoDbMapper. Both DynamoDBQueryExpression and the mapper.query() function require a class to instantiate and hydrate. Since my query result set will contain both types of objects, I don't think I can supply these functions with either Employee.class or Organization.class.</p>\n<p>My idea was to just try supplying Object.class, but that doesn't work because DynamoDBMapper expects the supplied class to include the DynamoDB annotations.</p>\n<p>Test.java:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>DynamoDBMapper mapper = new DynamoDBMapper();\nDynamoDBQueryExpression&lt;Object&gt; queryExpression = new DynamoDBQueryExpression&lt;Object&gt;()\n  .withHashKeyValues(&quot;blah&quot;)\n  .withRangeKeyCondition(&quot;blah&quot;);\nList&lt;Object&gt; queryResult = mapper.query(Object.class, queryExpression);\n</code></pre>\n<p>I am thinking that the only way around this is to create a &quot;master&quot; class which truly represents all objects in my table, something like:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@DynamoDBTable(tableName = &quot;workplaces&quot;)\npublic class WorkplaceItem() {\n  // All attributes from both the Employee and Organization classes\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, all of my queries would be done on the WorkplaceItem class, and I'd be responsible for adding some business logic to convert a WorkplaceItem into a more specific Employee or Organization within the java code.</p>\n<p>Is this the right approach? It would be a substantial change to my codebase so I'm curious if there is a better way to accomplish what I want before I start making this change.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","bash","shell","sh"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":5225716,"reputation":3752,"user_id":4177828,"display_name":"ufopilot"},"score":1,"creation_date":1650405672,"post_id":71924800,"comment_id":127106897,"body_markdown":"-q, --brief  report only when files differ","body":"-q, --brief  report only when files differ"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2686715,"reputation":8194,"user_id":2320961,"display_name":"Nic3500"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1650418676,"creation_date":1650418676,"answer_id":71933162,"question_id":71924800,"body_markdown":"You can do this:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    \r\n    /bin/ls -c1 original_dir &gt;original_list.txt\r\n    /bin/ls -c1 copy_dir &gt;copy_list.txt\r\n\r\n    diff original_list.txt copy_list.txt\r\n\r\nThis will list all new files from the copy directory.\r\n","title":"How find only the newly added/created files when comparing two folders?","body":"<p>You can do this:</p>\n<pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n\n/bin/ls -c1 original_dir &gt;original_list.txt\n/bin/ls -c1 copy_dir &gt;copy_list.txt\n\ndiff original_list.txt copy_list.txt\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will list all new files from the copy directory.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":25003338,"reputation":1,"user_id":18863541,"display_name":"Kino"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1650418676,"creation_date":1650370607,"question_id":71924800,"body_markdown":"I have 2 folders where one is an initial copy from the other one and I want to check the newly added/created files in the original folder every N seconds (I do the timer in Java), so I am using `diff -r original_dir copy_dir`. &lt;br /&gt;\r\nThe problem was that `diff` detects and returns other changes too like the changes in files so it is difficult to wrap the output in Java for each case. &lt;br /&gt;\r\nSo how can I only list the different files only using `diff` and ignore the changes in their content/date/size?
