This is specified in [the documentation of the `Package` class]:\r\n\r\n&gt; A `Package` automatically defined for classes in a named module has the following properties:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; - The name of the package is derived from the [binary names] of the classes. Since classes in a named module must be in a named package, the derived name is never empty.\r\n&gt; - The package is sealed with the [module location] as the code source, if known.\r\n&gt; - The specification and implementation titles, versions, and vendors are unspecified.\r\n&gt; - Any annotations on the package are read from `package-info.class` as specified above.\r\n\r\nI also made a quick test to verify that `isSealed()` on a module’s package did indeed return `true`. However, it must be noted that the relationship between (named) modules and packages is of a fundamental nature and hence, independent of the fact that `isSealed()` returns `true`.

Is this possible with Spring Boot, and if so how would I go about setting it up?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","rest","java-8","httpurlconnection","httpconnection"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3520251,"reputation":114,"user_id":2942745,"display_name":"cogitoboy"},"score":0,"creation_date":1652793864,"post_id":72272735,"comment_id":127688583,"body_markdown":"Maybe try `-Djavax.net.debug=ssl:handshake:verbose:keymanager:trustmanager -Djava.security.debug=access:stack`  to get the details of the conversation between you app and the server. e.g. &#39;Negotiated protocol version:&#39;","body":"Maybe try <code>-Djavax.net.debug=ssl:handshake:verbose:keymanager:trustmana&zwnj;&#8203;ger -Djava.security.debug=access:stack</code>  to get the details of the conversation between you app and the server. e.g. &#39;Negotiated protocol version:&#39;"},{"owner":{"account_id":1471077,"reputation":5601,"user_id":1382647,"accept_rate":43,"display_name":"fatherazrael"},"score":0,"creation_date":1652803166,"post_id":72272735,"comment_id":127692531,"body_markdown":"@cogitoboy:\n\nIt is already in logs\n\njavax.net.ssl|DEBUG|01|main|2022-05-17 16:29:48.838 IST|ServerHello.java:987|Negotiated protocol version: TLSv1.2.......but i don&#39;t actually understand what more to see, it is huge 4000 lines logs","body":"@cogitoboy:  It is already in logs  javax.net.ssl|DEBUG|01|main|2022-05-17 16:29:48.838 IST|ServerHello.java:987|Negotiated protocol version: TLSv1.2.......but i don&#39;t actually understand what more to see, it is huge 4000 lines logs"},{"owner":{"account_id":100492,"reputation":116,"user_id":270866,"display_name":"David Aguirre"},"score":0,"creation_date":1654852387,"post_id":72272735,"comment_id":128195891,"body_markdown":"@fatherazrael have you found the root cause?

it's a very dummy coffee shop application that includes multiple activities like a basic activity and a log in activity. However, I have currently created my first tabbed activity where the user can &quot;order&quot; coffee (first tab) and food (second tab) by selecting each CheckBox respectively as you can see in the images below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hcqoy.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">TAB 1 - COFFEE</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aLnPY.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">TAB 2 - FOOD</a></p>\n<p>As you can see, there are two buttons on the bottom of the screen, the &quot;GO BACK&quot; button that sends the user back to the main activity and another button next to it called &quot;ORDER NOW&quot; which is where I am stuck. Both buttons are visible in both tabs and I have an onClick method for the first button &quot;sendNotification&quot;. When I press that button it checks which check boxes are clicked and stores them accordingly inside the String <code>order</code> and then insert that value inside the notification. Everything works fine when I &quot;order&quot; coffees but no matter what selection I make in the second tab called &quot;FOOD&quot; it always sends an empty message like this &quot;Here is your oder:

will prompt the user to input the product details such as the name, amount, and price on the add Item GUI. it will then take the user input and list it on the main page. After that it will calculate the total amount of items on the list, it&#39;s amount, and total price. The problem is that I am currently stuck on how can I pass the user input from the Add Item GUI to the main page. I&#39;ve been researching but I still couldn&#39;t find my way around it. I hope you can help me and any help is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nP.S: I&#39;m sorry if you find my code a bit too long because this is what currently I could do with the best of my knowledge and abilities. But don&#39;t worry, I know that I shouldn&#39;t use setLayout(null) since swing has layout managers that I can use. I am still currently learning more about it so bear with me please.","title":"How to pass user input from one frame to another?","body":"<p>I'm currently a beginner in programming and I'm kind of having a hard time right now.

&quot;Add Item&quot; button from the Main page, it will prompt the user to input the product details such as the name, amount, and price on the add Item GUI. it will then take the user input and list it on the main page. After that it will calculate the total amount of items on the list, it's amount, and total price. The problem is that I am currently stuck on how can I pass the user input from the Add Item GUI to the main page. I've been researching but I still couldn't find my way around it. I hope you can help me and any help is much appreciated.</p>\n<p>P.S: I'm sorry if you find my code a bit too long because this is what currently I could do with the best of my knowledge and abilities. But don't worry, I know that I shouldn't use setLayout(null) since swing has layout managers that I can use. I am still currently learning more about it so bear with me please.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","performance","groovy","jmeter"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3460456,"reputation":162728,"user_id":2897748,"display_name":"Dmitri T"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1587029257,"creation_date":1587029257,"answer_id":61246936,"question_id":61228244,"body_markdown":"As per [JMeter Test Elements Execution Order][1]:\r\n\r\n1.
