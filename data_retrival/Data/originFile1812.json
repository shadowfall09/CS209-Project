Because of\r\n&gt; its many shortcomings, some expert programmers simply choose never to\r\n&gt; override the clone method and never to invoke it except, perhaps, to\r\n&gt; copy arrays.

It seems that more efficient solution is <code>StreamingResponseBody</code>.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":8727670,"reputation":469,"user_id":6528839,"display_name":"MauriRamone"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":1304,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":69045057,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1638093937,"creation_date":1630671584,"question_id":69044862,"body_markdown":"I am building an api with Java Spring Boot and what I want to do is use an endpoint to download a file.

I&#39;ll explain it briefly. At the moment I have 2 micro-services (then I will have more). The first one (this mentioned project) is intended to handle users on the database. It contains a specific controller method that take the user e-mail address (the username) and return all the user information to the other micro-service that will use these information in order to generate a JWT token. So this method is protected by **basic authentication** (so the micro-service that create the JWT token and the other that interact with the DB can communicate in a secure way using a &quot;service user credential&quot;). This project (the one on which we are speaking about that interact with the DB) will also contains some other APIs that are used from the clients so these APIs must be protected with a JWT token generated by the second micro-service.\r\n\r\nSo basically I am trying to split the Spring Security configuration using two configuration classes: \r\n\r\n1) The first configuration class protect my API intended to return the user details to the micro-service that will generate the JWT token. This behavior worked fine (I was able to call an authorization API on the microservice intended to generate the JWT token, this call the API that return the user information on this micro-service that interact with my DB and the token was correctly generated.\r\n\r\n2) The second configuration class is intended to protect all the other APIs that must be protected by a JWT token authentication (this because these are APIs called by the client to perform operation like: add a new user, change a specific user details, delete a user, list all the users, etcetc...so these are operation that can be performed by logged user with different privileges and these privileges are defined into my token).\r\n\r\nAnd here I am finding some difficulties.\r\n\r\nThis is my **SecurityConfiguration** configuration class that is intended to configure the basic authentication protecting the single API that take the username and return the user information to the other micro-service that will generate the JWT token:\r\n\r\n\t@Configuration\r\n\t@EnableWebSecurity\r\n\tpublic class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {\r\n\t\tprivate static String REALM = &quot;REAME&quot;;\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate static final String[] USER_MATCHER = { &quot;/api/user/email/**&quot;};\r\n\t\tprivate static final String[] ADMIN_MATCHER = { &quot;/api/user/email/**&quot;};\r\n\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tprotected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\thttp.csrf().disable()\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   .authorizeRequests()\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   .antMatchers(USER_MATCHER).hasAnyRole(&quot;USER&quot;)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   .antMatchers(ADMIN_MATCHER).hasAnyRole(&quot;ADMIN&quot;)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   .antMatchers(&quot;/api/users/test&quot;).permitAll()\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   //.antMatchers(&quot;/api/users/**&quot;).permitAll()\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   .anyRequest().authenticated()\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   .and()\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   .httpBasic().realmName(REALM).authenticationEntryPoint(getBasicAuthEntryPoint()).and()\r\n\t\t\t\t\t   .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t@Bean\r\n\t\tpublic AuthEntryPoint getBasicAuthEntryPoint()\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\treturn new AuthEntryPoint();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t/* To allow Pre-flight [OPTIONS] request from browser */\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tpublic void configure(WebSecurity web) \r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tweb.ignoring().antMatchers(HttpMethod.OPTIONS, &quot;/**&quot;);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t@Bean\r\n\t\tpublic BCryptPasswordEncoder passwordEncoder()\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\treturn new BCryptPasswordEncoder();\r\n\t\t};\r\n\r\n\t\t@Bean\r\n\t\t@Override\r\n\t\tpublic UserDetailsService userDetailsService()\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tUserBuilder users = User.builder();\r\n\r\n\t\t\tInMemoryUserDetailsManager manager = new InMemoryUserDetailsManager();\r\n\r\n\t\t\tmanager.createUser(users\r\n\t\t\t\t\t.username(&quot;ReadUser&quot;)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t.password(new BCryptPasswordEncoder().encode(&quot;BimBumBam_2018&quot;))\r\n\t\t\t\t\t.roles(&quot;USER&quot;).build());\r\n\r\n\t\t\tmanager.createUser(users\r\n\t\t\t\t\t.username(&quot;Admin&quot;)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t.password(new BCryptPasswordEncoder().encode(&quot;MagicaBula_2018&quot;))\r\n\t\t\t\t\t.roles(&quot;USER&quot;, &quot;ADMIN&quot;).build());\r\n\r\n\t\t\treturn manager;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nAs you can see this protect with the **basic authentication** the **/api/user/email/**** endpoint.

As long as you use the same query key, you will get data from its cache. This is best abstracted away in custom hooks.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that with the default values, you will get a &quot;background refetch&quot; if a new component mount, so you will see two network requests if you use it twice. That might look confusing at first, but it is intended, as it is not react-query&#39;s primary goal to reduce network requests, but to keep your data on the screen as up-to-date as possible. So when a new component mounts that uses a query, you&#39;ll get the stale data from the cache immediately, and then a background refetch will be done. This procedure is called [stale-while-revalidate][1].\r\n\r\nThe best way to customize this behaviour is to set the `staleTime` property to tell react-query how long your resource is &quot;valid&quot;.

As long as you use the same query key, you will get data from its cache. This is best abstracted away in custom hooks.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that with the default values, you will get a &quot;background refetch&quot; if a new component mount, so you will see two network requests if you use it twice. That might look confusing at first, but it is intended, as it is not react-query's primary goal to reduce network requests, but to keep your data on the screen as up-to-date as possible. So when a new component mounts that uses a query, you'll get the stale data from the cache immediately, and then a background refetch will be done. This procedure is called <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5861\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">stale-while-revalidate</a>.</p>\n<p>The best way to customize this behaviour is to set the <code>staleTime</code> property to tell react-query how long your resource is &quot;valid&quot;.

I get that I need a separate class \r\n\r\nYes, that is the difference, a separate class.\r\n\r\n - Implementing [`Comparable`][1] is done by adding a method `compareTo` within the  class of the objects being sorted. That means you are limited one single approach to sorting. \r\n - Implementing [`Comparator`][2] is done in a separate class. So we can more than one such `Comparator` implementation, for as many ways as we wish to sort our objects. \r\n\r\nFor example, a class `Student` representing people enrolled in a school might implement `Comparable` by adding a `compareTo` method that sorts by last name, and secondarily by first name. But in some contexts we might want to sort students by their grade level, and in other contexts by the date in which they first enrolled, and in yet other contexts we might sort by the distance between their home and the schoolhouse. For this other contexts we would write various classes implementing `Comparator`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to compare by a `getPriority` method that returns an `int` primitive, then your separate `Comparator` class might look like this. \r\n\r\n```\r\nclass ProcessByPriorityComparator implements Comparator&lt; Process &gt; {  \r\n    public int compare( Process p1 , Process p2 ){  \r\n        if( p1.getPriority() == p2.getPriority() )  \r\n        {\r\n            return 0;  \r\n        } \r\n        else if ( p1.getPriority() &gt; p1.getPriority() )\r\n        {\r\n            return 1;  \r\n        }\r\n        else  \r\n        { \r\n            return -1;  \r\n        }  \r\n    }\r\n}  \r\n```\r\n\r\nOr simplify:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass ProcessByPriorityComparator implements Comparator&lt; Process &gt; {  \r\n    public int compare( Process p1 , Process p2 ){  \r\n        return Integer.compare( p1.getPriority() , p2.getPriority() ) ;  \r\n    }\r\n}  \r\n```\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Comparator&lt; Process &gt; processByPriorityComparator = \r\n            new ProcessByPriorityComparator() ;\r\n    Collections.sort( listOfProcesses , processByPriorityComparator ) ;\r\n\r\nOr simply:\r\n\r\n    Collections.sort( listOfProcesses , new ProcessByPriorityComparator() ) ;\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nThe lambda functional functional features in Java makes it quite easy to define a `Comparator` locally rather than formally defining a separate class. \r\n\r\nGreatly helping to simplify this work are the static methods on `Comparator` such as `comparing`. So defining a `Comparator` can be as simple as using a [method reference][3] for an [accessor “getter” method][4] to sort by a particular property of the object. \r\n\r\nThis is quite appropriate in your particular case. We can use a method reference for the `Process#getPriority` method.\r\n\r\n    Comparator&lt; Process &gt; processByPriorityComparator = \r\n            Comparator.comparing( Process :: getPriority );\r\n    Collections.sort( listOfProcesses , processByPriorityComparator ) ;\r\n\r\nOr, more simply, drop the named variable holding the comparator.\r\n\r\n    Collections.sort( listOfProcesses , Comparator.comparing( Process :: getPriority ) )\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nBy the way, other issues with your code…\r\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and move that huge `main` method out to its own class. Create a separate class named something like `Main` or `App`. \r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class App {\r\n    public static void main( String[] args ) {\r\n        …\r\n    }\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I see no need for `Process` to be `static` nor be nested. \r\n\r\nI suspect you feel some compulsion to have everything squeezed into a single class or file. Not so in Java. In Java you should generally have many classes, smaller and separate. \r\n\r\nEventually, as your app grows, organize the many classes by using packages and possible modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Comparable.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Comparator.html\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methodreferences.html\r\n  [4]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutator_method#Java","title":"Implementing Comparator for a PriorityQueue.

In the context of the `Object.equals` method you referenced, it is comparing `this` with an `Object`: \r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\npublic boolean equals(Object obj) {\r\n    return (this == obj);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPer the [Java Language Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.21.3):\r\n\r\n&gt; It is a compile-time error if it is impossible to convert the type of either operand to the type of the other by a casting conversion ([&#167;5.5](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.5)).

Per the [Javadocs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html#equals(java.lang.Object)) of `Object.equals`, the two objects need only implement an _equivalence relation_:\r\n\r\n&gt; The `equals` method implements an equivalence relation on non-null object references:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; * It is _reflexive_: for any non-null reference value `x`, `x.equals(x)` should return `true`.\r\n&gt; * It is _symmetric_: for any non-null reference values `x` and `y`, `x.equals(y)` should return `true` if and only if `y.equals(x)` returns `true`.\r\n&gt; * It is _transitive_: for any non-null reference values `x`, `y`, and `z`, if `x.equals(y)` returns `true` and `y.equals(z)` returns `true`, then `x.equals(z)` should return `true`.\r\n&gt; * It is _consistent_: for any non-null reference values `x` and `y`, multiple invocations of `x.equals(y)` consistently return `true` or consistently return `false`, provided no information used in `equals` comparisons on the objects is modified.\r\n&gt; * For any non-null reference value `x`, `x.equals(null)` should return `false`.\r\n\r\nTake the Java [`List`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html) interface.

Returns `true` if and only if the specified object is also a list, both lists have the same size, and all corresponding pairs of elements in the two lists are _equal_. (Two elements `e1` and `e2` are _equal_ if `Objects.equals(e1, e2)`.) In other words, two lists are defined to be equal if they contain the same elements in the same order. This definition ensures that the equals method works properly across different implementations of the `List` interface.\r\n\r\nNow, take two lists that can&#39;t be cast to one another, such as [`ArrayList`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html) and [`LinkedList`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/LinkedList.html).  A `LinkedList` reference cannot be compared with an `ArrayList` reference using the reference equality error (`==`), since neither type can be cast to the other.  On the other hand, an `ArrayList` will be `.equals` to a `LinkedList` if they contain the same elements in the same order.\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\nArrayList&lt;String&gt; a = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(Arrays.asList(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;));\r\nLinkedList&lt;String&gt; b = new LinkedList&lt;String&gt;(Arrays.asList(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;));\r\n\r\nassert a.equals(b); // true\r\nassert a == b; // compiler error\r\n```","title":"Why can Object.equals compare types that cannot be compared with the reference equality operator (==)?","body":"<p>The compile time check is performed at the site of the reference equality — within <code>Object.equals</code>.
