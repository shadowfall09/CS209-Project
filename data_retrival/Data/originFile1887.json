The code for the final working service is below. \r\n\r\n    public class BluetoothHDPService extends Service {\r\n        private static final String TAG = &quot;BluetoothHDPService&quot;;\r\n    \r\n        public static final int RESULT_OK = 0;\r\n        public static final int RESULT_FAIL = -1;\r\n    \r\n        // Status codes sent back to the UI client.\r\n        // Application registration complete.\r\n        public static final int STATUS_HEALTH_APP_REG = 100;\r\n        // Application unregistration complete.\r\n        public static final int STATUS_HEALTH_APP_UNREG = 101;\r\n        // Channel creation complete.\r\n        public static final int STATUS_CREATE_CHANNEL = 102;\r\n        // Channel destroy complete.\r\n        public static final int STATUS_DESTROY_CHANNEL = 103;\r\n        // Reading data from Bluetooth HDP device.\r\n        public static final int STATUS_READ_DATA = 104;\r\n        // Done with reading data.\r\n        public static final int STATUS_READ_DATA_DONE = 105;\r\n    \r\n        // Message codes received from the UI client.\r\n        // Register client with this service.\r\n        public static final int MSG_REG_CLIENT = 200;\r\n        // Unregister client from this service.\r\n        public static final int MSG_UNREG_CLIENT = 201;\r\n        // Register health application.\r\n        public static final int MSG_REG_HEALTH_APP = 300;\r\n        // Unregister health application.\r\n        public static final int MSG_UNREG_HEALTH_APP = 301;\r\n        // Connect channel.\r\n        public static final int MSG_CONNECT_CHANNEL = 400;\r\n        // Disconnect channel.\r\n        public static final int MSG_DISCONNECT_CHANNEL = 401;\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic static final int RECEIVED_SYS = 901;\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic static final int RECEIVED_DIA = 902;\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic static final int RECEIVED_PUL = 903;\r\n        \r\n        private int count;\r\n        private byte[] invoke = {0x00, 0x00};\r\n    \r\n        private BluetoothHealthAppConfiguration mHealthAppConfig;\r\n        private BluetoothAdapter mBluetoothAdapter;\r\n        private BluetoothHealth mBluetoothHealth;\r\n        private BluetoothDevice mDevice;\r\n        private int mChannelId;\r\n    \r\n        private Messenger mClient;\r\n    \r\n        // Handles events sent by {@link HealthHDPActivity}.\r\n        @SuppressLint(&quot;HandlerLeak&quot;)\r\n    \tprivate class IncomingHandler extends Handler {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void handleMessage(Message msg) {\r\n                switch (msg.what) {\r\n                    // Register UI client to this service so the client can receive messages.\r\n                    case MSG_REG_CLIENT:\r\n                        Log.d(TAG, &quot;Activity client registered&quot;);\r\n                        mClient = msg.replyTo;\r\n                        break;\r\n                    // Unregister UI client from this service.\r\n                    case MSG_UNREG_CLIENT:\r\n                        mClient = null;\r\n                        break;\r\n                    // Register health application.\r\n                    case MSG_REG_HEALTH_APP:\r\n                        registerApp(msg.arg1);\r\n                        break;\r\n                    // Unregister health application.\r\n                    case MSG_UNREG_HEALTH_APP:\r\n                        unregisterApp();\r\n                        break;\r\n                    // Connect channel.\r\n                    case MSG_CONNECT_CHANNEL:\r\n                        mDevice = (BluetoothDevice) msg.obj;\r\n                        connectChannel();\r\n                        break;\r\n                    // Disconnect channel.\r\n                    case MSG_DISCONNECT_CHANNEL:\r\n                        mDevice = (BluetoothDevice) msg.obj;\r\n                        disconnectChannel();\r\n                        break;\r\n                    default:\r\n                        super.handleMessage(msg);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        final Messenger mMessenger = new Messenger(new IncomingHandler());\r\n    \r\n        /**\r\n         * Make sure Bluetooth and health profile are available on the Android device.

The differences between then is: a component test test more than one class (i.e., its inner objects aren&#39;t all mocked out - but some of them might be [such as JMS publishers]) and an Integration test is a test that nothing at all is mocked out.

I&#39;m already aware of Files.move and such, my problem is that I had a look at at least one implementation for that method and it raised some doubts about if implementations really guarantee atomic moves. Please look at the following code:\r\n\r\n[Files.move on GrepCode for OpenJDK](http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/7u40-b43/java/nio/file/Files.java#Files.move%28java.nio.file.Path%2Cjava.nio.file.Path%2Cjava.nio.file.CopyOption%5B%5D%29)\r\n\r\n    1342        FileSystemProvider provider = provider(source);\r\n    1343        if (provider(target) == provider) {\r\n    1344            // same provider\r\n    1345            provider.move(source, target, options);\r\n    1346        } else {\r\n    1347            // different providers\r\n    1348            CopyMoveHelper.moveToForeignTarget(source, target, options);\r\n    1349        }\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the option ATOMIC_MOVE is not considered in all cases, but the location of the source and target path is the only thing that matters in the first place. That&#39;s not what I want and how I understand the documentation:\r\n\r\n&gt; If the move cannot be performed as an atomic file system operation then\r\n&gt; AtomicMoveNotSupportedException is thrown. This can arise, for example, when the target\r\n&gt; location is on a different FileStore and would require that the file be copied, or target\r\n&gt; location is associated with a different provider to this object.\r\n\r\nThe above code clearly violates that documentation because it falls back to a copy-delete-strategy without recognizing ATOMIC_MOVE at all. An exception would be perfectly OK in my case, because with that a hoster of our service could change his setup to use only one filesystem which supports atomic moves, as that&#39;s what we expect in the system requirements anyway. What I don&#39;t want to deal with is things silently failing just because an implementation uses a copy-delete-strategy which may result in data corruption in the target file. So, from my understanding it is simply not safe to rely on Files.move for atomic operations, because it doesn&#39;t always fail if those are not supported, but implementations may fall back to a copy-delete-strategy.\r\n\r\nIs such behaviour a bug in the implementation and needs to get filed or does the documentation allow such behaviour and I&#39;m understanding it wrong? Does it make any difference at all if I now already know that such maybe broken implementations are used out there? I would need to synchronize the write access on my own in that case...","title":"How to guarantee atomic move or exception of a file in Java?","body":"<p>In one of my projects I have concurrent write access to one single file within one JRE and want to handle that by first writing to a temporary file and afterwards moving that temp file to the target using an atomic move.

Please look at the following code:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/root/jdk/openjdk/7u40-b43/java/nio/file/Files.java#Files.move%28java.nio.file.Path%2Cjava.nio.file.Path%2Cjava.nio.file.CopyOption%5B%5D%29\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Files.move on GrepCode for OpenJDK</a></p>\n\n<pre><code>1342        FileSystemProvider provider = provider(source);\n1343        if (provider(target) == provider) {\n1344            // same provider\n1345            provider.move(source, target, options);\n1346        } else {\n1347            // different providers\n1348            CopyMoveHelper.moveToForeignTarget(source, target, options);\n1349        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is that the option ATOMIC_MOVE is not considered in all cases, but the location of the source and target path is the only thing that matters in the first place. That's not what I want and how I understand the documentation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the move cannot be performed as an atomic file system operation then\n  AtomicMoveNotSupportedException is thrown. This can arise, for example, when the target\n  location is on a different FileStore and would require that the file be copied, or target\n  location is associated with a different provider to this object.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above code clearly violates that documentation because it falls back to a copy-delete-strategy without recognizing ATOMIC_MOVE at all. An exception would be perfectly OK in my case, because with that a hoster of our service could change his setup to use only one filesystem which supports atomic moves, as that's what we expect in the system requirements anyway. What I don't want to deal with is things silently failing just because an implementation uses a copy-delete-strategy which may result in data corruption in the target file. So, from my understanding it is simply not safe to rely on Files.move for atomic operations, because it doesn't always fail if those are not supported, but implementations may fall back to a copy-delete-strategy.</p>\n\n<p>Is such behaviour a bug in the implementation and needs to get filed or does the documentation allow such behaviour and I'm understanding it wrong? Does it make any difference at all if I now already know that such maybe broken implementations are used out there? I would need to synchronize the write access on my own in that case...</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","maven","aem"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2252016,"reputation":6192,"user_id":1984049,"accept_rate":74,"display_name":"Oliver"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1420454009,"creation_date":1420454009,"answer_id":27777679,"question_id":27777100,"body_markdown":"\r\n **I am still not able to download the jar.** I found a work around.\r\n\r\nI downloaded the JAR Manually and installed it in Maven using following command.\r\n\r\n    mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.day.cq.dam -DartifactId=cq-dam-api -Dversion=5.5.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=C:\\Users\\okaunds\\Desktop\\cq-dam-api-5.5.0.jar\r\n\r\nAnd then I ran my install command for CQ project.

That's up to you, but the Gaussian kernel is the only circularly symmetric one that is also separable (if you only look at real-valued kernels) and generally has nice properties, so I would recommend only deviating from it if there is a good reason for it.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway I'll write some example code now, not tested:</p>\n\n<pre><code>BufferedImage transposedHBlur(BufferedImage im) {\n    int height = im.getHeight();\n    int width = im.getWidth();\n    // result is transposed, so the width/height are swapped\n    BufferedImage temp =  new BufferedImage(height, width, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);\n    float[] k = new float[7] { 0.00598, 0.060626, 0.241843, 0.383103, 0.241843, 0.060626, 0.00598 };\n    // horizontal blur, transpose result\n    for (int y = 0; y &lt; height; y++) {\n        for (int x = 3; x &lt; width - 3; x++) {\n            float r = 0, g = 0, b = 0;\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; 7; i++) {\n                int pixel = im.getRGB(x + i - 3, y);\n                b += (pixel &amp; 0xFF) * k[i];\n                g += ((pixel &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xFF) * k[i];\n                r += ((pixel &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xFF) * k[i];\n            }\n            int p = (int)b + ((int)g &lt;&lt; 8) + ((int)r &lt;&lt; 16);\n            // transpose result!\n            temp.setRGB(y, x, p);\n        }\n    }\n    return temp;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since it also transposes, you can simply call it twice and the second time will effectively be a vertical blur that also restores the orientation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>temp = transposedHBlur(input);\nresult = transposedHBlur(temp);\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":10032621,"reputation":653,"user_id":7418534,"display_name":"ErShakirAnsari"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1576651158,"creation_date":1576651158,"answer_id":59386679,"question_id":43743998,"body_markdown":"This is the best article I ever found:\r\n\r\n[Java Image Processing][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.jhlabs.com/ip/blurring.html","title":"How to make smooth blur effect in java?","body":"<p>This is the best article I ever found:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jhlabs.com/ip/blurring.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Java Image Processing</a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":6544304,"reputation":204,"user_id":5060785,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"NEKIBUR RAHMAN"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":4555,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":43754106,"answer_count":3,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1635880339,"creation_date":1493746541,"question_id":43743998,"body_markdown":"I have blured an image.

Just create new thread with runnable made of your <code>QueueListener</code>, mark it as daemon <code>thread.setDaemon(true)</code> and call <code>thread.start()</code>"},{"owner":{"account_id":11497329,"reputation":77,"user_id":8426191,"display_name":"Danny Julian"},"score":0,"creation_date":1635873044,"post_id":69760078,"comment_id":123406867,"body_markdown":"Thank you for the suggestions!!","body":"Thank you for the suggestions!!"},{"owner":{"account_id":2994830,"reputation":1,"user_id":2541560,"display_name":"Kayaman"},"score":0,"creation_date":1635873674,"post_id":69760078,"comment_id":123407133,"body_markdown":"@AlexanderPavlov creating a [ThreadPoolExecutor](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutor.html#ThreadPoolExecutor-int-int-long-java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit-java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue-) with `maximumPoolSize` of `Integer.MAX_VALUE` wouldn&#39;t require you to do that.

For one of the edge directions, you want a vector which is at the same time perpendicular to &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and to the &lt;i&gt;Y&lt;/i&gt; axis. The cross product can be used to obtain a vector which is perpendicular to two given ones. So you compute it like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-none --&gt;\r\n\r\n    [ 0 ]   [ x2 − x1 ]   [ z2 − z1 ]   [  dz ]\r\n    [ 1 ] &#215; [ y2 - y1 ] = [    0    ] = [  0  ] = w₁\r\n    [ 0 ]   [ z2 - z1 ]   [ x1 − x2 ]   [ −dx ]\r\n\r\nFor the second edge direction, you want to be perpendicular to that first one, and also perpendicular to &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; again.
