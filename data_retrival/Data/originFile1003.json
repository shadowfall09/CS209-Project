Is this an appropriate means in which to continue with the implementation, or could you point me in the direction of a more appropriate methodology?</p>\n<p>The rationale for wanting to implement this is along the lines of that I would like be able to get a count of the number of people that fall under each category.</p>\n<p>This is for a personal project to help learn, the idea being it to be a software to get diversity statistics about a group of people.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","hibernate","jpa"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":26301533,"reputation":1119,"user_id":19966820,"display_name":"YJR"},"score":0,"creation_date":1663784218,"post_id":73805135,"comment_id":130323146,"body_markdown":"As far I understood you created a entity not need to implement .That is userRole entity.

How do I stop it from causing this error?\r\n\r\nI am trying to apply GraphQL to a particular data model with a Many to Many mapping.

If I use ```@SchemaMapping``` rather than ```@BatchMapping``` I do not get this error, but this is a large dataset so that is inefficient.: \r\n```\r\n@Controller\r\npublic class GraphQLController

Shared references to a collection while using GraphQL BatchMapping","body":"<p>My research suggests that this error occurs when something like item1.setOptions(item2.getOptions()) occurs. Solutions generally suggest searching for and removing anything like that. I am never calling Item.setOptions anywhere in my own code, so it seems to me that whatever is causing this must be within Spring GraphQL or JPA code or somewhere else. How do I stop it from causing this error?</p>\n<p>I am trying to apply GraphQL to a particular data model with a Many to Many mapping. I have two classes, simplified below:</p>\n<pre><code>@Entity\n@Data\n@NoArgsConstructor\n@Table(name=&quot;items_table&quot;)\npublic class Item implements Serializable {\n\n    private static final long serialVersionUID = -2084220931830648548L;\n\n    @Id\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    String id;\n\n    @Basic(optional = false)\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    String type;\n\n    @ManyToMany\n    @JoinTable(name=&quot;options_table&quot;,\n    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name=&quot;type&quot;, referencedColumnName=&quot;type&quot;),\n    inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name=&quot;id&quot;, referencedColumnName=&quot;id&quot;))\n    List&lt;Option&gt; options;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>@Entity\n@Data\n@NoArgsConstructor\n@Table(name=&quot;options_table&quot;)\npublic class Option implements Serializable {\n\n    private static final long serialVersionUID = 7050760122397397513L;\n\n    @Id\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    Long id;\n\n    @Basic(optional = false)\n    @Column(nullable = false)\n    String type;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The GraphQL Schema, again simplified:</p>\n<pre><code>type Query {\n    items: [Item]\n}\n\ntype Item{\n    id : Int\n    type: String\n    options: [Option]\n}\n\ntype Option {\n    id : Int\n    type: String\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The Controller class and Service. If I use <code>@SchemaMapping</code> rather than <code>@BatchMapping</code> I do not get this error, but this is a large dataset so that is inefficient.:</p>\n<pre><code>@Controller\npublic class GraphQLController {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private GraphQLService graphqlService;\n\n    @QueryMapping\n    List&lt;Item&gt; items()\n    {\n        return graphqlService.getItems();\n    }\n\n    @BatchMapping\n    Map&lt;Item, List&lt;Option&gt;&gt; options(List&lt;Item&gt; items) {\n        return graphqlService.getOptionsByTypes(items);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>@Service\npublic class GraphService {\n\n    @Autowired private ItemRepository itemRepo;\n    @Autowired private OptionRepository optionRepo;\n\n    public GraphService() {\n        super();\n    }\n\n    @Transactional(noRollbackFor=Exception.class)\n    public List&lt;Item&gt; getItems() {\n        return StreamSupport.stream(itemRepo.findAll().spliterator(), false).toList();\n    }\n\n    @Transactional(readOnly=true, noRollbackFor=Exception.class)\n    public Map&lt;Item, List&lt;Option&gt;&gt; getOptionsByTypes(List&lt;Item&gt; items) {\n        List&lt;String&gt; types = items.stream().map(Item::getType).collect(Collectors.toList());\n\n        Map&lt;String, List&lt;Option&gt;&gt; optionsByType= StreamSupport.stream(optionRepo.findByTypeIn(types).spliterator(), false).collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Option::getType));\n        Map&lt;Item, List&lt;Option&gt;&gt; itemOptionsMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n        for (Item item : items) {\n

In fact the chances of you actually correctly interpreting whatever numbers you get is extremely low.  (Pretty much every time I look at memory usage numbers with other engineers, there is always a long discussion about what they actually mean that only results in a vague conclusion.)\r\n\r\n**Note: we now have much more extensive documentation on [Managing Your App&#39;s Memory](http://developer.android.com/training/articles/memory.html) that covers much of the material here and is more up-to-date with the state of Android.**\r\n\r\nFirst thing is to probably read the last part of this article which has some discussion of how memory is managed on Android:\r\n\r\n[Service API changes starting with Android 2.0](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/02/service-api-changes-starting-with.html)\r\n\r\nNow `ActivityManager.getMemoryInfo()` is our highest-level API for looking at overall memory usage.  This is mostly there to help an application gauge how close the system is coming to having no more memory for background processes, thus needing to start killing needed processes like services.  For pure Java applications, this should be of little use, since the Java heap limit is there in part to avoid one app from being able to stress the system to this point.\r\n\r\nGoing lower-level, you can use the Debug API to get raw kernel-level information about memory usage: [android.os.Debug.MemoryInfo](http://developer.android.com/intl/de/reference/android/os/Debug.html#getMemoryInfo)\r\n\r\nNote starting with 2.0 there is also an API, `ActivityManager.getProcessMemoryInfo`, to get this information about another process: [ActivityManager.getProcessMemoryInfo(int[])](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.html#getProcessMemoryInfo(int[]))\r\n\r\nThis returns a low-level MemoryInfo structure with all of this data:\r\n\r\n        /** The proportional set size for dalvik. */\r\n        public int dalvikPss;\r\n        /** The private dirty pages used by dalvik. */\r\n        public int dalvikPrivateDirty;\r\n        /** The shared dirty pages used by dalvik. */\r\n        public int dalvikSharedDirty;\r\n\r\n        /** The proportional set size for the native heap. */\r\n        public int nativePss;\r\n        /** The private dirty pages used by the native heap. */\r\n        public int nativePrivateDirty;\r\n        /** The shared dirty pages used by the native heap. */\r\n        public int nativeSharedDirty;\r\n\r\n        /** The proportional set size for everything else. */\r\n        public int otherPss;\r\n        /** The private dirty pages used by everything else. */\r\n        public int otherPrivateDirty;\r\n        /** The shared dirty pages used by everything else. */\r\n        public int otherSharedDirty;\r\n\r\nBut as to what the difference is between `Pss`, `PrivateDirty`, and `SharedDirty`...  well now the fun begins.\r\n\r\nA lot of memory in Android (and Linux systems in general) is actually shared across multiple processes.  So how much memory a processes uses is really not clear.  Add on top of that paging out to disk (let alone swap which we don&#39;t use on Android) and it is even less clear.\r\n\r\nThus if you were to take all of the physical RAM actually mapped in to each process, and add up all of the processes, you would probably end up with a number much greater than the actual total RAM.\r\n\r\nThe `Pss` number is a metric the kernel computes that takes into account memory sharing -- basically each page of RAM in a process is scaled by a ratio of the number of other processes also using that page.  This way you can (in theory) add up the pss across all processes to see the total RAM they are using, and compare pss between processes to get a rough idea of their relative weight.\r\n\r\nThe other interesting metric here is `PrivateDirty`, which is basically the amount of RAM inside the process that can not be paged to disk (it is not backed by the same data on disk), and is not shared with any other processes.  Another way to look at this is the RAM that will become available to the system when that process goes away (and probably quickly subsumed into caches and other uses of it).\r\n\r\nThat is pretty much the SDK APIs for this.  However there is more you can do as a developer with your device.\r\n\r\nUsing `adb`, there is a lot of information you can get about the memory use of a running system.  A common one is the command `adb shell dumpsys meminfo` which will spit out a bunch of information about the memory use of each Java process, containing the above info as well as a variety of other things.  You can also tack on the name or pid of a single process to see, for example `adb shell dumpsys meminfo system` give me the system process:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n** MEMINFO in pid 890 [system] **\r\n                    native   dalvik    other    total\r\n            size:    10940     7047      N/A    17987\r\n       allocated:     8943     5516      N/A    14459\r\n            free:      336     1531      N/A     1867\r\n           (Pss):     4585     9282    11916    25783\r\n  (shared dirty):     2184     3596      916     6696\r\n    (priv dirty):     4504     5956     7456    17916\r\n \r\n Objects\r\n           Views:      149        ViewRoots:        4\r\n     AppContexts:       13       Activities:        0\r\n          Assets:        4    AssetManagers:        4\r\n   Local Binders:      141    Proxy Binders:      158\r\nDeath Recipients:       49\r\n OpenSSL Sockets:        0\r\n \r\n SQL\r\n            heap:      205          dbFiles:        0\r\n       numPagers:        0   inactivePageKB:        0\r\n    activePageKB:        0\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nThe top section is the main one, where `size` is the total size in address space of a particular heap, `allocated` is the kb of actual allocations that heap thinks it has, `free` is the remaining kb free the heap has for additional allocations, and `pss` and `priv dirty` are the same as discussed before specific to pages associated with each of the heaps.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to look at memory usage across all processes, you can use the command `adb shell procrank`.  Output of this on the same system looks like:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n  PID      Vss      Rss      Pss      Uss  cmdline\r\n  890   84456K   48668K   25850K   21284K  system_server\r\n 1231   50748K   39088K   17587K   13792K  com.android.launcher2\r\n  947   34488K   28528K   10834K    9308K  com.android.wallpaper\r\n  987   26964K   26956K    8751K    7308K  com.google.process.gapps\r\n  954   24300K   24296K    6249K    4824K  com.android.phone\r\n  948   23020K   23016K    5864K    4748K  com.android.inputmethod.latin\r\n  888   25728K   25724K    5774K    3668K  zygote\r\n  977   24100K   24096K    5667K    4340K  android.process.acore\r\n...\r\n   59     336K     332K      99K      92K  /system/bin/installd\r\n   60     396K     392K      93K      84K  /system/bin/keystore\r\n   51     280K     276K      74K      68K  /system/bin/servicemanager\r\n   54     256K     252K      69K      64K  /system/bin/debuggerd\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nHere the `Vss` and `Rss` columns are basically noise (these are the straight-forward address space and RAM usage of a process, where if you add up the RAM usage across processes you get an ridiculously large number).\r\n\r\n`Pss` is as we&#39;ve seen before, and `Uss` is `Priv Dirty`.\r\n\r\nInteresting thing to note here: `Pss` and `Uss` are slightly (or more than slightly) different than what we saw in `meminfo`.  Why is that?  Well procrank uses a different kernel mechanism to collect its data than `meminfo` does, and they give slightly different results.  Why is that?  Honestly I haven&#39;t a clue.  I believe `procrank` may be the more accurate one...  but really, this just leave the point: &quot;take any memory info you get with a grain of salt; often a very large grain.&quot;\r\n\r\nFinally there is the command `adb shell cat /proc/meminfo` that gives a summary of the overall memory usage of the system.  There is a lot of data here, only the first few numbers worth discussing (and the remaining ones understood by few people, and my questions of those few people about them often resulting in conflicting explanations):\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nMemTotal:         395144 kB\r\nMemFree:          184936 kB\r\nBuffers:             880 kB\r\nCached:            84104 kB\r\nSwapCached:            0 kB\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n`MemTotal` is the total amount of memory available to the kernel and user space (often less than the actual physical RAM of the device, since some of that RAM is needed for the radio, DMA buffers, etc).\r\n\r\n`MemFree` is the amount of RAM that is not being used at all.  The number you see here is very high; typically on an Android system this would be only a few MB, since we try to use available memory to keep processes running\r\n\r\n`Cached` is the RAM being used for filesystem caches and other such things.  Typical systems will need to have 20MB or so for this to avoid getting into bad paging states; the Android out of memory killer is tuned for a particular system to make sure that background processes are killed before the cached RAM is consumed too much by them to result in such paging.","title":"How do I discover memory usage of my application in Android?","body":"<p>Note that memory usage on modern operating systems like Linux is an <em>extremely</em> complicated and difficult to understand area.

Output of this on the same system looks like:</p>\n\n<pre>\n  PID      Vss      Rss      Pss      Uss  cmdline\n  890   84456K   48668K   25850K   21284K  system_server\n 1231   50748K   39088K   17587K   13792K  com.android.launcher2\n  947   34488K   28528K   10834K    9308K  com.android.wallpaper\n  987   26964K   26956K    8751K    7308K  com.google.process.gapps\n  954   24300K   24296K    6249K    4824K  com.android.phone\n  948   23020K   23016K    5864K    4748K  com.android.inputmethod.latin\n  888   25728K   25724K    5774K    3668K  zygote\n  977   24100K   24096K    5667K    4340K  android.process.acore\n...\n   59     336K     332K      99K      92K  /system/bin/installd\n   60     396K     392K      93K      84K  /system/bin/keystore\n   51     280K     276K      74K      68K  /system/bin/servicemanager\n   54     256K     252K      69K      64K  /system/bin/debuggerd\n</pre>\n\n<p>Here the <code>Vss</code> and <code>Rss</code> columns are basically noise (these are the straight-forward address space and RAM usage of a process, where if you add up the RAM usage across processes you get an ridiculously large number).</p>\n\n<p><code>Pss</code> is as we've seen before, and <code>Uss</code> is <code>Priv Dirty</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Interesting thing to note here: <code>Pss</code> and <code>Uss</code> are slightly (or more than slightly) different than what we saw in <code>meminfo</code>.  Why is that?  Well procrank uses a different kernel mechanism to collect its data than <code>meminfo</code> does, and they give slightly different results.  Why is that?  Honestly I haven't a clue.  I believe <code>procrank</code> may be the more accurate one...  but really, this just leave the point: \"take any memory info you get with a grain of salt; often a very large grain.\"</p>\n\n<p>Finally there is the command <code>adb shell cat /proc/meminfo</code> that gives a summary of the overall memory usage of the system.  There is a lot of data here, only the first few numbers worth discussing (and the remaining ones understood by few people, and my questions of those few people about them often resulting in conflicting explanations):</p>\n\n<pre>\nMemTotal:         395144 kB\nMemFree:          184936 kB\nBuffers:             880 kB\nCached:            84104 kB\nSwapCached:            0 kB\n</pre>\n\n<p><code>MemTotal</code> is the total amount of memory available to the kernel and user space (often less than the actual physical RAM of the device, since some of that RAM is needed for the radio, DMA buffers, etc).</p>\n\n<p><code>MemFree</code> is the amount of RAM that is not being used at all.  The number you see here is very high; typically on an Android system this would be only a few MB, since we try to use available memory to keep processes running</p>\n\n<p><code>Cached</code> is the RAM being used for filesystem caches and other such things.  Typical systems will need to have 20MB or so for this to avoid getting into bad paging states; the Android out of memory killer is tuned for a particular system to make sure that background processes are killed before the cached RAM is consumed too much by them to result in such paging.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":130663,"reputation":635,"user_id":330086,"display_name":"Ryan Beesley"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":52,"is_accepted":false,"score":52,"last_activity_date":1281724353,"creation_date":1281724353,"answer_id":3479710,"question_id":2298208,"body_markdown":"This is a work in progress, but this is what I don&#39;t understand:\r\n\r\n    ActivityManager activityManager = (ActivityManager) context.getSystemService(ACTIVITY_SERVICE);\r\n    MemoryInfo memoryInfo = new ActivityManager.MemoryInfo();\r\n    activityManager.getMemoryInfo(memoryInfo);\r\n    \r\n    Log.i(TAG, &quot; memoryInfo.availMem &quot; + memoryInfo.availMem + &quot;\\n&quot; );\r\n    Log.i(TAG, &quot; memoryInfo.lowMemory &quot; + memoryInfo.lowMemory + &quot;\\n&quot; );\r\n    Log.i(TAG, &quot; memoryInfo.threshold &quot; + memoryInfo.threshold + &quot;\\n&quot; );\r\n    \r\n    List&lt;RunningAppProcessInfo&gt; runningAppProcesses = activityManager.getRunningAppProcesses();\r\n    \r\n    Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; pidMap = new TreeMap&lt;Integer, String&gt;();\r\n    for (RunningAppProcessInfo runningAppProcessInfo : runningAppProcesses)\r\n    {\r\n    \tpidMap.put(runningAppProcessInfo.pid, runningAppProcessInfo.processName);\r\n    }\r\n            \r\n    Collection&lt;Integer&gt; keys = pidMap.keySet();\r\n    \r\n    for(int key : keys)\r\n    {\r\n    \tint pids[] = new int[1];\r\n    \tpids[0] = key;\r\n    \tandroid.os.Debug.MemoryInfo[] memoryInfoArray = activityManager.getProcessMemoryInfo(pids);\r\n    \tfor(android.os.Debug.MemoryInfo pidMemoryInfo: memoryInfoArray)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tLog.i(TAG, String.format(&quot;** MEMINFO in pid %d [%s] **\\n&quot;,pids[0],pidMap.get(pids[0])));\r\n    \t\tLog.i(TAG, &quot; pidMemoryInfo.getTotalPrivateDirty(): &quot; + pidMemoryInfo.getTotalPrivateDirty() + &quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n    \t\tLog.i(TAG, &quot; pidMemoryInfo.getTotalPss(): &quot; + pidMemoryInfo.getTotalPss() + &quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n    \t\tLog.i(TAG, &quot; pidMemoryInfo.getTotalSharedDirty(): &quot; + pidMemoryInfo.getTotalSharedDirty() + &quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhy isn&#39;t the PID mapped to the result in activityManager.getProcessMemoryInfo()?

Could anyone help me with this?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","amazon-s3","apache-kafka","apache-flink"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":5767825,"reputation":445,"user_id":4552188,"display_name":"Dimitrios"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1664366472,"creation_date":1664366472,"answer_id":73881050,"question_id":73828014,"body_markdown":"Setting \r\n```\r\nfs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider:com.amazonaws.auth.profile.ProfileCredentialsProvider\r\n```\r\nin the job manager properties, alongside the environment variable `AWS_PROFILES` to a valid AWS profile (such as `/.aws/config`) fixes the issue.\r\n\r\nMake sure that you&#39;re refreshing your tokens. \r\n\r\nMore on: https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-aws/tools/hadoop-aws/index.html","title":"Flink StreamingFileSink to Amazon S3 with flink-s3-fs-hadoop token expired exception","body":"<p>Setting</p>\n<pre><code>fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider:com.amazonaws.auth.profile.ProfileCredentialsProvider\n</code></pre>\n<p>in the job manager properties, alongside the environment variable <code>AWS_PROFILES</code> to a valid AWS profile (such as <code>/.aws/config</code>) fixes the issue.</p>\n<p>Make sure that you're refreshing your tokens.</p>\n<p>More on: <a href=\"https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-aws/tools/hadoop-aws/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-aws/tools/hadoop-aws/index.html</a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":5767825,"reputation":445,"user_id":4552188,"display_name":"Dimitrios"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":627,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":73881050,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1664366472,"creation_date":1663937493,"question_id":73828014,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to stream some data from kafka into s3 (using s3a protocol).\r\n\r\nThe pipeline works good for an hour, but after an hour (same as my token expiry setting for AWS), throws a (from the StreamingFileSink):\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.AmazonS3Exception: The provided token has expired.

Any thoughts on being able to dynamically append the passed request parameters to my query and fetching only relevant fields?\r\n\r\nShould I create separate entities so that I get only those fields from my repository and then a new specification for each of those each time? Won&#39;t this create too many unnecessary entities and specification files?\r\n\r\nThe other way I can think of is that, I&#39;ll have to manually extract those columns. This would sound stupid as I already know that I need to do a &#39;`select column1, column2, column3 from db where condition1 = true and condition2= true&#39;` but I&#39;m still doing a `select *`.\r\n\r\nCan anyone please guide on what&#39;s the best approach to take in this case?
