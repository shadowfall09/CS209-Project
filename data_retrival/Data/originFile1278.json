This is strongly discouraged. By default, a new controller instance is created every time the FXML file is loaded. Consequently, it quickly becomes difficult to reason about which fields should have been injected (i.e., non-null) at any given time. An FXML file should have a _one-to-one_ mapping with an FXML controller class (or possibly no controller).\r\n\r\nYou have two views, which suggests two FXML files and thus two FXML controller classes. When you load the second view, you should communicate to its controller the needed information. For trivial applications you can do this directly, but for more complex applications it would be better to communicate via a model shared between the two controllers.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example (based on your code but simplified for demonstration). It only asks for the upper bounds of the X and Y axes and then graphs random data within those bounds.

This is strongly discouraged. By default, a new controller instance is created every time the FXML file is loaded. Consequently, it quickly becomes difficult to reason about which fields should have been injected (i.e., non-null) at any given time. An FXML file should have a <em>one-to-one</em> mapping with an FXML controller class (or possibly no controller).</p>\n<p>You have two views, which suggests two FXML files and thus two FXML controller classes. When you load the second view, you should communicate to its controller the needed information. For trivial applications you can do this directly, but for more complex applications it would be better to communicate via a model shared between the two controllers.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p>Here's an example (based on your code but simplified for demonstration). It only asks for the upper bounds of the X and Y axes and then graphs random data within those bounds. It also makes use of <code>TextFormatter</code> to make it easier to grab the values out of the <code>TextField</code>s, and to ensure the user only enters positive integers.</p>\n<p>FXML files are assumed to be located in the <code>com.example</code> package.</p>\n<p><strong>Main.java</strong>:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>package com.example;\n\nimport javafx.application.Application;\nimport javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader;\nimport javafx.scene.Parent;\nimport javafx.scene.Scene;\nimport javafx.stage.Stage;\n\npublic class Main extends Application {\n\n  @Override\n  public void start(Stage primaryStage) throws Exception {\n    var root = FXMLLoader.&lt;Parent&gt;load(Main.class.getResource(&quot;Form.fxml&quot;));\n    primaryStage.setScene(new Scene(root, 1000, 650));\n    primaryStage.show();\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Form.fxml</strong>:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

This can&#39;t be derived mathematically, because it depends on the way a program uses a HashMap, the program&#39;s input, and so forth.

A HashMap also won&#39;t have a load of less than 0.375, because it won&#39;t be resized until its load reaches 0.75, and resizing halves the load. So maybe the average load is midway between 0.375 and 0.75, which is 0.5625. \r\n\r\nOne could do some math to figure this out, but it was easier for me to write a program to populate HashMaps of sizes between 1 and N and compute the average load over all those cases. If N is about 0.75 of a power of two (say, 768) then the average load is indeed quite close to 0.5625. However, this varies a lot depending on one&#39;s choice of N. If a chosen N is midway between 0.75 of successive powers of two (say, 576) then the average load is only 0.507. So the average load of HashMaps with up to N mappings varies between about 0.507 and 0.5625, depending on one&#39;s choice of N. (This is the &quot;resizing granularity&quot; variance mentioned in the comment.)\r\n\r\nRecall that we assumed that HashMap sizes are uniformly distributed. It&#39;s probably not true, but what is the actual distribution? I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;d guess that there is exponential falloff as the sizes get larger. If so, this would skew the distribution of sizes towards smaller numbers, reducing the average load to be closer to 0.507 than 0.5625. I&#39;d also guess that a lot of people create HashMaps with the default capacity (16) and populate them with six or fewer mappings. That would pull the average down farther.\r\n\r\nIn summary, our model is telling us that the average load is somewhere between 0.507 and 0.5625. Some educated guesses tell us that sizes are skewed smaller, so the average load is also smaller. The choice of 0.5 therefore seems reasonable.\r\n\r\nBut we really don&#39;t need a precise answer for the analysis of when treeify HashMap buckets.

This is likely not a problem for the `containsURL(...)` method. Given what it does, it has no reason to be `synchronized` (neither it, nor the `urlsMatch(...)` method, rely on any external state). The problem is with how the `isLinkURLValid(...)` method passes both `linksCrawled` and `linksInProgress` to the `containsURL(...)` method.\r\n\r\nThese list variables are static, and thus the same instances are passed to the `isLinkURLValid(...)` method on different threads. This would be okay, if all you did was stream the elements of these lists (i.e., only _read_ from the lists). However, elsewhere in your code you also _add elements_ to these lists (i.e., you _write_ to the lists). These writes are performed in `synchronized` methods, but that doesn&#39;t matter because you&#39;re reading the lists without synchronizing on the same object. So, your code is vulnerable to `ConcurrentModificationException`s (you cannot modify a non-concurrent collection while iterating over it).\r\n\r\n_I believe_ the solution would be to simply make the `isLinkURLValid(...)` method `synchronized`, but I&#39;m not 100% positive as I haven&#39;t tested it.","title":"ForkPoolTask.join() ConcurrentModificationException","body":"<p>The problem, I believe, is in your <code>SpiderUtils</code> class.

This is likely not a problem for the <code>containsURL(...)</code> method. Given what it does, it has no reason to be <code>synchronized</code> (neither it, nor the <code>urlsMatch(...)</code> method, rely on any external state). The problem is with how the <code>isLinkURLValid(...)</code> method passes both <code>linksCrawled</code> and <code>linksInProgress</code> to the <code>containsURL(...)</code> method.</p>\n<p>These list variables are static, and thus the same instances are passed to the <code>isLinkURLValid(...)</code> method on different threads. This would be okay, if all you did was stream the elements of these lists (i.e., only <em>read</em> from the lists). However, elsewhere in your code you also <em>add elements</em> to these lists (i.e., you <em>write</em> to the lists). These writes are performed in <code>synchronized</code> methods, but that doesn't matter because you're reading the lists without synchronizing on the same object.

Even if they are dynamic (have VTL code), then you can use #parse instead of #include and still get better performance than a macro.   I wouldn't even be surprised to learn that #define VTL blocks are faster than macros, though i haven't tested that.  Macros are great and very useful, but people do sometimes misuse or abuse them.</p>\n\n<p>The downside of #parse and #include is that you have to maintain more separate files, but that's the price for superior speed.  #define is great for code blocks that don't need args and/or need to be passed around as a reference, but you should only use #define'd blocks directly in the template that defines them or things can get confusing.</p>\n\n<p>Macros are great in that they take params and can be defined globally, and globally is where they perform best and make most sense.
