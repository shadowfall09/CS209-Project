That means, one field may have multiple components. All these components _combine_ represent final value. This should not be related to array in programming language terms I think. The example here is Person Name. Entire Person Name is single data which is split in family name, given name etc. As you can see, this is not an array. This is not multiple values; this is single value split in multiple sub values. So instead of array, you can think this as `class` or `struct` as in [Composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition).\r\n- The **`&amp;`** is sub-component which is similar to component as stated above with the difference that, it further splits data in given component in sub-components. Again, I think this should be linked with language specific `class` or `struct` instead of an array.\r\n\r\nAlso, the characters listed above are default and most commonly used for the purpose stated.

The way I have this written, my if statement is checking to see whether that row contains any matching country name in the Country column, but once it finds it, it just keeps going and doesn&#39;t stop because I haven&#39;t told it to do so. It would find Germany but then move on to the next rows and bypass it until the end of the file, where it will return &quot;not found.&quot; In order for me to fix this, I need to have a return statement following the exportValues = record.get line instead of the end of my method, OR simply type in a line that says &quot;break;&quot; after the money line, which will end the loop and then go to the return statement at the bottom.","title":"How do I print out information with CSV spreadsheet?","body":"<p>I'm currently working on a project with CSV.

However, I can't find the problem probably due to a lack of domain knowledge, so I hope someone can inform me or give me a hint.</p>\n<pre><code>public void tester(){\n    FileResource fr = new FileResource();\n    CSVParser parser = fr.getCSVParser();\n    \n    String GermanyInfo = countryInfo(parser,&quot;Peru&quot;);\n    System.out.println(GermanyInfo);\n}\n\npublic String countryInfo(CSVParser parser, String country){\n    String countryInfo = &quot; &quot;;\n    for (CSVRecord record : parser){\n        String nation = record.get(&quot;Country&quot;);\n        if (nation.contains(country)){\n            String countryExport = record.get(&quot;Exports&quot;);\n            String exportValue = record.get(&quot;Value (dollars)&quot;);\n            countryInfo = country + &quot;: &quot; + countryExport + &quot; &quot; + exportValue;\n        }else{\n        countryInfo = &quot;NOT FOUND&quot;;\n        }\n    }\n    return countryInfo;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Debug Process:\nHey guys, after more testing and trying, I found out the problem is really part of the if statement. My for-each loop is running through the parser, one row at a time. The way I have this written, my if statement is checking to see whether that row contains any matching country name in the Country column, but once it finds it, it just keeps going and doesn't stop because I haven't told it to do so. It would find Germany but then move on to the next rows and bypass it until the end of the file, where it will return &quot;not found.&quot; In order for me to fix this, I need to have a return statement following the exportValues = record.get line instead of the end of my method, OR simply type in a line that says &quot;break;&quot; after the money line, which will end the loop and then go to the return statement at the bottom.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","cassandra","cassandra-3.0","datastax-java-driver"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1553289,"reputation":854,"user_id":1445182,"display_name":"fromanator"},"score":0,"creation_date":1498688452,"post_id":44786410,"comment_id":76607549,"body_markdown":"What version of the java-driver are you using?

If a double quote occurs within a field, then the field has to be surrounded by double quotes and the double quote within the field has to be escaped by another double quote.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a kickoff example:\r\n\r\n    public static &lt;T&gt; void writeCsv (List&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt; csv, char separator, OutputStream output) throws IOException {\r\n        BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(output, &quot;UTF-8&quot;));\r\n        for (List&lt;T&gt; row : csv) {\r\n            for (Iterator&lt;T&gt; iter = row.iterator(); iter.hasNext();) {\r\n                String field = String.valueOf(iter.next()).replace(&quot;\\&quot;&quot;, &quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;&quot;);\r\n                if (field.indexOf(separator) &gt; -1 || field.indexOf(&#39;&quot;&#39;) &gt; -1) {\r\n                    field = &#39;&quot;&#39; + field + &#39;&quot;&#39;;\r\n                }\r\n                writer.append(field);\r\n                if (iter.hasNext()) {\r\n                    writer.append(separator);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            writer.newLine();\r\n        }\r\n        writer.flush();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example how you could use it:\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\r\n        List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; csv = new ArrayList&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt;();\r\n        csv.add(Arrays.asList(&quot;field1&quot;, &quot;field2&quot;, &quot;field3&quot;));\r\n        csv.add(Arrays.asList(&quot;field1,&quot;, &quot;field2&quot;, &quot;fie\\&quot;ld3&quot;));\r\n        csv.add(Arrays.asList(&quot;\\&quot;field1\\&quot;&quot;, &quot;,field2,&quot;, &quot;,\\&quot;,\\&quot;,\\&quot;&quot;));\r\n        writeCsv(csv, &#39;,&#39;, System.out);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd inside a Servlet (yes, Servlet, don&#39;t use JSP for this!) you can basically do:\r\n\r\n    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\r\n        String filename = request.getPathInfo().substring(1);\r\n        List&lt;List&lt;Object&gt;&gt; csv = someDAO().findCsvContentFor(filename);\r\n        response.setHeader(&quot;content-type&quot;, &quot;text/csv&quot;);\r\n        response.setHeader(&quot;content-disposition&quot;, &quot;attachment;filename=\\&quot;&quot; + filename + &quot;\\&quot;&quot;);\r\n        writeCsv(csv, &#39;;&#39;, response.getOutputStream());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMap this servlet on something like `/csv/*` and invoke it as something like `http://example.com/context/csv/filename.csv`. That&#39;s all.\r\n\r\nNote that I added the possiblity to specify the separator character separately, because it may depend on the locale used whether Excel would accept a comma `,` or semicolon `;` as CSV field separator. Note that I also added the filename to the URL pathinfo, because a certain webbrowser developed by a team in Redmond otherwise wouldn&#39;t save the download with the proper filename.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"JSP generating Excel spreadsheet (XLS) to download","body":"<p>Don't use plain HTML tables with an <code>application/vnd.ms-excel</code> content type.

You can add a function to `Feature` called `matchesPredicate` and implement it differently for `NPC` and `Settlement`.

The wrapped `TableCellRenderer` must return a `JComponent` in order to set its foreground property, which should be the color of the text. For example `TableCellRenderer`s which return `JLabel`s are supported (such as `DefaultTableCellRenderer`s). This seems to be the case though, if pre-installed or default renderers are used.\r\n2. The `RowSorter` of the table must be of type `DefaultRowSorter` (such as a `TableRowSorter`) in order to determine if the column is sorted and what is its sort order. That&#39;s because the `RowSorter` class does not make any guarantees as far as I checked for the order of `SortKey`s returned by its `getSortKeys` method. On the other hand `DefaultRowSorter` guarantees that &quot;*Sorting is done based on the current SortKeys, **in order***&quot; (I am assuming the order in which the `SortKey`s are returned by the method `getSortKeys` is implied here). By default the `JTable` though seems to create a `DefaultRowSorter` already.\r\n","title":"Hide sort arrow after change header label","body":"<p>This can be done by implementing a custom <code>TableCellRenderer</code>.

Shortly what `opaque` property does - it affects the way Swing repaints the specific UI element (panel/label/button/etc) whenever a visual update for that element is required. \r\n\r\nFor example when you hover a button with the mouse - it might need to repaint if it has a different hover state, whether it&#39;s just an icon or a slightly/completely different style. This is where opacity comes into play - `opaque=true` components will never pass repaint calls &quot;under&quot; themselves (in other/proper terms - to their parent components). That means that if you have an opaque button on a panel and it have to be repainted when it changes to &quot;hover&quot; state - that button will be the only component to get repainted as there is no reason to repaint anything below it because it is opaque, you literally should not be able to see through it, so the graphics are expected to fill all pixels within bounds of that button with opaque colors. \r\n\r\nTheoretically. On practice if you set a button to an opaque state, but keep it&#39;s graphics content transparent or semi-transparent (which is obviously a mistake, but Swing will never tell you about it) - you will end up seeing various visual artifacts like the ones you see in your application. That happens due to `Graphics2D` implementation often performing different paint operations at (0,0) coordinate to optimize their speed - this is not really important to know, but that is partially why you might see other component &quot;parts&quot; mixed in your component bounds when it is transparent. It&#39;s a bit more complicated than that, but it shouldn&#39;t ever really matter as it is simply an internal Swing optimization.\r\n\r\nSimilar visual problems might also be caused by mixing `opaque=true` and `opaque=false` components on the same layout. Most probably that is the case for your issue as well. I did quickly try to set everything in your demo to `opaque=false` and it did fix the issue, but it&#39;s not really the correct way to fix it, especially if you want to keep some components opaque. That just means the problem lies somewhere in the way of mixing components with different opacity types on top of each other within a single container.\r\n\r\nMy personal recommendation - never mix opaque and non-opaque components in one layout if there is even a slight chance they will overlap (meaning their bounds will intersect within the layout). Or even better - never overlap components on top of each other within a single container. Use multiple nested containers with appropriate non-null layouts, this will also help you a lot in the future to easily modify your UI.\r\n\r\nI can give you a simple example that can demonstrate why it is bad:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n/**\r\n * @author Mikle Garin\r\n */\r\npublic class OpacityGlitch\r\n{\r\n    public static void main ( String[] args )\r\n    {\r\n        SwingUtilities.invokeLater ( () -&gt; {\r\n            final JFrame frame = new JFrame ( &quot;Opacity glitch sample&quot; );\r\n\r\n            // Opaque by default\r\n            final JPanel panel = new JPanel ( null );\r\n\r\n            // Opaque by default, but might vary with L&amp;F\r\n            final JButton button1 = new JButton ( &quot;1111111&quot; );\r\n            panel.add ( button1 );\r\n\r\n            // Non-opaque to demonstrate the problem\r\n            final JButton button2 = new JButton ( &quot;2222222&quot; );\r\n            panel.add ( button2 );\r\n\r\n            // Intersecting buttons\r\n            button1.setBounds ( 100, 100, 150, 30 );\r\n            button2.setBounds ( 130, 115, 150, 30 );\r\n\r\n            frame.getContentPane ().add ( panel );\r\n\r\n            frame.setDefaultCloseOperation ( JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE );\r\n            frame.setSize ( 500, 500 );\r\n            frame.setLocationRelativeTo ( null );\r\n            frame.setVisible ( true );\r\n        } );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTheoretically what you should get is `button1` always being on top (due to it being added earlier and being painted last on the container), but on practice - which button is fully visible and on top of the other one will change if you try hovering either of the buttons. This happens due to both buttons being opaque and repaint calls not going past the button components to their container and whatever intersects with them further on. To fix this particular case it is enough to make `button2` non-opaque because it should always stay below the `button1` and if it is non-opaque it will safely pass the repaint calls at least to it&#39;s container:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbutton2.setOpaque ( false );\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough I personally would recommend making all involved components opaque in such cases to avoid other possible issues if component order may be changed in the future or due to any user interactions - for instance the scroll bar in your application is the prime example. Container does not have to be non-opaque though as it will correctly pass repaint calls between components placed in it and will correctly repaint itself as well.\r\n\r\nOnce you change buttons from my example above to non-opaque the issue will disappear due to repaint being correctly handled for them.\r\n\r\nThis might be a complicated topic for a beginner in Swing, but I highly recommend to fully understand why and how things like that happen, otherwise it will become a huge problem for you in the future, once your application grows bigger.","title":"Why is a transparent JButton showing images of the frame when transparency is added?","body":"<p>Any issues like the one you are seeing in the example app you have posted in 99% of cases happen due to incorrect mixing of opaque and/or non-opaque components. </p>\n\n<p>As I can see from the code - you are using <code>setOpaque(...)</code> to change opacity of various components, but it's quite chaotic. Shortly what <code>opaque</code> property does - it affects the way Swing repaints the specific UI element (panel/label/button/etc) whenever a visual update for that element is required. </p>\n\n<p>For example when you hover a button with the mouse - it might need to repaint if it has a different hover state, whether it's just an icon or a slightly/completely different style. This is where opacity comes into play - <code>opaque=true</code> components will never pass repaint calls \"under\" themselves (in other/proper terms - to their parent components). That means that if you have an opaque button on a panel and it have to be repainted when it changes to \"hover\" state - that button will be the only component to get repainted as there is no reason to repaint anything below it because it is opaque, you literally should not be able to see through it, so the graphics are expected to fill all pixels within bounds of that button with opaque colors. </p>\n\n<p>Theoretically. On practice if you set a button to an opaque state, but keep it's graphics content transparent or semi-transparent (which is obviously a mistake, but Swing will never tell you about it) - you will end up seeing various visual artifacts like the ones you see in your application. That happens due to <code>Graphics2D</code> implementation often performing different paint operations at (0,0) coordinate to optimize their speed - this is not really important to know, but that is partially why you might see other component \"parts\" mixed in your component bounds when it is transparent. It's a bit more complicated than that, but it shouldn't ever really matter as it is simply an internal Swing optimization.</p>\n\n<p>Similar visual problems might also be caused by mixing <code>opaque=true</code> and <code>opaque=false</code> components on the same layout. Most probably that is the case for your issue as well. I did quickly try to set everything in your demo to <code>opaque=false</code> and it did fix the issue, but it's not really the correct way to fix it, especially if you want to keep some components opaque. That just means the problem lies somewhere in the way of mixing components with different opacity types on top of each other within a single container.</p>\n\n<p>My personal recommendation - never mix opaque and non-opaque components in one layout if there is even a slight chance they will overlap (meaning their bounds will intersect within the layout).

make a clean transparent button, I would really appreciate the help.\r\n\r\nI leave here the source code with the test images that I&#39;m using.\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1l8R52WTDyP93L0UhTNd3oorD7Qhv-TcP/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nIn this [image][2], you can see the 3 kind of bugs that I have, in the first one you can see how there&#39;s another button in the background and the scroll bar is shown in the left of the button. In the second one, it&#39;s the header of the navigation panel. In the third one, I passed the mouse multiple times over the selected button and it turned into a solid color instead of a transparent one.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nI decided to check if the bug persisted if I applied it to the navigation panel, because it will have to be transparent as well when the application is finished. So I added the following lines of code in the lines 82 and 83 of the code above:\r\n```\r\n        panelNav.setBackground(new Color(0, 0, 0, 200));\r\n        panelNav.setOpaque(true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this other [image][1] I applied the transparency to the whole navigation panel, which is a JLabel. In the first image is shown what appears when the frame is displayed, there&#39;s even parts of the frame that are displayed beneath the navigation panel. In the second one is shown what happens when I use the scroll bar once.\r\n\r\nEDIT 2:\r\nI replaced all the JLabel that were used as JPanel for actual JPanel. Sadly, the bug persisted. I add an extra button in the main JPanel, I did this because I thought the bug origin from adding buttons to a JScrollPane. But it seems that the problem is directly in how I implement the method buttonName.setBackground().\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the new version of the code:\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1PuHMkEYNbBoafqs5XiyUaeCkIyXfnHFJ/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/pmcww.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/rV8Bm.png","title":"Why is a transparent JButton showing images of the frame when transparency is added?","body":"<p>I'm developing a GUI for a Java application and I want to have a background image. The problem is that I have a type of &quot;drawer&quot; filled with buttons, that has buttons highlighted in red when are selected.</p>\n<p>Im using the method buttonName.setBackground(new Color(255, 102, 102, 200)); to set the highlited button and the transparency at the same time. The problem is that despite that the method works and transparents the button, the transparency shows random parts of the frame behind the button, beign these the header, another button, the scrollbar of the JScrollPane where the buttons are located, etc. The text of the button still shows up, and the button works, but the background shows the text from other buttons or parts of the frame.</p>\n<p>Besides, I realized that if I click a button and pass the mouse over the selected button multiple times, the transparency starts to accumulate to the point that it gets to a solid color.</p>\n<pre><code>package buttonsbug;\n\nimport java.awt.Color;\nimport java.awt.Dimension;\nimport java.awt.Image;\nimport java.awt.Toolkit;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionEvent;\nimport

help.</p>\n<p>I leave here the source code with the test images that I'm using.\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l8R52WTDyP93L0UhTNd3oorD7Qhv-TcP/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow

noreferrer\">image</a>, you can see the 3 kind of bugs that I have, in the first one you can see how there's another button in the background and the scroll bar is shown in the left of the button. In the second one, it's the header of the navigation panel. In the third one, I passed the mouse multiple times over the selected button and it turned into a solid color instead of a transparent one.</p>\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n<p>I decided to check if the bug persisted if I applied it to the navigation panel, because it will have to be transparent as well when the application is finished. So I added the following lines of code in the lines 82 and 83 of the code above:</p>\n<pre><code>        panelNav.setBackground(new Color(0, 0, 0, 200));\n        panelNav.setOpaque(true);\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this other <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pmcww.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">image</a> I applied the transparency to the whole navigation panel, which is a JLabel. In the first image is shown what appears when the frame is displayed, there's even parts of the frame that are displayed beneath the navigation panel. In the second one is shown what happens when I use the scroll bar once.</p>\n<p>EDIT 2:\nI replaced all the JLabel that were used as JPanel for actual JPanel. Sadly, the bug persisted. I add an extra button in the main JPanel, I did this because I thought the bug origin from adding buttons to a JScrollPane. But it seems that the problem is directly in how I implement the method buttonName.setBackground().</p>\n<p>Here's the new version of the code:\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PuHMkEYNbBoafqs5XiyUaeCkIyXfnHFJ/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PuHMkEYNbBoafqs5XiyUaeCkIyXfnHFJ/view?usp=sharing</a></p>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":114128,"reputation":50422,"user_id":300257,"accept_rate":89,"display_name":"Gilbert Le Blanc"},"score":0,"creation_date":1658984069,"post_id":73146539,"comment_id":129188649,"body_markdown":"The simplest solution is not to call the `createConnectionBuilder​()` method at all.
