Let me explain you all things step by step.\r\n\r\n1. You need a string value from your click listener but you are passing a view + position in click. so to fix this you firstly need to change you interface like this.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    public interface onMovieClickListener{\r\n        void onMovieClick(movie movie, int position);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. 2nd mistake is that you don&#39;t have your movie in your ViewHolder. Thats why you can not pass string in your listener. To fix this you need to change your myViewHolder like below.\r\n\r\n  \r\n```java\r\n    public static class myViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder implements View.OnClickListener{\r\n        private final TextView judul, tahun;\r\n        private final ImageView image;\r\n        RelativeLayout parent;\r\n        movie movie;\r\n        onMovieClickListener onMovieClickListener;\r\n\r\n        public myViewHolder(@NonNull View itemView) {\r\n            super(itemView);\r\n            judul = itemView.findViewById(R.id.txtJudul);\r\n            tahun = itemView.findViewById(R.id.txtTahun);\r\n            image = itemView.findViewById(R.id.imagePoster);\r\n            parent = itemView.findViewById(R.id.parent_layout);\r\n            itemView.setOnClickListener(this);\r\n\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n\r\n        public void bind(movie movie, onMovieClickListener onMovieClickListener)\r\n        {\r\n            this.movie = movie;\r\n            this.onMovieClickListener = onMovieClickListener;\r\n            \r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onClick(View view) {\r\n            onMovieClickListener.onMovieClick(movie, this.getLayoutPosition());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n 1. Change your adapter functions like this.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @NonNull\r\n    @Override\r\n    public movieRecyclerViewAdapter.myViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(@NonNull ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {\r\n        View view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.list_movie, parent, false);\r\n        return new myViewHolder(view);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onBindViewHolder(@NonNull movieRecyclerViewAdapter.myViewHolder holder, int position) {\r\n        Log.d(TAG, &quot;onBindViewHolder: called&quot;);\r\n        String img = movies.get(position).getMovie_image();\r\n        holder.judul.setText(movies.get(position).getNamaMovie());\r\n        holder.tahun.setText(movies.get(position).getTahunMovie());\r\n        Picasso.get().load(img).error(R.mipmap.ic_launcher).placeholder(R.mipmap.ic_launcher_round).into(holder.image);\r\n\r\n        holder.bind(movies.get(position), this.movieClickListener);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s IT!!!\r\n\r\nNow you have your movie in your listener and you can use your movie to get any variable inside movie like movie name etc..\r\n\r\nI am pasting whole java file here so that you can just copy and paste code to test.\r\n\r\n    public class movieRecyclerViewAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter&lt;movieRecyclerViewAdapter.myViewHolder&gt; {\r\n\r\n    private static final String TAG = &quot;movieRecyclerViewAdapter&quot;;\r\n    private onMovieClickListener movieClickListener;\r\n    private final ArrayList&lt;movie&gt; movies;\r\n\r\n    public movieRecyclerViewAdapter(ArrayList&lt;movie&gt; movieArrayList, onMovieClickListener onMovieClickListener){\r\n        this.movies = movieArrayList;\r\n        this.movieClickListener = onMovieClickListener;\r\n        Log.d(&quot;mainMenuAdmin&quot;, &quot;Adapter List size : &quot; + movieArrayList.size() );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @NonNull\r\n    @Override\r\n    public movieRecyclerViewAdapter.myViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(@NonNull ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {\r\n        View view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.list_movie, parent, false);\r\n        return new myViewHolder(view);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onBindViewHolder(@NonNull movieRecyclerViewAdapter.myViewHolder holder, int position) {\r\n        Log.d(TAG, &quot;onBindViewHolder: called&quot;);\r\n        String img = movies.get(position).getMovie_image();\r\n        holder.judul.setText(movies.get(position).getNamaMovie());\r\n        holder.tahun.setText(movies.get(position).getTahunMovie());\r\n        Picasso.get().load(img).error(R.mipmap.ic_launcher).placeholder(R.mipmap.ic_launcher_round).into(holder.image);\r\n\r\n        holder.bind(movies.get(position), this.movieClickListener);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int getItemCount() {\r\n        return movies.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static class myViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder implements View.OnClickListener{\r\n        private final TextView judul, tahun;\r\n        private final ImageView image;\r\n        RelativeLayout parent;\r\n        movie movie;\r\n        onMovieClickListener onMovieClickListener;\r\n\r\n        public myViewHolder(@NonNull View itemView) {\r\n            super(itemView);\r\n            judul = itemView.findViewById(R.id.txtJudul);\r\n            tahun = itemView.findViewById(R.id.txtTahun);\r\n            image = itemView.findViewById(R.id.imagePoster);\r\n            parent = itemView.findViewById(R.id.parent_layout);\r\n            itemView.setOnClickListener(this);\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n        public void bind(movie movie, onMovieClickListener onMovieClickListener)\r\n        {\r\n            this.movie = movie;\r\n            this.onMovieClickListener = onMovieClickListener;\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onClick(View view) {\r\n            onMovieClickListener.onMovieClick(movie, this.getLayoutPosition());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public interface onMovieClickListener{\r\n        void onMovieClick(movie movie, int position);\r\n\r\n    }}\r\n\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\n&gt; Few suggestions:\r\n\r\n 1.

This is what I tried:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Query(nativeQuery = true, value = &quot;delete from message where transactionid in (\\n&quot; +\r\n            &quot;select transactionid from message where message_type in ?1 \\n&quot; +\r\n            &quot;                                    and create_timestamp &lt; ?2 \\n&quot; +\r\n            &quot;                            and  rownum &lt; 500 )&quot;)\r\n    Integer deleteByMessageTypeAndCreateTimestampBefore(@Param(value = &quot;messageType&quot;) String messageType, @Param(&quot;maxAge&quot;) Date maxAge);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a way I can do this better?

I made the name of the field `container`, whose type would be `HBox`, but you can name it anything you&#39;d like (just make sure add the corresponding `fx:id` attribute to the FXML file). I also made use of [pattern matching for `instanceof`][3], which was finalized in Java 16. If you are not using at least Java 16, then you&#39;ll need to manually cast `parent` to a `Pane`.\r\n\r\n## Problem With Your Code\r\n\r\nNote you can&#39;t use `this.getParent()`, because the controller itself has never been added to the scene graph. In fact, with how your code is currently written, your controller class should not be extending `HBox` at all (and I assume a similar problem with your other controller class). Perhaps you meant to use [`fx:root`][2], but that would involve changing both the root element of your FXML file and how you load the FXML file. Read the [linked documentation][2] for more information.\r\n\r\nIn other words, unless you want to use `fx:root`, remove the `extends HBox` and `extends BorderPane` from your controller classes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Use a &quot;Callback&quot;\r\n\r\nThe other approach is to use a callback. Add a method to your `ParamValueController` which accepts some functional interface (e.g., `Runnable`):\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\npublic void setOnRemove(Runnable action) {\r\n    // also declare a field to store the Runnable in\r\n    this.action = action;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen your &quot;remove param value&quot; method would look like:\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\n@FXML\r\nprivate void removeParamValue() {\r\n    if (action != null) {\r\n        action.run();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you&#39;d modify the code that loads the &quot;child&quot; FXML like so:\r\n\r\n\r\n```lang-java\r\nprivate HBox createParamValueComponent() throws IOException {\r\n    FXMLLoader paramValueLoader = new FXMLLoader(DoublonController.class.getResource(&quot;paramValue.fxml&quot;));\r\n    HBox root = paramValueLoader.load();\r\n    \r\n    // invoked *after* you load the FXML file\r\n    ParamValueController controller = paramValueLoader.getController();\r\n    controller.setOnRemove(() -&gt; paramValueList.getChildren().remove(root));\r\n\r\n    return root;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPersonally, I prefer this approach as it&#39;s safer, more flexible, and in my opinion clearer. But it is also more work than the first approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72613592/javafx-remove-a-component-from-the-component-itself#comment128268527_72613592\r\n  [2]: https://openjfx.io/javadoc/18/javafx.fxml/javafx/fxml/doc-files/introduction_to_fxml.html#root_elements\r\n  [3]: https://openjdk.org/jeps/394","title":"JavaFX : remove a component from the component itself","body":"<p>There are at least two approaches you can use.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Get the <code>Parent</code></h1>\n<p>As mentioned by @kleopatra in <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72613592/javafx-remove-a-component-from-the-component-itself#comment128268527_72613592\">a question comment</a>, you can get the parent of the root FXML node from within the &quot;child&quot; controller, check if it is an instance of <code>Pane</code> and, if it is, then modify the parent's children list.\nFor example:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@FXML\nprivate void removeParamValue() {\n    var parent = container.getParent();\n    if (parent instanceof Pane pane) {\n        pane.getChildren().remove(container);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This requires you to inject the root FXML element into the controller.

Add a method to your <code>ParamValueController</code> which accepts some functional interface (e.g., <code>Runnable</code>):</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public void setOnRemove(Runnable action) {\n    // also declare a field to store the Runnable in\n    this.action = action;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then your &quot;remove param value&quot; method would look like:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>@FXML\nprivate void removeParamValue() {\n    if (action != null) {\n        action.run();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And you'd modify the code that loads the &quot;child&quot; FXML like so:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>private HBox createParamValueComponent() throws IOException {\n    FXMLLoader paramValueLoader = new FXMLLoader(DoublonController.class.getResource(&quot;paramValue.fxml&quot;));\n    HBox root = paramValueLoader.load();\n    \n    // invoked *after* you load the FXML file\n    ParamValueController controller = paramValueLoader.getController();\n    controller.setOnRemove(() -&gt; paramValueList.getChildren().remove(root));\n\n    return root;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Personally, I prefer this approach as it's safer, more flexible, and in my opinion clearer. But it is also more work than the first approach.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":25436572,"reputation":53,"user_id":19240205,"display_name":"Luca170598"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":444,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":72622972,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1655238619,"creation_date":1655194444,"question_id":72613592,"body_markdown":"I have a simple JavaFX application with main controller.

Skip the Learning Swing with the NetBeans IDE section.  Pay particular attention to the [Performing Custom Painting](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/painting/index.html) section.\r\n\r\nI reworked your GUI.  Here&#39;s what it looks like now.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nI move the X and Y axis around so that the graph fits in the drawing area.  The minimum and maximum V values are no less than -10 and 10, respectively.  I show the calculated Y minimum and maximum values in the entry panel.  The X axis and Y axis are not to the same scale.\r\n\r\n# Explanation\r\n\r\nWhen I create a Swing GUI, I use the [model-view-controller][2] (MVC) pattern.  This pattern helps me to separate my concerns and focus on one small part of the application at a time.\r\n\r\nThe application model for a Swing GUI consists of one or more plain Java getter/setter classes.\r\n\r\nThe view consists of one and only one `JFrame` and as many `JPanels` as I need to create the GUI.  You can nest multiple simple `JPanels` to create a complex layout.\r\n\r\nThe controller consists of one or more `Actions` or `Listeners`.  There&#39;s usually not one controller to &quot;rule them all&quot;.  Each `Action` or `Listener` is responsible for its part of the model and view.\r\n\r\nI didn&#39;t write all the code at once.  I wrote a little and tested a lot.  I probably ran 150 - 200 tests of the GUI before I was satisfied.\r\n\r\n## Model\r\n\r\nI created one plain Java getter/setter class, the `GraphPlotterModel` class.  This class holds the X and Y minimum and maximum values, and a `java.util.List` of `Point2D` instances that make up the graph.  I also define a starting `Dimension` in pixels for the drawing `JPanel`.  The dimensions of the drawing `JPanel` can change.  One way is to maximize the GUI.\r\n\r\nThe model also holds the calculation of the quadratic equation.  I go from the X minimum to the X maximum, calculating the corresponding Y value.  The X and Y values are in units.\r\n\r\n## View\r\n\r\nI started the GUI with a call to the `SwingUtilities` `invokeLater` method.  This method ensures that the Swing components are created and executed on the [Event Dispatch Thread][3].\r\n\r\nI separated the creation of the `JFrame` from the creation of the `JPanels`.  This allows me to separate my concerns and focus on one small part of the application at a time.  The top `JPanel` is made up of two individual `JPanels`, one for the title and one for the entry fields.  The center `JPanel` is a standard drawing panel.\r\n\r\nGenerally, you define Swing components on a `JPanel` in column, row order.  This makes the code easier to read and understand.\r\n\r\nThe drawing panel has a method to convert units to pixels.  This method probably took 1/3 of my total development time.  The biggest hurdle is that a standard graph goes up from the Y minimum to the Y maximum and the Y pixels go from top to bottom.  I basically use ratios to calculate the pixels.\r\n\r\n## Controller\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s only one `JButton`, so there&#39;s only one `ActionListener`.

Skip the Learning Swing with the NetBeans IDE section.  Pay particular attention to the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/painting/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Performing Custom Painting</a> section.</p>\n<p>I reworked your GUI.  Here's what it looks like now.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2vCix.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2vCix.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>I move the X and Y axis around so that the graph fits in the drawing area.  The minimum and maximum V values are no less than -10 and 10, respectively.  I show the calculated Y minimum and maximum values in the entry panel.  The X axis and Y axis are not to the same scale.</p>\n<h1>Explanation</h1>\n<p>When I create a Swing GUI, I use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">model-view-controller</a> (MVC) pattern.  This pattern helps me to separate my concerns and focus on one small part of the application at a time.</p>\n<p>The application model for a Swing GUI consists of one or more plain Java getter/setter classes.</p>\n<p>The view consists of one and only one <code>JFrame</code> and as many <code>JPanels</code> as I need to create the GUI.  You can nest multiple simple <code>JPanels</code> to create a complex layout.</p>\n<p>The controller consists of one or more <code>Actions</code> or <code>Listeners</code>.  There's usually not one controller to &quot;rule them all&quot;.  Each <code>Action</code> or <code>Listener</code> is responsible for its part of the model and view.</p>\n<p>I didn't write all the code at once.  I wrote a little and tested a lot.  I probably ran 150 - 200 tests of the GUI before I was satisfied.</p>\n<h2>Model</h2>\n<p>I created one plain Java getter/setter class, the <code>GraphPlotterModel</code> class.  This class holds the X and Y minimum and maximum values, and a <code>java.util.List</code> of <code>Point2D</code> instances that make up the graph.  I also define a starting <code>Dimension</code> in pixels for the drawing <code>JPanel</code>.  The dimensions of the drawing <code>JPanel</code> can change.  One way is to maximize the GUI.</p>\n<p>The model also holds the calculation of the quadratic equation.  I go from the X minimum to the X maximum, calculating the corresponding Y value.  The X and Y values are in units.</p>\n<h2>View</h2>\n<p>I started the GUI with a call to the <code>SwingUtilities</code> <code>invokeLater</code> method.  This method ensures that the Swing components are created and executed on the <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/dispatch.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Event Dispatch Thread</a>.</p>\n<p>I separated the creation of the <code>JFrame</code> from the creation of the <code>JPanels</code>.  This allows me to separate my concerns and focus on one small part of the application at a time.  The top <code>JPanel</code> is made up of two individual <code>JPanels</code>, one for the title and one for the entry fields.  The center <code>JPanel</code> is a standard drawing panel.</p>\n<p>Generally, you define Swing components on a <code>JPanel</code> in column, row order.  This makes the code easier to read and understand.</p>\n<p>The drawing panel has a method to convert units to pixels.  This method probably took 1/3 of my total development time.  The biggest hurdle is that a standard graph goes up from the Y minimum to the Y maximum and the Y pixels go from top to bottom.  I basically use ratios to calculate the pixels.</p>\n<h2>Controller</h2>\n<p>There's only one <code>JButton</code>, so there's only one <code>ActionListener</code>.  I made it a separate private class because it has a lot of code and I didn't want to have to pass 5 input fields to a separate class.

have been trying very hard these past days to understand Graphics2d. I do understand the shapes an all, however I can not draw a simple Graph with it.\r\n\r\nMy Goal is to draw a Coordinate System, that you can change its length if you want to. Like you say the min x Value would be -5 and the max x Value would be 10 and it would scale it self to it and the function too. However I have a really big Problem just creating and scaling the axis correctly. I think this just comes from a high not understanding everything correctly. This is why I  would be glad if someone could help me with this matter.\r\n\r\nHere is the code I have been working on. It is absolutely not finished. However I would like to get the scaling and all right. But ever other correction is gladly welcomed, due to me being a newbie in java.\r\nI also tried to make it that if like min x would be positive there would be no x axis.

I do understand the shapes an all, however I can not draw a simple Graph with it.</p>\n<p>My Goal is to draw a Coordinate System, that you can change its length if you want to. Like you say the min x Value would be -5 and the max x Value would be 10 and it would scale it self to it and the function too. However I have a really big Problem just creating and scaling the axis correctly. I think this just comes from a high not understanding everything correctly. This is why I  would be glad if someone could help me with this matter.</p>\n<p>Here is the code I have been working on. It is absolutely not finished. However I would like to get the scaling and all right. But ever other correction is gladly welcomed, due to me being a newbie in java.\nI also tried to make it that if like min x would be positive there would be no x axis.

of the universe).  Physics does not unequivocally know the one-way speed of light, only the two-way speed.  No experiment we have so far devised can answer that question. See [The One-Way Speed of Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_speed_of_light).\r\n\r\n&gt;Although the average speed over a two-way path can be measured, the one-way speed in one direction or the other is undefined (and not simply unknown), unless one can define what is &quot;the same time&quot; in two different locations. To measure the time that the light has taken to travel from one place to another it is necessary to know the start and finish times as measured on the same time scale. This requires either two synchronized clocks, one at the start and one at the finish, or some means of sending a signal instantaneously from the start to the finish.

Physics does not unequivocally know the one-way speed of light, only the two-way speed.  No experiment we have so far devised can answer that question. See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_speed_of_light\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The One-Way Speed of Light</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although the average speed over a two-way path can be measured, the one-way speed in one direction or the other is undefined (and not simply unknown), unless one can define what is &quot;the same time&quot; in two different locations. To measure the time that the light has taken to travel from one place to another it is necessary to know the start and finish times as measured on the same time scale. This requires either two synchronized clocks, one at the start and one at the finish, or some means of sending a signal instantaneously from the start to the finish. No instantaneous means of transmitting information is known. Thus the measured value of the average one-way speed is dependent on the method used to synchronize the start and finish clocks. This is a matter of convention.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can get arbitrarily close for non-relativistic situations by synchronizing clocks, but how do you know the clocks stay synchronized?

But, this now means that in my database I have transformed the is a relationship in to has a? *The subclass now has a card rather than is a card.* \r\n\r\nI am confused and hope someone can clear things up for me.\r\n\r\nThanks","title":"Confused with potential is a and has a relationship","body":"<p>I am trying to configure a new database design seeing as we have decided to make the move to Hibernate.
