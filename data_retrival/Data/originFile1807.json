This approach allows you to reuse your type conversion logic in different entities.</p></li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":272682,"reputation":201,"user_id":563899,"display_name":"mirlord"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":false,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1395143414,"creation_date":1395143414,"answer_id":22478527,"question_id":12390068,"body_markdown":"More efficient way (that uses `int` instead of `byte[]`) requires a pretty simple custom class:\r\n\r\n    @Entity\r\n    @Access(AccessType.FIELD)\r\n    public class SampleEntity {\r\n\r\n        @Transient\r\n        private IntBitSet isolationLevel = new IntBitSet(0);\r\n\r\n        public static final int USER_BIT = 0;\r\n        public static final int DEVICE_BIT = 1;\r\n        // 2, 3, 4, ...\r\n\r\n        public boolean isUserIsolated() {\r\n            return isolationLevel.bitGet(USER_BIT);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public boolean isDeviceIsolated() {\r\n            return isolationLevel.bitGet(DEVICE_BIT);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void setUserIsolated(boolean b) {\r\n            isolationLevel.bitSet(USER_BIT, b);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void setDeviceIsolated(boolean b) {\r\n            isolationLevel.bitSet(DEVICE_BIT, b);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Access(AccessType.PROPERTY)\r\n        @Column\r\n        public int getIsolationLevel() {\r\n            return isolationLevel.getValue();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void setIsolationLevel(int isolationLevel) {\r\n            this.isolationLevel = new IntBitSet(isolationLevel);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private static class IntBitSet {\r\n            private int value;\r\n\r\n            public IntBitSet(int value) {\r\n                this.value = value;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            public int getValue() {\r\n                return value;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            public boolean bitGet(int i) {\r\n                return ((value &gt;&gt;

Notice <code>org.apache.kafka:kafka_2.11:jar:0.10.0.0</code> included as part of <code>my.company.riptide.api:ness-logger:jar:1.0.0</code> but <code>org.springframework.kafka:spring-kafka-test:jar:2.7.9</code> includes a newer version <code>org.apache.kafka:kafka_2.13:jar:2.7.2</code></p>\n<p>My solution was to exclude kafaka_2.11 from my ness-logger dependency like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;my.company.riptide.api&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;ness-logger&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;1.0.0&lt;/version&gt;\n  &lt;exclusions&gt;\n    &lt;exclusion&gt;\n      &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.kafka&lt;/groupId&gt;\n      &lt;artifactId&gt;kafka_2.11&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;/exclusion&gt;\n  &lt;/exclusions&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Truncated output of <code>mvn

You have to use, and thus expose, those enum names.

I don't like this particular approach, but it will &quot;work&quot; for what you need. That said, it will only call the method if the entered string value is either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;y&quot;.</p>\n<p>Also, notice that I use <code>next()</code> instead of <code>nextLine()</code>. This is very important because you are comparing for equality and not with <code>startsWith()</code> or some other method. The function <code>nextLine()</code> is more suited for cases when the inputted string is more than a word (words separated by whitespaces).</p>\n<p>Lastly, never forget to close your I/O resources.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":3430512,"reputation":9378,"user_id":2875080,"accept_rate":43,"display_name":"icekomo"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":93,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1638214754,"accepted_answer_id":70159332,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1638209199,"creation_date":1638207008,"question_id":70158840,"body_markdown":"I have a simple Java program that asks a series of questions.

For [example][1].\r\n\r\nYou will notice this `@Cacheable`, `@Service` class [extends][2] an abstract base class ([`CacheableService`][3]) to help manage the &quot;cacheable&quot; state. That way, multiple `@Cacheable`, `@Service` classes can utilize this functionality if need be.\r\n\r\nThe `CacheableService` class contains methods to query the state of the cache operation, like [`isCacheMiss()`][4] and [`isCacheHit()`][5]. Inside the `@Cacheable` methods, when invoked due to a &quot;cache miss&quot;, is where you would set this bit, by calling [`setCacheMiss()`][6].  Again, the `setCacheMiss()` method is [called like so][1], inside your `@Cacheable` service [method][7].\r\n\r\nHowever, a few words of caution!\r\n\r\nFirst, while the abstract `CacheableService` class [manages the state][8] of the `cacheMiss` bit with a Thread-safe class (i.e. `AtomicBoolean`), the `CacheableService` class itself is **not** Thread-safe when used in a highly concurrent environment when you have multiple `@Cacheable` service methods setting the `cacheMiss` bit.\r\n\r\nThat is, if you have a component class with multiple `@Cacheable` service methods all setting the `cacheMiss` bit using `setCacheMiss()` in a multi-Threaded environment (which is especially `true` in a Web application) then it is possible to read stale state of `cacheMiss` when querying the bit. Meaning, the `cacheMiss` bit could be `true` or `false` depending on the state of the cache, the operation called and the interleaving of Threads. Therefore, more work is needed in this case, so be careful if you are relying on the state of the `cacheMiss` bit for critical decisions.\r\n\r\nSecond, this approach, using an abstract `CacheableService` class, does not work for *Spring Data* (CRUD) *Repositories* based on an interface. As others have mentioned in the comments, you could encapsulate this caching logic in an AOP Advice and intercept the appropriate calls, in this case. Personally, I prefer that caching, security, transactions, etc, all be managed in the Service layer of the application rather than the Data Access layer.\r\n\r\nFinally, there are undoubtedly other limitations you might run into, as the example code I have provided above was never meant for production, only demonstration purposes.
