The problem is that I am performing massive copying and regularly hit errors and I still want to retry.\r\n\r\nThis solution seems almost obvious now but it took me over 2 days to figure this out particularly due to how hard the errors are to reproduce reliably. 99.99% of the time, it works. But my migration always failed on and skipped about a hundred files in a million.

So we cannot answer precisely. But my guess is that you have unwittingly switched between schema. \r\n\r\nSo one schema contains the table you created earlier. Then later you connect to another schema, but alas no such table found in this other schema.\r\n\r\nTo quote [this Derby documentation][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt;The current schema for any connection defaults to a schema corresponding to the user name.

Can you, please, describe it more?\n\n - If you want to be able to add both at one time, than you can do the which is nicely described by @Sanket Parikh. Put Integer and String into a new class and use that.\n - If you want to add the list either a String or an int, but only one of these at a time, then sure it is the `List&lt;Object&gt;`\n\n   which looks good but only for first sight! This is not a good pattern. You&#39;ll have to check what type of object you have each time you get an object from your list. Also This type of list can contain any other types as well.. So no, not a nice solution. Although maybe for a beginner it can be used. If you choose this, i would recommend to check what is &quot;instanceof&quot; in Java.\n - I would strongly advise to reconsider your needs and think about maybe your real nead is to encapsulate Integers to a `List&lt;Integer&gt;` and Strings to a separate `List&lt;String&gt;`\n\nCan i tell you a metaphor for what you want to do now? I would say you want to make a List wich can contain coffee beans and coffee shops. These to type of objects are totally different! Why are these put onto the same shelf? :)\n\nOr do you have maybe data which can be a word or a number? Yepp! This would make sense, both of them is data!

The steps are as follows:\r\n 1. First [install the Cloud SDK][2].\r\n 2. Then [initialize the Cloud SDK][3]. At step 4, select the project you are working on.\r\n 3. Then you can run `gcloud auth application-default login`  [command][4].\r\n\tAs posted in this [answer][5]:\r\n\t&gt; This obtains your credentials via a web flow and stores them in _&#39;the well-known location for Application Default Credentials&#39;_. Now, any code/SDK you run will be able to find the credentials automatically. This is a good stand-in when you want to locally test code which would normally run on a server and use a server-side credentials file.\r\n \r\n## [Connecting to  _Storage_][6]\r\n\r\nBefore we can use Google Cloud storage, we have to create a service object. If we&#39;ve already set up the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable, we can use the default instance:\r\n```java\r\nStorage storage = StorageOptions.getDefaultInstance().getService();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we don&#39;t want to use the environment variable, we have to create a `Credentials` instance and pass it to `Storage` with the project name:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nCredentials credentials = GoogleCredentials.fromStream(new FileInputStream(&quot;path/to/file&quot;));\r\n// The ID of your GCP project\r\n// String projectId = &quot;your-project-id&quot;;\r\nStorage storage = StorageOptions.newBuilder().setCredentials(credentials).setProjectId(&quot;your-project-id&quot;).build().getService();\r\n```\r\n## [Creating a _Bucket_][7]\r\n\r\nBuckets are containers that hold objects. They can be used to organize and control data access.\r\n\r\nCreating a bucket requires a `BucketInfo`:\r\n```java\r\nBucket bucket = storage.create(BucketInfo.of(&quot;sample-bucket&quot;));\r\n```\r\nFor this simple example, we pass a bucket name and accept the default properties. Bucket names must be globally unique and also have to follow [some requirements][9]. For example, if we choose a name that is already used, `create()` will fail.\r\n\r\n## [Reading data][8]\r\nBlobs are assigned a  _BlobId_  upon creation.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to retrieve a Blob is with  `BlobId`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nBlob blob = storage.get(blobId);\r\nString value = new String(blob.getContent());\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe pass the id to  `Storage`  and get the  `Blob`  in return, and  `getContent()`  returns the bytes.\r\n\r\nIf we don&#39;t have the  `BlobId`, we can search the Bucket by name:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// The ID of your GCS bucket\r\n// String bucketName = &quot;your-unique-bucket-name&quot;;\r\nPage&lt;Blob&gt; blobs = storage.list(bucketName);\r\nfor (Blob blob: blobs.getValues()) {\r\n    if (name.equals(blob.getName())) {\r\n        return new String(blob.getContent());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### [Listing Objects][10]\r\nThis is a code sample of a function that list all the objects in a Cloud Storage bucket.\r\n```java\r\nimport com.google.api.gax.paging.Page;\r\nimport com.google.cloud.storage.Blob;\r\nimport com.google.cloud.storage.Storage;\r\nimport com.google.cloud.storage.StorageOptions;\r\n\r\npublic class ListObjects {\r\n  public static void listObjects(String projectId, String bucketName) {\r\n    // The ID of your GCP project\r\n    // String projectId = &quot;your-project-id&quot;;\r\n\r\n    // The ID of your GCS bucket\r\n    // String bucketName = &quot;your-unique-bucket-name&quot;;\r\n\r\n    Storage storage = StorageOptions.newBuilder().setProjectId(projectId).build().getService();\r\n    Page&lt;Blob&gt; blobs = storage.list(bucketName);\r\n\r\n    for (Blob blob : blobs.iterateAll()) {\r\n      System.out.println(blob.getName());\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-java#authentication\r\n\r\n[0]: https://www.baeldung.com/java-google-cloud-storage#dependency\r\n[1]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-gcp/docs/1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#_credentials\r\n[2]: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart#installing_the_latest_version\r\n[3]: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart#initializing_the\r\n[4]: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login\r\n[5]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/53307505/13171940\r\n[6]: https://www.baeldung.com/java-google-cloud-storage#connect_bucket\r\n[7]: https://www.baeldung.com/java-google-cloud-storage#bucket\r\n[8]: https://www.baeldung.com/java-google-cloud-storage#data\r\n[9]: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming-buckets\r\n[10]: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/samples/storage-list-files#storage_list_files-java","title":"ERROR 401 Unauthorized: Anonymous caller does not have storage.buckets.get access to the Google Cloud Storage bucket in spring boot application","body":"<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Create a <code>Credentials</code> instance:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>Credentials credentials = GoogleCredentials.fromStream(new FileInputStream(&quot;path/to/file&quot;)); \n</code></pre>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/java-google-cloud-storage#dependency\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Google Cloud Storage Setup</a></h2>\n<p>From the <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-gcp/docs/1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#_credentials\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">documentation</a>, there are some ways to load the credentials*, besides the one you are already using:\n*Notice that these ways will be used if credentials aren’t specified through properties file</p>\n<h3>Environment variable</h3>\n<p>You can set up the environment variable <code>GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS</code> and use the default instance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For Linux or Mac:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre class=\"lang-sh prettyprint-override\"><code>export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=&quot;/path/to/file&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For Windows:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=&quot;C:\\path\\to\\file&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the easiest way to load the credentials.</p>\n<h3>Cloud SDK</h3>\n<p>Another way is to provide the credentials using Google Cloud SDK.

That part looks weird to me.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":4470050,"reputation":68258,"user_id":3636601,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"Jens"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1637823198,"creation_date":1637823198,"answer_id":70106911,"question_id":70106215,"body_markdown":"396.00 is a Double not an int value. \r\nSo you have to parse it as a double:\r\n\r\n    Double.valueOf(cx).intValue() \r\n\r\nSo your code looks like:\r\n\r\n    if(jCheckBox1.isSelected())\r\n          {\r\n              String bx=&quot;Insert into supplierpaymenttable(Supplier_ID,SupplierInvoice_ID,User_ID,InvoiceNo,TotalAmount,PaymentAmount,RemainingBalance) VALUES (?,?,?,?,?,?,?)&quot;;\r\n              \r\n            \r\n      \r\n               PreparedStatement pay=conn.prepareStatement(bx);\r\n                 int k=Double.valueOf(jTextField5.getText()).intValue();\r\n                   int cx=k-k;\r\n            \r\n\r\n           pay.setString(1,String.valueOf(supplier));\r\n           pay.setString(2,String.valueOf(det));\r\n           pay.setString(3,&quot;1&quot;);\r\n           pay.setString(4, String.valueOf(invoie));\r\n           pay.setInt(5, Integer.valueOf(jTextField5.getText()));\r\n           pay.setInt(6, Integer.valueOf(jTextField5.getText()));\r\n         \r\n           pay.setInt(7,Double.valueOf(cx).intValue());\r\n             int rsdets= pay.executeUpdate();\r\n          }\r\n","title":"How to solve java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: &quot;396.00&quot;","body":"<p>396.00 is a Double not an int value.\nSo you have to parse it as a double:</p>\n<pre><code>Double.valueOf(cx).intValue() \n</code></pre>\n<p>So your code looks like:</p>\n<pre><code>if(jCheckBox1.isSelected())\n      {\n          String bx=&quot;Insert into supplierpaymenttable(Supplier_ID,SupplierInvoice_ID,User_ID,InvoiceNo,TotalAmount,PaymentAmount,RemainingBalance) VALUES (?,?,?,?,?,?,?)&quot;;\n          \n        \n  \n           PreparedStatement pay=conn.prepareStatement(bx);\n             int k=Double.valueOf(jTextField5.getText()).intValue();\n               int cx=k-k;\n        \n\n       pay.setString(1,String.valueOf(supplier));\n       pay.setString(2,String.valueOf(det));\n       pay.setString(3,&quot;1&quot;);\n       pay.setString(4, String.valueOf(invoie));\n       pay.setInt(5, Integer.valueOf(jTextField5.getText()));\n       pay.setInt(6, Integer.valueOf(jTextField5.getText()));\n     \n       pay.setInt(7,Double.valueOf(cx).intValue());\n         int rsdets= pay.executeUpdate();\n      }\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":20819160,"reputation":11,"user_id":15291271,"display_name":"ahad nadeem"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":737,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1637869588,"creation_date":1637818335,"question_id":70106215,"body_markdown":"I have made a small application in java.

The tool will locate, download, and place the JDBC driver’s JAR file into your project.\r\n - If manually managing your dependencies, download the driver and place within the correct folder for your project. \r\n\r\nAt deployment time, the JDBC driver is automatically registered with the [JVM][2] via the [SPI][3] facility in Java. This works as long as the driver appears on the Java [Classpath][4].\r\n\r\nOne exception is for web-app servers such as Apache Tomcat. In such a case, you may need to install the JDBC driver manually into a special location for that server rather than within your app. This has been covered many times on Stack Overflow, so search to learn more.\r\n\r\nThe driver *PostgreSQL JDBC Driver 42.3.1* from [here](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/) is a [Type 4 driver][5].

So you pop off the head, and add its child roles to the processing queue. Then you add the head to the completed list, and run the function again on that new state.\r\n\r\nBy always adding the child roles to the front of the processing queue (``head.childRoles.plus(tail)``) you&#39;re ensuring they get processed next, so you end up with **depth-first** traversal. If you add them to the end (``tail.plus(head.childRoles)``) you ensure every layer that&#39;s been added gets processed before any of that layer&#39;s children, so you get **breadth-first** traversal.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe ``tailrec`` modifier is an optimisation for tail-recursive functions, where the **last thing** a function does is call itself.

So you pop off the head, and add its child roles to the processing queue. Then you add the head to the completed list, and run the function again on that new state.</p>\n<p>By always adding the child roles to the front of the processing queue (<code>head.childRoles.plus(tail)</code>) you're ensuring they get processed next, so you end up with <strong>depth-first</strong> traversal. If you add them to the end (<code>tail.plus(head.childRoles)</code>) you ensure every layer that's been added gets processed before any of that layer's children, so you get <strong>breadth-first</strong> traversal.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The <code>tailrec</code> modifier is an optimisation for tail-recursive functions, where the <strong>last thing</strong> a function does is call itself.
