So, consider the following class:\r\n\r\n    package test;\r\n\r\n    public class Demo {\r\n    \r\n        public Demo() {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Hi!&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n            Class clazz = Class.forName(&quot;test.Demo&quot;);\r\n            Demo demo = (Demo) clazz.newInstance();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAs explained in its javadoc, calling [`Class.forName(String)`][1] *returns the `Class` object associated with the class or interface with the given string name* i.e. it returns `test.Demo.class` which is affected to the `clazz` variable of type `Class`.\r\n\r\nThen, calling [`clazz.newInstance()`][2] *creates a new instance of the class represented by this `Class`  object. The class is instantiated as if by a `new` expression with an empty argument list.* In other words, this is here actually equivalent to a `new Demo()` and returns a new instance of `Demo`.\r\n\r\nAnd running this `Demo` class thus prints the following output:\r\n\r\n    Hi!\r\n\r\nThe big difference with the traditional `new` is that `newInstance` allows to instantiate a class that you don&#39;t know until runtime, making your code more dynamic. \r\n\r\nA typical example is the JDBC API which loads, at runtime, the exact driver required to perform the work. EJBs containers, Servlet containers are other good examples: they use dynamic runtime loading to load and create components they don&#39;t know anything before the runtime.\r\n\r\nActually, if you want to go further, have a look at Ted Neward paper [Understanding Class.forName()][3] that I was paraphrasing in the paragraph just above.\r\n\r\n**EDIT** (answering a question from the OP posted as comment): The case of JDBC drivers is a bit special. As explained in the [DriverManager][4] chapter of [Getting Started with the JDBC API][5]:\r\n\r\n&gt; (...) A `Driver` class is loaded, and\r\n&gt; therefore automatically registered\r\n&gt; with the `DriverManager`, in one of two\r\n&gt; ways:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 1. by calling the method `Class.forName`. This explicitly loads\r\n&gt; the driver class. Since it does not\r\n&gt; depend on any external setup, this way\r\n&gt; of loading a driver is the recommended\r\n&gt; one for using the `DriverManager`\r\n&gt; framework. The following code loads\r\n&gt; the class `acme.db.Driver`:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;         Class.forName(&quot;acme.db.Driver&quot;);\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;   **If `acme.db.Driver` has been written so that loading it causes an\r\n&gt; instance to be created and also calls\r\n&gt; `DriverManager.registerDriver` with that\r\n&gt; instance as the parameter** (as it\r\n&gt; should do), then it is in the\r\n&gt; `DriverManager`&#39;s list of drivers and\r\n&gt; available for creating a connection.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 2.

No matter what the periods of the two sequences are, there will always be a point in time where they are both starting a new cycle at that same point in time, possibly with an offset.  From that point on, everything that happens will be a repeat of what happened in that first cyce.\r\n\r\nTo get the length of this cycle, one just needs to find the least common multiple of the two repeat intervals.  In the worst case, which occurs when one of the two intervals is a prime number, that period will be `interval1 * interval2`.  If the numbers are not primes, any common factors that they share  will mean that the cycle length will be reduced.  Here&#39;s the Python function that will calculate the least common multiple:\r\n\r\n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\r\n        return abs(a*b) // math.gcd(a, b)\r\n\r\nIf the two sequences started at the same time, everything would be pretty simple from here.  But if the two intervals start at different times, things get more complicated.  We basically have to allow for the fact that a single cycle won&#39;t capture all of both sequences, because one sequence might start a little before the single cycle starts, and another might end after the cycle starts.  \r\n\r\nI reasoned out what had to be done to take the offset of the two sequences into account, and also accounted for the duration possibly extending things out a bit.  I might not have gotten this quite right.  I&#39;ve created a couple of examples, reasoned out by hand what the overlap would be, and then run those examples through my code and I got the same answers.  So it should be correct.\r\n\r\nSo here it is in all its gory glory:\r\n\r\n    import math\r\n    \r\n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\r\n        return abs(a*b) // math.gcd(a, b)\r\n    \r\n    # First sequence\r\n    # 15-20, 30-35, 45-50, 60-65\r\n    seq1 = {\r\n        &#39;start&#39;: 15,\r\n        &#39;repeat_interval&#39;: 15,\r\n        &#39;duration&#39;: 5,\r\n        &#39;extra&#39;: 0,\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    # Second sequence\r\n    # 5-11, 25-31, 45-51, 65-71\r\n    seq2 = {\r\n        &#39;start&#39;: 5,\r\n        &#39;repeat_interval&#39;: 20,\r\n        &#39;duration&#39;: 6,\r\n        &#39;extra&#39;: 0,\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    # Overlap by inspection: 30, 45-49\r\n    \r\n    # Compute the magic value, the number of minutes at which the two sequences start over at the same time offset as for the initial cycle.\r\n    lcm = compute_lcm(seq1[&#39;repeat_interval&#39;], seq2[&#39;repeat_interval&#39;])\r\n    \r\n    overall_start = 0\r\n    \r\n    # This stuff&#39;s a bit crazy, I know.

No matter what the periods of the two sequences are, there will always be a point in time where they are both starting a new cycle at that same point in time, possibly with an offset.  From that point on, everything that happens will be a repeat of what happened in that first cyce.</p>\n<p>To get the length of this cycle, one just needs to find the least common multiple of the two repeat intervals.  In the worst case, which occurs when one of the two intervals is a prime number, that period will be <code>interval1 * interval2</code>.  If the numbers are not primes, any common factors that they share  will mean that the cycle length will be reduced.  Here's the Python function that will calculate the least common multiple:</p>\n<pre><code>def compute_lcm(a, b):\n    return abs(a*b) // math.gcd(a, b)\n</code></pre>\n<p>If the two sequences started at the same time, everything would be pretty simple from here.  But if the two intervals start at different times, things get more complicated.  We basically have to allow for the fact that a single cycle won't capture all of both sequences, because one sequence might start a little before the single cycle starts, and another might end after the cycle starts.</p>\n<p>I reasoned out what had to be done to take the offset of the two sequences into account, and also accounted for the duration possibly extending things out a bit.  I might not have gotten this quite right.  I've created a couple of examples, reasoned out by hand what the overlap would be, and then run those examples through my code and I got the same answers.

If I understand correctly, with the new API I would need to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a <code>SessionFactory</code> that understands about <code>FieldDefinition</code>.</li>\n<li>Use it to access it and retrieve the <code>FieldDefinition</code>s.</li>\n<li>Having the instances of these entities, create a second <code>SessionFactory</code> (because <code>SessionFactory</code> is immutable, so I cannot modify the first one), where during the creation I use the <code>MetadataSources.addFile()</code> (or <code>.addInputStream()</code>) to add <code>hbm.xml</code> files I need to create on the fly based on the <code>FieldDefinition</code> data to map the additional columns to the <code>additionalFields</code> maps (I couldn't find a programmatic way of adding mappings as was the case with <code>configuration.createMappings()</code>).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Alternatively, I can skip the first <code>SessionFactory</code> creation if I use the <code>DataSource</code> and JDBC directly, but the rest stays the same. I found <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46951153/how-to-manually-add-hibernate-mappings-in-hibernate-5\">this other SO question which points to more or less the same</a>.

What you did with the aspect could work, but only if the relevant objects are created by spring itself (i.e. doing <code>new Dragon()</code> won&#39;t work)."},{"owner":{"account_id":1038596,"reputation":34548,"user_id":1045142,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"Simon Martinelli"},"score":1,"creation_date":1664536544,"post_id":73907839,"comment_id":130499893,"body_markdown":"Please read https://www.baeldung.com/java-annotation-processing-builder","body":"Please read <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/java-annotation-processing-builder\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">baeldung.com/java-annotation-processing-builder</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":1038596,"reputation":34548,"user_id":1045142,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"Simon Martinelli"},"score":0,"creation_date":1664536595,"post_id":73907839,"comment_id":130499912,"body_markdown":"@JoachimSauer this is not cheating.

E.g. you can run your application using something like `java -cp myapp.jar;plugins/* my.app.Main`, then all the plugin-Jars in folder plugin will be added to the class-path and are available to your application (for more information on the asterisk, see this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/219801/19657183)).\r\n\r\nIf you want to load plug-ins at runtime, you can use a URLClassLoader, e. g. read this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65390431/serviceloader-with-urlclassloader-not-finding-service) or this [tutorial](https://riptutorial.com/java/example/23970/using-urlclassloader) on how to use the URLClassLoader.","title":"How do I load .class files into a variable?","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>My plan was to use loadClass when the game is started to add them to a Scene-array, but it requires the class names which I can't know, since there can a any random combination of scenes in the Scenes-folder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's what Service Provider Interfaces are for.

You wrote in your question that `p` should appear above the Sudoku board (which is `field` in your code). Hence you should chenge the above line to:\r\n```java\r\nf.add(p, BorderLayout.PAGE_START);\r\n```\r\nYou are also adding `p` to `field`.\r\n```java\r\nfield.add(p);\r\n```\r\nYou need to remove this line.\r\n```java\r\nfield.setLayout(new GridLayout(9, 9));\r\n```\r\nFor [GridLayout](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/grid.html) you only need to set one dimension, so replace the above line with:\r\n```java\r\nfield.setLayout(new GridLayout(0, 9));\r\n```\r\nThis ensures that there will be, at most, nine columns in each row of the grid.\r\n```java\r\nf.setLayout(new

default.\r\n```java\r\nf.add(field, BorderLayout.CENTER);\r\n```\r\nAdd `field` to `f` **after** you have added all the components to `field`.\r\n```java\r\np.setSize(700, 50);\r\n```\r\nI think it is
