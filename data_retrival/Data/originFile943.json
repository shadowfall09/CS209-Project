Instead, <em>loop</em> over reading the input until correct input is received.  Perhaps something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\nint a = 0;\nwhile (a &lt; 2) {\n    // your loop logic\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice how <code>a</code> is initialized to something that will cause us to enter the loop.  Then <em>in the loop</em> is the operation we want to repeat, where we will continually ask for input <em>until</em> <code>a</code> is a valid value:</p>\n<pre><code>Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\nint a = 0;\nwhile (a &lt; 2) {\n    System.out.println(&quot;Enter number to find Pythagorean Triplet : &quot;);\n    a = sc.nextInt();\n    if (a &lt; 2) {\n        System.out.println(&quot;&quot;);\n        System.out.println(&quot;Your number is not a natural number or is 1&quot;);\n        System.out.println();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>There are different ways to structure it.  In this approach I've repeated the <code>a &lt; 2</code> logic.  Another approach might ask outside the loop then re-ask within the loop, repeating the <code>nextInt()</code> logic.  How you structure it generally comes down to the UX you want in the prompts and personal preference on how to organize the logic.</p>\n<p>But overall the point here is that you want a <em>loop</em>, not <em>recursion</em>.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":17150101,"reputation":61,"user_id":12412231,"display_name":"A-New-User"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1666351159,"creation_date":1666351159,"answer_id":74152876,"question_id":74152081,"body_markdown":"Since none of the above answers are accepted as the answer to your problem, i guess you actually want to work with recursion.

However, this can be configured; lookup the <code>java.security.egd</code> system property, and also the <code>securerandom.source</code> property in the <code>java.security</code> file. The default provider may also be replaced altogether with an alternate implementation that does things differently (and possibly very poorly). See <a href=\"https://security.stackexchange.com/a/14387/655\">this answer</a> for some details. Verifying what random source is indeed used can be a bit complex, but you could try launching your process with <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/1/strace\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">strace</a>, which will show system calls, hence whether <code>/dev/random</code> or <code>/dev/urandom</code> is opened at some point.</p>\n<p>If your Java configuration is fine, <em>and</em> there was no game with VM snapshots, <em>and</em> you are sure that you indeed got the same sequence of UUID as previously, then you really <em>really</em> should have bought a Powerball ticket instead (but I do not honestly believe in this scenario).</p>\n"}],"owner":{"display_name":"PJ1"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":4956,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"answer_count":1,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1666340870,"creation_date":1453908583,"question_id":35050628,"body_markdown":"\r\nWe have observed that set of almost 200,000 UUIDs has replayed two months apart, and I&#39;m wondering if anyone has seen anything similar.\r\n\r\nThe UUIDs are generated using UUID.randomUUID().

Instead, suggestions to improve your code that may or may not fix your problems.\r\n\r\nLet start with &quot;Enemy&quot;. It is OK to have a base &quot;enemy&quot; class that will set default values for the different types of &quot;enemy&quot; characters to use. This is common in games. Characters typically have default parameters and then the specific races or subtypes will add or subtract points based on the attributes of that type. So, let&#39;s do that for &quot;Archer&quot; and &quot;Swordsman&quot;\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Enemy {\r\n\t\r\n\tprotected final String id;\r\n\r\n\tprotected int damage = 10;\r\n\tprotected int hp = 10;\r\n\tprotected int defense = 10;\r\n\tprotected int mana = 10;\r\n\tprotected int speed = 10;\r\n\tprotected int luck = 10;\r\n\t\r\n\tprotected Enemy () {\r\n\t\tRandom rnd = new Random();\r\n\t    int number = rnd.nextInt(99999999);\r\n\t    id = String.format(&quot;%08d&quot;, number);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n    // omitted getters and setters\r\n}\r\n```\r\n----------\r\nI added the final (constant) string field `id` to capture a unique identifier for each instance. I will use this in the subclasses `toString()` method to display the name with the unique identifiers. This way, when displaying the characters, each one will display differently to let you know they are not mere copies of each other.\r\n\r\nYou could redefine all the variables in the subclass like you were attempting to do. For example, you can have `damage` define in both classes, then in the getter method, you can add them together and return the value like this:\r\n```\r\npublic int getDamage () {\r\n    return this.damage + super.damage;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut, why do this? By making the fields in the superclass protected, your subclasses will have direct access to them. If you need to add bonus points to those fields, just add the bonus/penalty points in the constructor.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic final class Swordsman extends Enemy {\r\n\r\n    public static final String NAME = &quot;Swordsman&quot;;\r\n\r\n    public Swordsman() {\r\n        damage += 20; // added 20 points to the default &quot;damage&quot; field value of 10\r\n        // other fields here\r\n    }\r\n    // getters and setters defined in Enemy class\r\n\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic String toString() {\r\n\t\treturn &quot;Swordsman [&quot;+ id + &quot;]&quot;;\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic String getStats() {\r\n\t\treturn NAME + super.getStats();\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is a much cleaner approach because subclasses of `Enemy` need not to redefine what `Enemy` already has. The only thing they need to define is attributes that are unique to their type. For example, maybe you need to define a melee bonus to swordsmen when in close combat, whereas archers may not have melee bonuses. Likewise, archers may have a bonus for ranged attacks whereas swordsmen do not. Those attributes (fields) and methods will need to be added to those classes respectfully.\r\n\r\nWhen running this code using the snippet below\r\n```\r\npublic class Game {\r\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\t\tSwordsman s1 = new Swordsman();\r\n\t\tSwordsman s2 = new Swordsman();\r\n\t\tSwordsman s3 = new Swordsman();\r\n\t\tSwordsman s4 = new Swordsman();\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(s1);\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(s2);\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(s3);\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(s4);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt will display something like this:\r\n```\r\nSwordsman [04923128]\r\nSwordsman [59484796]\r\nSwordsman [11003419]\r\nSwordsman [12543814]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther things to note on my implementation:\r\n\r\n 1. No `static` fields: If you need some attribute to be shared across all instances of a class, then you will need to use static for that. For example, `name` attribute is static in the subclasses. All instances of `Swordsman` class will be labeled &quot;swordsman&quot;. I also made this `final` so that the value of the attribute cannot be changed. Basically, that field is a shared constant.\r\n 2. Fields in the `Enemy` class are protected so that they are accessible by its subclasses.\r\n 3. Swordsman class is `final` so that it cannot be extended. If you need to make a subclass of Swordsman, you will need to remove this qualifier.\r\n 4. Subclass do not need getters and setters. Those should be in the `Enemy` class\r\n\r\nOther things you need to consider, every class should override `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`. Your IDE should be able to generate these for you. If a class don&#39;t add new fields, the subclass will not need to re-override these methods, with the exception of `toString()` because most likely you will want to display the object&#39;s name field value (along with some other stuff like its hash code).\r\n\r\nOne last thing I want to point out in case you didn&#39;t know, which is my guess based on the code you posted. When you use `static` to qualify a field or a method, you are not overriding the field or method. You are essentially creating a new method or field in the subclass with the same name and signature. Remember, static members belong to the class and not the instance. This is another reason you shouldn&#39;t use static in your implementation. For what you are trying to do, it simply does not make any sense to do so.\r\n\r\nOne last, last, thing LOL\r\n\r\nWhy not use Java records for this? Simply because records are immutable and these characters need to be updated constantly (damage during combat, other attributes when leveling up, etc.) For this reason, it is better to use a conventional POJO rather than a Java record. I thought it was important to point this out for anyone who is wondering.","title":"Accessing subclasses from Arraylist","body":"<p>This is not a solution.
