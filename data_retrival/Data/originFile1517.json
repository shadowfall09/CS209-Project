Creating a table with just 2 columns for the sake of compressing an long list of data defeats the purpose of Structure in SQL and you also have to deal with the extra communication overhead.\r\n\r\n**High Level Overview**\r\n\r\nIn your case i am assuming you have an unencrypted text file of 4 million lines where each password is stored in an new line.\r\n\r\n3 simple steps for processing any large amount of sequential data\r\n\r\n**Pagify** :  Divide your file up into chunks or pages. Out of 4 million lines try to process every 100,1000 or N number of lines and write them as seperate chunks inside your file\r\n\r\n**Process** : Processing means taking the above chunks and Compress/Deflate them. \r\n\r\n The java Deflater class has an [setDictionary](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/zip/Deflater.html#setDictionary(byte[])) method where you pass the most frequently occuring byte sequence inside your target chunk which improves overall compression quality. \r\n\r\nFinding what value to pass to this parameter is a little complicated as we will see in the coming sections.\r\n\r\n**Lazy Read** : The problem with your previous approach is you treated your text file as an single unit which you loaded fully into your memory. But now since your file is in chunks we read,check,free each chunk at a time. There are 2 advantages to this approach\r\n\r\n1. After reading an chunk you can free it from memory if it does not match your criteria\r\n\r\n2. If the chunk contains the password you are looking for then you can stop processing there itself and don&#39;t have to process further chunks thus saving computation time . Chunks towards the end of the file can be skipped if what you are looking for is in the beginning of the file.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Test Case**\r\n\r\nI use this code to generate your 4 million lines of text for testing purposes\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception\r\n     {\r\n      try(PrintWriter writer=new PrintWriter(new File(&quot;E:/Passwords.txt&quot;)))\r\n      {\r\n       //for random password generation\r\n       Random random=new Random();\r\n       int \r\n       ch, \r\n       passlength;\r\n       String password;\r\n       \r\n       //4 million lines[comes upto 40MB]\r\n       for(int i=0;i&lt;4 * 1000 * 1000;i++)\r\n       {\r\n        password=&quot;&quot;;\r\n        \r\n        //generate any password whose length is between 5 and 15 characters\r\n        passlength=random.nextInt(5,15);\r\n        for(int j=0;j&lt;passlength;j++)\r\n        {\r\n         //65-&gt;122 is the range of all alphabetic characters in US ASCII\r\n         ch=random.nextInt(65,122);\r\n         \r\n         //exclude characters like [ ( and so on \r\n         if(ch&gt;=91 &amp;&amp; ch&lt;=96){continue;}\r\n         \r\n         password+=(char)(ch);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        //write password to file\r\n        writer.println(password);\r\n       }\r\n      }\r\n     }\r\n\r\nSo we have our test file now lets get started\r\n\r\n**Finding the longest &amp; most frequently occuring string in your list of passwords[Optional operation]**\r\n\r\nAs mentioned the [setDictionary](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/zip/Deflater.html#setDictionary(byte[])) accepts the above required bytes for proper compression. For most of the cases you don&#39;t need to use this as the Compressor most of the time is smart enough to figure this out but if you pass it the exact pattern occurring in your list of passwords then compression speed and performance is improved. Now comes the complicated part\r\n\r\n  **Figuring out the sequence**\r\n  Lets say we have an example string\r\n\r\n      ABC/123/ABC/456/ABC/789\r\n\r\n The most frequently occuring string is /ABC/ including the slashes how we find this string is as follows\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; 1.  Find the length of the longest password in your list which will also be longest word to check for it&#39;s occurence in the list[length call it N]\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 3. Create an for loop n which goes from 2-&gt;N where n is the length of the substring from i-&gt;i+n which we should create and then check for its\r\n&gt; occurence in the password list\r\n\r\nRemember the longer the string we find the better for compression for example lets say we have 2 passwords\r\n\r\n    ABC\r\n    ABCD\r\n\r\n    Longest Password=length 3[2nd line]\r\n\r\n    for i=0-&gt;length of full text\r\n       for n=2-&gt;N\r\n        Generate  substring from i-&gt;i+n\r\n         check for occurences\r\n\r\nFor each of these strings generated we find the number of occurences in the password list and we store the one with the highest occurence.\r\n\r\nBut if we encounter an substring with an longer length than the previous one we override the previous longest word irrespective of its occurences as it is always favoured more in compression\r\n\r\nThe Dictionary class does this\r\n\r\n    import java.util.List;\r\n    import java.util.stream.Collectors;\r\n    \r\n    final class Dictionary\r\n    {\r\n     private static final class Info\r\n     {\r\n      private final int longestLine;\r\n      \r\n      private int highestOccurence;\r\n      private String longestWord=&quot;&quot;;\r\n      \r\n      public Info(int longestLine) {this.longestLine = longestLine;}\r\n     } \r\n     \r\n     private static Info getInfo(List&lt;String&gt; lines)\r\n     {\r\n      int \r\n      currentLine, \r\n      longestLine=0;\r\n      \r\n      for(String line:lines)\r\n      {\r\n       //find longest line in the password list\r\n       if((currentLine=line.length())&gt;longestLine)\r\n       {\r\n        longestLine=currentLine;\r\n       }\r\n      }\r\n      \r\n      return new Info(longestLine);\r\n     }\r\n     \r\n     static String getLongestOccurence(List&lt;String&gt; lines,int minLength,int maxLength)\r\n     {\r\n      //user dosent want dictionary hence return empty string\r\n      if(minLength&lt;0){return &quot;&quot;;}\r\n      \r\n      Info info=getInfo(lines);\r\n     \r\n      minLength=Math.max(2,minLength);\r\n      maxLength=maxLength&lt;=0?info.longestLine:Math.min(maxLength,info.longestLine);\r\n      \r\n      String fullText=lines.stream().collect(Collectors.joining(&quot;\\n&quot;));\r\n      int \r\n      startIndex=0, \r\n      count;\r\n      \r\n      int length=fullText.length();\r\n      outer : for(int i=0;i&lt;length;i++)\r\n      {\r\n       for(int n=minLength;n&lt;maxLength;n++)\r\n       {\r\n        //if substring is longer than text length break\r\n        if((i+n+1)&gt;length){break outer;}\r\n        //if combination length is lesser than previous longestWord length then continue as we dont care about shorter words\r\n        if(n&lt;info.longestWord.length()){continue;}   \r\n        //get combination\r\n        String combination=fullText.substring(i,i+n+1);  \r\n        \r\n        //count occurences\r\n        count=0;\r\n        do\r\n        {\r\n         startIndex=fullText.indexOf(combination,startIndex);\r\n         if(startIndex!=-1)\r\n         {\r\n          startIndex+=combination.length();\r\n          \r\n          count++;\r\n         }\r\n        } \r\n        while(startIndex!=-1);\r\n        \r\n        //we only care about more than one occurences\r\n        if(count&gt;1)\r\n        {   \r\n         if(length&gt;info.longestWord.length()) //if new combination is longer than previous one give it more precedence\r\n         {\r\n          info.longestWord=combination;\r\n          info.highestOccurence=count;\r\n         }\r\n         else if(count&gt;info.highestOccurence)  //else if both are equal length then check counts\r\n         {\r\n          info.longestWord=combination;       \r\n          info.highestOccurence=count;      \r\n         }\r\n        }\r\n       }\r\n      }\r\n      \r\n      return info.longestWord;\r\n     }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  \r\n   \r\n     \r\nHere we are looking for an frequently occuring word which is minimum length 2 and maximum length 4 \r\n\r\n     public static void main(String[] args)\r\n     {\r\n      System.out.println\r\n      (\r\n       &quot;Dictionary=&quot;+Dictionary.getLongestOccurence\r\n       (\r\n        List.of\r\n        (\r\n          &quot;Pass A&quot;\r\n         ,&quot;Pass B&quot;\r\n         ,&quot;Pass C&quot;\r\n         ,&quot;Pass D&quot;\r\n        )\r\n        ,2,4\r\n       )\r\n      );\r\n     }\r\n\r\nWe get\r\n\r\n    Dictionary=Pass\r\n\r\nDifference in compression?\r\n\r\nWith all that complex logic what compression do we get? lets see\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args)throws Exception\r\n     {\r\n      String text=&quot;Pass A\\nPass B\\n Pass C\\nPass D&quot;;\r\n      \r\n      Deflater def=new Deflater(9);\r\n      def.setDictionary(Dictionary.getLongestOccurence(List.of(text),2,6).getBytes());\r\n      \r\n      byte[] original=text.getBytes();\r\n      try(ByteArrayOutputStream baos=new ByteArrayOutputStream())\r\n      {\r\n       try(DeflaterOutputStream dos=new DeflaterOutputStream(baos,def))\r\n       {\r\n        dos.write(original);\r\n        dos.flush();\r\n       }\r\n       System.out.println(original.length+&quot;/&quot;+baos.toByteArray().length);\r\n      }    \r\n     }\r\n    \r\nOutput\r\n\r\n    28/24\r\n\r\nSo using dictionary the ratio of the uncompressed to the compressed data is 28/24\r\n\r\nIf you comment out the line  \r\n`//def.setDictionary(Dictionary.getLongestOccurence(List.of(text),2,6).getBytes());`\r\n\r\nWe get\r\n\r\n        28/26\r\n\r\nNot so great but we saved 2 whole bytes of data by using the dictionary. Off course this is an small test case but if you have sorted your passwords such that very similar passwords are close to each other then savings become much greater.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Pagifying your data[Main Core]**\r\n\r\nThis is the most important part of the operation where all your savings come into play.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s pretty simple as the code will explain it all\r\n\r\n    import java.io.BufferedReader;\r\n    import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;\r\n    import java.io.DataOutputStream;\r\n    import java.io.File;\r\n    import java.io.FileOutputStream;\r\n    import java.io.FileReader;\r\n    import java.util.ArrayList;\r\n    import java.util.stream.Collectors;\r\n    import java.util.zip.Deflater;\r\n    import java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream;\r\n\r\n\r\n    final class Compressor\r\n    {\r\n     public static void compress(File textFile,int linesPerChunk,int minWord,int maxWord,File output)throws Exception\r\n     {\r\n      try(BufferedReader reader=new BufferedReader(new FileReader(textFile));\r\n          FileOutputStream fos=new FileOutputStream(output))\r\n      {\r\n       ArrayList&lt;String&gt; lines=new ArrayList();\r\n       Deflater compresser=new Deflater(9);\r\n       ByteArrayOutputStream baos=new ByteArrayOutputStream();\r\n       DataOutputStream dos=new DataOutputStream(fos);\r\n       int linesDone=0;\r\n       \r\n       String line;   \r\n       while(true)\r\n       {\r\n        line=reader.readLine();\r\n        \r\n        //add only if more input is available\r\n        if(line!=null){lines.add(line);}\r\n    \r\n        //parse if we have linePerChunk number of lines or if this was the last input\r\n        if(line==null || lines.size()&gt;=linesPerChunk)\r\n        {\r\n         //occurs if this was the last input and there are no more left over lines to parse\r\n         if(lines.isEmpty()){break;}\r\n         \r\n         byte[] dictionary=Dictionary.getLongestOccurence(lines,minWord,maxWord).getBytes();\r\n         \r\n         //Compress chunk\r\n         baos.reset();      \r\n         compresser.reset();\r\n         if(dictionary.length!=0){compresser.setDictionary(dictionary);}    \r\n         try(DeflaterOutputStream deos=new DeflaterOutputStream(baos,compresser))\r\n         {\r\n          deos.write(lines.stream().collect(Collectors.joining(&quot;\\n&quot;)).getBytes());\r\n          deos.flush();\r\n         }\r\n         byte[] compressed=baos.toByteArray();\r\n         \r\n         //write chunk\r\n         dos.writeInt(dictionary.length);\r\n         dos.write(dictionary);\r\n         dos.writeInt(compressed.length);\r\n         dos.write(compressed);\r\n         dos.flush();\r\n         \r\n         System.out.println(&quot;Compressed Lines=&quot;+(linesDone+=lines.size()));\r\n         \r\n         //clear to read next chunk\r\n         lines.clear();\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n       \r\n        if(line==null){break;}\r\n       }\r\n       \r\n       //used while reading to check for end point\r\n       dos.writeInt(-1);\r\n      }\r\n     }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBasically we divide your file into pages of N lines and compress each page and write it as a chunk into an new file. This method also accepts the min and max word length to use in your dictionary . You can pass -1 for either value if you wish to skip using dictionary. Performance benefits of dictionary largely depends on your password data and is your preference\r\n\r\n**Lazy Reading[Final]**\r\n\r\nFinally we read each chunk and if the chunk contains the password we are looking for we return the method there only and don&#39;t proceed further\r\n\r\n    public class Validater \r\n    {\r\n     public static boolean isAllowed(String password,File compressed)throws Exception\r\n     {\r\n      Inflater inf=new Inflater();\r\n      ByteArrayOutputStream baos=new ByteArrayOutputStream();\r\n      \r\n      try(DataInputStream dis=new DataInputStream(new FileInputStream(compressed));)\r\n      {\r\n       int size;\r\n       while((size=dis.readInt())!=-1)\r\n       {\r\n         byte[] dictionary=new byte[size];\r\n         dis.read(dictionary);\r\n         byte[] data=new byte[dis.readInt()];\r\n         dis.read(data);\r\n    \r\n         inf.reset();\r\n         try(InflaterInputStream iis=new InflaterInputStream(new ByteArrayInputStream(data),inf))\r\n         {\r\n          baos.reset();\r\n          \r\n          int length;\r\n          byte[] output=new byte[1000];

All the classes used here are all present in java 7 except streams which is java 8  which most android versions support so you should be ok on that end. If you cant be bothered to read my poorly documented explanations then you can go right ahead and copy the full code after the FullCode Section. This took pretty much the whole day. One down side is while before your compressed file was 11 MB the final compressed file in my system came up to 26.9 MB. for my randomly generated passwords but as you have seen from the outputs memory and speed is overall very good. You can play around with the settings to get your preferred sizes Also if you have a better approach for finding the dictionary please do edit this answer. Don&#39;t bother using SqLite. \r\n\r\nYou have a good day now :)   \r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\nDictionary class is much faster and improved. Hope it helps","title":"Optimize SQLITE to store large number of words","body":"<p>Dont use sqlite or any database for your purpose.

But now since your file is in chunks we read,check,free each chunk at a time. There are 2 advantages to this approach</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>After reading an chunk you can free it from memory if it does not match your criteria</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If the chunk contains the password you are looking for then you can stop processing there itself and don't have to process further chunks thus saving computation time .

All the classes used here are all present in java 7 except streams which is java 8  which most android versions support so you should be ok on that end. If you cant be bothered to read my poorly documented explanations then you can go right ahead and copy the full code after the FullCode Section. This took pretty much the whole day. One down side is while before your compressed file was 11 MB the final compressed file in my system came up to 26.9 MB. for my randomly generated passwords but as you have seen from the outputs memory and speed is overall very good. You can play around with the settings to get your preferred sizes Also if you have a better approach for finding the dictionary please do edit this answer. Don't bother using SqLite.</p>\n<p>You have a good day now :)</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>\nDictionary class is much faster and improved.

The row in the C table should have the discriminator field that tells JPA what type of data it is (pure C, B or A data)."},{"owner":{"account_id":22174436,"reputation":1,"user_id":16419235,"display_name":"jcf"},"score":0,"creation_date":1647508262,"post_id":71476292,"comment_id":126390407,"body_markdown":"OK,Thank you very much.Your answer is of great reference significance.","body":"OK,Thank you very much.Your answer is of great reference significance."}],"owner":{"account_id":22174436,"reputation":1,"user_id":16419235,"display_name":"jcf"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":80,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1647310613,"creation_date":1647310613,"question_id":71476292,"body_markdown":"About the use of JPA in springboot, there are three tables A, B and C. table A inherits table B, and table B inherits table C. when querying the data with the findAll() function of JpaRepository query statement of table B, it is found that the data found in table B will be automatically converted to the type of table A, and the field clazz_ that cannot be found will appear when querying the data with SQL Question of table B.(The simple generalization is that the result set queried by the jparepository of the parent table is automatically mapped to the smallest subclass type)","title":"When spring boot uses JPA, multi table inheritance leads to inconsistent result set types?","body":"<p>About the use of JPA in springboot, there are three tables A, B and C. table A inherits table B, and table B inherits table C. when querying the data with the findAll() function of JpaRepository query statement of table B, it is found that the data found in table B will be automatically converted to the type of table A, and the field clazz_ that cannot be found will appear when querying the data with SQL Question of table B.(The simple generalization is that the result set queried by the jparepository of the parent table is automatically mapped to the smallest subclass type)</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","collections","java-8","java-stream","collectors"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":14179476,"reputation":2663,"user_id":10243634,"display_name":"Oboe"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1647279706,"creation_date":1647279706,"answer_id":71472034,"question_id":71471395,"body_markdown":"You can create a method that adds two `DTO`:\r\n\r\n    private static DTO add(DTO dto1, DTO dto2) {\r\n        BigDecimal bd1 = new BigDecimal(dto1.getValue());\r\n        BigDecimal bd2 = new BigDecimal(dto2.getValue());\r\n        return new DTO(dto1.getId(), dto1.getYear(), bd1.add(bd2).toString());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen you can `stream` grouping by `id` and reduce using the previous method:\r\n\r\n    private static List&lt;DTO&gt;

Ensure that you are using the most recent stable version of Idea (currently 2021.3.2), Java and JavaFX (currently 17.0.2). \r\n 2. Discard your current project.  \r\n 3. Create a new project. \r\n     * Follow the instructions at [Create a new JavaFX project][1] provided by Idea on how to use their wizard. \r\n     * If you follow the instructions exactly it should work. \r\n 4. You don&#39;t need to add &quot;the Java FX lib&quot; to the project manually.\r\n     * The wizard will create a dependency in Maven or Gradle which includes the most common JavaFX modules.\r\n     * You don&#39;t need to download or use the JavaFX SDK mentioned at openjfx.io.\r\n 5.  You don&#39;t need to explicitly set any VM arguments such as `--add-modules` the wizard will create the a `module-info.java` file which references the modules. \r\n\r\nBefore proceeding any further, make sure that the basic generated project build and runs in your environment (according to the build and execution instructions documented by IntelliJ for the new JavaFX project wizard).\r\n\r\n**Using additional JavaFX modules**\r\n\r\nIf you want to use additional JavaFX modules (e.g. javafx.media or javafx.web):\r\n\r\n 1. Add the additional modules manually to the maven or gradle build file. \r\n 2. Reimport the build file into the Idea project.\r\n 3. Add requires clauses form the modules to the module-info.java.\r\n\r\n**Making your application non-modular**\r\n\r\nEven if your application is made non-modular, you still need to have JavaFX modules on the module path as that is the only way the execution of JavaFX is supported.\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t want a modular application, you can delete the module-info.java file and manually add VM arguments for the module path to the JavaFX and an `--add-modules` switch. \r\n\r\nI do not advise doing this step unless:\r\n\r\n * You have a good reason not to have a non-modular application (e.g. rely on 3rd party dependencies which do not integrate easily with the Java module system), AND\r\n * You have knowledge about how to make non-modular JavaFX applications.\r\n\r\n**Cause of the module find exception**\r\n\r\nThe reason for your specific error:\r\n\r\n    java.lang.module.FindException: Module com.example.hudrava_test not found\r\n\r\nis because you don&#39;t have `module-info.java` for a module with that name on the module path.  Note that is not a JavaFX module name, but something you have specified.  You have tried to run the application by specifying a class name within the non-existent module, e.g. \r\n\r\n    java --module-path &lt;somepath&gt; -m com.example.hudrava_test/com.example.hudrava_test.HelloApplication\r\n\r\nYou can find out further info about that in:\r\n\r\n * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66855489/java-lang-module-findexception-module-not-found.  \r\n\r\nHowever, you should not need to manually take the steps outlined in that answer, because, when you create a new project using the new JavaFX wizard, it will automatically create a module-info.java file and place your application&#39;s build output on the modulepath.  \r\n\r\nSo the error was caused by something you did after creating the project with the wizard (I don&#39;t know what).

What can I do to prevent this/ work around this?","title":"Why does PBEWithMD5AndDES mess up encryption in parallelStream in Java?","body":"<p>I am working in a Spring Boot project where we use the PBEWithMD5AndDES encryption algorithm. We use the\n<code>javax.crypto.Cipher</code> class library like the code below. When we process single requests it works fine, but in a new feature we need our server to handle many encryptions at once, which is making it sometimes encrypt it wrongly. Through debugging I have discovered that the messed up encryption happens at <code>com.sun.crypto.provider.CipherBlockChaining#implEncrypt()</code>. It usually begins correctly but at some point starts to give unexpected outputs for the same input.

They are expected to be present in every map and each of them expected to have a specific range of values, although are stored as strings according to your example. \r\n\r\n***Side-note:** avoid using row types (like `Map` without generic information in angle brackets `&lt;&gt;`), in such a case all elements inside a collection will be treated as `Object`s.*\r\n\r\n`Item` clearly has to be defined as a **class**. By storing these data inside a *map*, you&#39;re loosing a possibility to define an **appropriate data type** for each *property*, and also you&#39;re not able to **define behaviour** to manipulate with these *properties* (*for more elaborate explanation take a look at [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71113033/17949945)*).\r\n```\r\npublic class Item {\r\n    private final String itemNumber;\r\n    private Set&lt;Subtype&gt; subtypes;\r\n    private long quantity;\r\n\r\n    public Item combine(Item other) {\r\n        Set&lt;Subtype&gt; combinedSubtypes = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(subtypes);\r\n        combinedSubtypes.addAll(other.subtypes);\r\n\r\n        return new Item(this.itemNumber,\r\n                        combinedSubtypes,\r\n                        this.quantity + other.quantity);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // + constructor, getters, hashCode/equals, toString\r\n}\r\n```\r\nMethod `combine` represents the logic for merging two items together. By placing it inside this **class**, you could easily reuse and change it when needed.\r\n\r\nThe best choice for the type of the `subtype` field is an [**enum**](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html). Because it&#39;ll allow to *avoid mistakes* caused by misspelled string values and also **enum**s have an extensive language support (`switch` *expressions* and *statements*, special *data structures* designed especially for *enums*, *enum* could be used with *annotations*).\r\n\r\nThis custom **enum** can look like this.\r\n```\r\npublic enum Subtype {DAIRY, FRESH}\r\n```\r\nWith all these changes, the code inside the `mergeInventoryPerItemNumber()` becomes concise and easier to comprehend. `Collectors.groupingBy()` is used to create a map by grouping *items* with the same `itemNumber`. A downstream collector `Collectors.reducing()` is used to combine *items* grouped under the same *key* to a *single object*.\r\n\r\nNote that `Collectors.reducing()` produces an `Optional` result. Therefore, `filter(Optional::isPresent)` is used as a precaution to make sure that the result exists and subsequent operation `map(Optional::get)` extracts the **item** from the *optional object*.   \r\n\r\n    public static Collection&lt;Item&gt; mergeInventoryPerItemNumber(Collection&lt;Item&gt; inventory) {\r\n        return inventory.stream()\r\n                .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Item::getItemNumber,\r\n                                Collectors.reducing(Item::combine)))\r\n                .values().stream()\r\n                .filter(Optional::isPresent)\r\n                .map(Optional::get)\r\n                .collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**main()**\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        List&lt;Item&gt; inventory =\r\n                List.of(new Item(&quot;EU999&quot;, Set.of(Subtype.DAIRY), 60),\r\n                        new Item(&quot;EU999&quot;, Set.of(Subtype.DAIRY), 1000),\r\n                        new Item(&quot;EU999&quot;, Set.of(Subtype.FRESH), 800),\r\n                        new Item(&quot;EU100&quot;, Set.of(Subtype.FRESH), 100));\r\n\r\n        Collection&lt;Item&gt; combinedItems = mergeInventoryPerItemNumber(inventory);\r\n\r\n        combinedItems.forEach(System.out::println);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Output**\r\n```\r\nItem{itemNumber=&#39;EU100&#39;, subtypes=[FRESH], quantity=100}\r\nItem{itemNumber=&#39;EU999&#39;, subtypes=[FRESH, DAIRY], quantity=1860}\r\n```","title":"How to merge two Maps based on values with Java 8 streams?","body":"<p>You are misusing a <code>Map</code> here.

By storing these data inside a <em>map</em>, you're loosing a possibility to define an <strong>appropriate data type</strong> for each <em>property</em>, and also you're not able to <strong>define behaviour</strong> to manipulate with these <em>properties</em> (<em>for more elaborate explanation take a look at <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/71113033/17949945\">this answer</a></em>).</p>\n<pre><code>public class Item {\n    private final String itemNumber;\n    private Set&lt;Subtype&gt; subtypes;\n    private long quantity;\n\n    public Item combine(Item other) {\n        Set&lt;Subtype&gt; combinedSubtypes = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(subtypes);\n        combinedSubtypes.addAll(other.subtypes);\n\n        return new Item(this.itemNumber,\n                        combinedSubtypes,\n                        this.quantity + other.quantity);\n    }\n\n    // + constructor, getters, hashCode/equals, toString\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Method <code>combine</code> represents the logic for merging two items together. By placing it inside this <strong>class</strong>, you could easily reuse and change it when needed.</p>\n<p>The best choice for the type of the <code>subtype</code> field is an <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>enum</strong></a>. Because it'll allow to <em>avoid mistakes</em> caused by misspelled string values and also <strong>enum</strong>s have an extensive language support (<code>switch</code> <em>expressions</em> and <em>statements</em>, special <em>data structures</em> designed especially for <em>enums</em>, <em>enum</em> could be used with <em>annotations</em>).</p>\n<p>This custom <strong>enum</strong> can look like this.</p>\n<pre><code>public enum Subtype {DAIRY, FRESH}\n</code></pre>\n<p>With all these changes, the code inside the <code>mergeInventoryPerItemNumber()</code> becomes concise and easier to comprehend. <code>Collectors.groupingBy()</code> is used to create a map by grouping <em>items</em> with the same <code>itemNumber</code>.
