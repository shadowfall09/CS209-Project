Generics is, in essence, &quot;compiler checked documentation&quot;. It&#39;s a way to get both of these things at the same time:\r\n\r\n* You have a method that returns, say, a List. You&#39;d like to document that the list only contains strings.\r\n* You&#39;d like for the compiler to be aware of this and tell users who treat that list as if it contains something other than strings to go: &quot;Hey, there - hang on. I don&#39;t think you understand how this method works, given that you appear to be treating it as if it has non-strings in it, which it won&#39;t, as the documentation says that it won&#39;t&quot;. Or vice versa: &quot;Hey there - hang on. You documented that the list you return only contain strings but you appear to be attempting to stuff a number in there. That doesn&#39;t make sense. I shall not compile this inconsistency until you fix it&quot;.\r\n\r\nAnd very much in last place, generics makes your code very slightly shorter, as the compiler will inserts casts for you silently. When the method is documented to return only a list of strings, when you call that method and then call `.get(0)` on the result, the compiler &quot;pre-casts&quot; it to a String for you.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s it. It doesn&#39;t change anything at runtime. Those casts are even generated by the compiler.\r\n\r\nSo, how does it work:\r\n\r\n* In _signatures_, generics is compiled into the class file, but the JVM treats these as effectively &#39;a comment&#39; - the JVM completely ignores them. The point of this is solely for the benefit of `javac`, who can read these comments and act accordingly. In other words, the fact that `ArrayList` has generics needs to be known by `javac` in order to properly compile the line `new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;()` - and how does `javac` know? By checking the class file that contains the ArrayList code. Signatures are:\r\n\r\n  * The name of a class.\r\n  * The `extends` and `implements` clauses of a class.\r\n  * The type of every field, and the name of every field.\r\n  * The return type of every method, and the name of every method.\r\n  * The type (not name) of every parameter of a method.\r\n  * The throws clause of a method.\r\n\r\nEverywhere else, generics just __disappear__. So, if you write inside a method: `List&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();`, the code you end up with is _JUST_ `new ArrayList()` in the class file. That string is just __gone__. It also explains why given a `List&lt;?&gt; x;` there is simply no way to ask this list: What is your component type. Because it is no longer available at runtime.\r\n\r\n* Javac uses this information to figure out what to do.\r\n* For the purposes of compilation, _ALL_ generics-typed stuff is compiled as if they are their _lower bound_.\r\n\r\n## What about generic casts?\r\n\r\nThe closest other java language feature to a generic cast is `@SuppressWarnings`. A generic cast does __literally nothing__. It&#39;s just you telling the compiler: Shut up, I know what I&#39;m doing (hence, you best really know what you are doing to use them!!).\r\n\r\nFor example, given:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid foo(List&lt;?&gt; x) {\r\n  List&lt;String&gt; y = (List&lt;String&gt;) x;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe compiler __does nothing__. There is no way for the compiler to generate code that actually checks if `x` really is a List&lt;String&gt;. The above code __cannot__ throw an exception, even if there are non-strings in that list. As I said before, generics also cause the compiler to inject casts. So, if you later write:\r\n\r\n```\r\nx.get(0).toLowerCase();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat will compile (there is no need to cast `x.get(0)` to String, however, it is compiled that way!) - and if you pass a list to this method that has a non-string object as first item, that line throws a `ClassCastException` even though you didn&#39;t write any casts on that line. That&#39;s because the compiler inserted a cast for you.\r\n\r\n## Think about it like this: Generics are for linking types in signatures.\r\n\r\nImagine you want to write a method that logs its argument and then just returns it. That&#39;s all it does.\r\n\r\nYou want to now &#39;link&#39; the type of the argument to the return type: You want to tell the compiler and all users of this method: Whatever type you feed into this method is identical to the type that rolls of it.\r\n\r\nIn normal java you cannot do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nObject log(Object o) {\r\n  log.mark(&quot;Logged: {}&quot;, o);\r\n   return o;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above works fine but is annoying to use. I can&#39;t do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  String y = scanner.next();\r\n  new URL(log(y)).openConnection();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason I can&#39;t do that, is the `log(y)` expression is of type `Object`, and the URL constructor requires a String. Us humans can _clearly_ see that `log(y)` is obviously going to return a string, but the _signature_ of the `log` method doesn&#39;t indicate this at all. We have to look at the implementation of `log` to know this, and perhaps tomorrow this implementation changes. The `log` method does not indicate that any future updates will continue to just &#39;return the parameter&#39; like this. So javac __does not let you write this code__.\r\n\r\nBut now we add generics:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic &lt;T&gt; T log(T o) {\r\n log.mark(&quot;Logged: {}&quot;, o);\r\n return o;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now it works fine. We&#39;ve told the compiler that there exists a link between the 2 places we used `T` in this code: The caller gets to choose what T ends up being, and the compiler ensures that no matter what the caller chose, your code works.\r\n\r\nHence, if you define a type parameter and use it exactly 0 or 1 times, it&#39;s virtually always either a bug or a weird hack. The point is to link things and &#39;0 or 1 times&#39; is obviously not linking things.\r\n\r\nGenerics goes much further than this, your question&#39;s scope is far too broad. If you want to know every detail, read the Java Lang Spec, which gets into hopeless amounts of detail that will take your 6 months to even understand. There&#39;s no real point to this. You don&#39;t need to know the chemical composition of brake fluid to drive a car either.\r\n","title":"Generic working : compile time vs runtime","body":"<p>Mostly, generics just disappear entirely at runtime.

I haven't\nhad any luck with doreso which has left me with Gracenote and ACRCloud\nwhich have free trials or free accounts but those come with limitations.\nI am not exactly looking to spend a lot of money in order to get this to\nwork, so my options seem to be diminishing. When I used the echoprint\ncode tutorial above, I was able to get it to work and when I tested it,\nit seemed to be working but since the echoprint api is no longer\navailable I was not able to get any results only codegens. I do not have\nenough of an understanding of gracenote or acrcloud to implement them\ninto my app. I tried working with the provided sdks and web api's with no\nluck.</p>\n<p>For gracenote whenever I did a query with the echoprint codegen I got a\nlogcat error about not having permission to access the page/site. I looked\ninto it and it seemed that I needed to incorporate some sort  of user\naccess in xml within the app and it shouldn't be available for users to\nsee as it would contain my client ID. I do not know how to do this and\nthe documentation wasn't very helpful for me. Similar situation with\nacrcloud but without the xml user access portion.</p>\n<p>That being said, my question is how would I go about implementing my own echoprint server or fingerprinting server that communicates with my app. Would I need services such as google cloud platform/amazon web service?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","selenium","cucumber-java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2366187,"reputation":60152,"user_id":2071828,"accept_rate":88,"display_name":"Boris the Spider"},"score":0,"creation_date":1650108849,"post_id":71893501,"comment_id":127041584,"body_markdown":"Dependency ordering between scenarios isn’t great - and usually unsupported.

In fact, a client should not be aware nor bothered with the internal implementation details of something to make it work.</p>\n<pre><code>\n//Test class\npublic class Test {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Node root = new Node(1, &quot;test1&quot;, new Node[]{\n                new Node(2, &quot;test2&quot;, new Node[]{\n                        new Node(5, &quot;test6&quot;, new Node[]{})\n                }),\n                new Node(3, &quot;test3&quot;, new Node[]{\n                        new Node(6, &quot;test6&quot;, new Node[]{}),\n                        new Node(7, &quot;test7&quot;, new Node[]{\n                                new Node(8, &quot;test8&quot;, new Node[]{})\n                        })\n                }),\n                new Node(4, &quot;test4&quot;, new Node[]{})\n        });\n\n        root.print();\n    }\n}\n\nclass Node {\n\n    int value;\n    String name;\n    Node parent;\n    int childrenCount;\n    Node[] children = new Node[100];\n\n    public Node(int value, String name) {\n        this.value = value;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.childrenCount = 0;\n    }\n\n    //Added second constructor only to ease the test\n    public Node(int value, String name, Node[] children) {\n        this.value = value;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.children = children;\n        this.childrenCount = getNumChildren(children);\n    }\n\n    public Node(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    //Fixed possible exception when added more than 100 elements\n    public boolean addChildren(Node node) {\n        if (childrenCount == this.children.length) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        this.children[childrenCount++] = node;\n        return true;\n    }\n\n    public void setParent(Node parent) {\n        this.parent = parent;\n    }\n\n    public boolean hasParent() {\n        return this.parent != null;\n    }\n\n    public int sumValue() {\n        int sum = 0;\n        sum += this.value;\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; childrenCount; i++) {\n            sum += children[i].value;\n        }\n        return sum;\n    }\n\n    //small utility method only to compute the effective number of children when an array is passed within the new constructor\n    public static int getNumChildren(Node[] children) {\n        int num = 0;\n        while (num &lt; children.length &amp;&amp; children[num] != null) {\n            num++;\n        }\n        return num;\n    }\n\n    //print method invoked by the client of the class\n    public void print() {\n        printRec(this, 0);\n    }\n\n    //recursive print\n    private void printRec(Node n, int numCall) {\n        //identifying the base case\n        if (n == null) {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        //Printing as many dahses as the depth of the current child node\n        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= numCall; i++) {\n            System.out.print(&quot;--&quot;);\n        }\n\n        //printing the node info\n        System.out.println(n.name + &quot; (&quot; + n.value + &quot;)&quot;);\n\n        //recursively invoking the print method for each child\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; n.childrenCount; i++) {\n            printRec(n.children[i], numCall + 1);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here I just wanted to add a couple of side notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>children is already the plural form of child.
