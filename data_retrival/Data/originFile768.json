Think of it like this: <code>switch (expr)</code> evaluates <code>expr</code>. Each <code>case</code> tests the result of the evaluation. Your <code>summer</code> in example 2 is similar to trying to test <code>&quot;March,April,May,June,July&quot; == 1</code>. That doesn&#39;t makes sense, since <code>summer</code> is a <code>String</code> and <code>1</code> is an <code>int</code> literal. The same objection applies to <code>winter</code> and <code>rainy</code>."},{"owner":{"account_id":25847010,"reputation":29,"user_id":19581679,"display_name":"data2quest"},"score":0,"creation_date":1672402768,"post_id":74956718,"comment_id":132283202,"body_markdown":"@Turing85, computerguy, Old Dog Programmer - Many thanks for the great explanation from one and all","body":"@Turing85, computerguy, Old Dog Programmer - Many thanks for the great explanation from one and all"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":23959668,"reputation":26587,"user_id":17949945,"display_name":"Alexander Ivanchenko"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1672362132,"creation_date":1672361493,"answer_id":74957272,"question_id":74956718,"body_markdown":"&gt;

The objects are cheap to collect and the overheads of JFR will typically not exceed 1%.\r\n\r\nThis may not be sufficient to find the memory leak, in which case a stack trace can be collected with each sample. This can be very useful if the memory leak is in an ArrayList or HashMap as they contain an internal array that is (re)allocated as the collection grows, which means that the code path that added the leaking object to the collection can usually be seen.\r\n\r\nIn JDK 17, or later, stack traces can be enabled with:\r\n\r\n    $ java -XX:StartFlightRecording:memory-leak=stack-traces ...\r\n\r\nIn releases prior to JDK 17, it&#39;s easiest to enable stack traces by using the profile configuration:\r\n\r\n    $ java -XX:StartFlightRecording:settings=profile ...\r\n\r\nCollecting stack traces is more expensive and could in some circumstances increase the CPU usage above 1%. \r\n\r\nFinally, it&#39;s possible to also collect the shortest path to the GC roots, which will contain reference that shouldn&#39;t be there.\r\n\r\nIn JDK 17, or later, path to gc roots can be enabled with:\r\n\r\n    $ java -XX:StartFlightRecording:memory-leaks=gc-roots ...\r\n\r\nIn releases prior to JDK 17:\r\n\r\n    $ java -XX:StartFlightRecording:settings=profile,path-to-gc-roots=true ...\r\n\r\nThis will introduce a stop-the-world pause at the end of the recording. It could potentially block the application for several seconds while JFR traverses the heap. The amount of data written to disk is however small, typically not more than a few MB.\r\n\r\nThe object samples are spread in time. The samples taken at the beginning are objects created during initialization, for example, singleton objects. Objects at the end are often short-lived objects that will soon be garbage collected.

This can be very useful if the memory leak is in an ArrayList or HashMap as they contain an internal array that is (re)allocated as the collection grows, which means that the code path that added the leaking object to the collection can usually be seen.</p>\n<p>In JDK 17, or later, stack traces can be enabled with:</p>\n<pre><code>$ java -XX:StartFlightRecording:memory-leak=stack-traces ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>In releases prior to JDK 17, it's easiest to enable stack traces by using the profile configuration:</p>\n<pre><code>$ java -XX:StartFlightRecording:settings=profile ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Collecting stack traces is more expensive and could in some circumstances increase the CPU usage above 1%.</p>\n<p>Finally, it's possible to also collect the shortest path to the GC roots, which will contain reference that shouldn't be there.</p>\n<p>In JDK 17, or later, path to gc roots can be enabled with:</p>\n<pre><code>$ java -XX:StartFlightRecording:memory-leaks=gc-roots ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>In releases prior to JDK 17:</p>\n<pre><code>$ java -XX:StartFlightRecording:settings=profile,path-to-gc-roots=true ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>This will introduce a stop-the-world pause at the end of the recording.

Swing was designed to be used with <code>Key Bindings</code>. There is no need to set the root pane opaque or the &quot;pane&quot; non-opaque. As I mention in one of your previous questions you don&#39;t need the ImageObserver. ImageIO returns a BufferedImage, so you can just use the getWidth() and getHeight() methods of that class."},{"owner":{"account_id":27352183,"reputation":1,"user_id":20861170,"display_name":"Alex654"},"score":0,"creation_date":1672377586,"post_id":74958069,"comment_id":132278278,"body_markdown":"I&#39;ve read the text.
