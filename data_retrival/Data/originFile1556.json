Phase 1: Identify Matching Arity Methods Applicable by Strict Invocation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.12.2.2)\r\n--\r\n&gt; An argument expression is considered pertinent to applicability for a potentially applicable method m unless it has one of the following forms:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; […]\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; * An inexact method reference expression ([&#167;15.13.1][2]).\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; […]\r\n\r\nThis is the only bullet point in this list that could potentially match, however, as pointed in the question we have an _exact_ method reference expression here. Note that if you remove the `&lt;Void&gt;`, this makes it an inexact method reference, and both methods should be applicable as per the next section:\r\n\r\n&gt; Let `m` be a potentially applicable method (&#167;15.12.2.1) with arity *n* and formal parameter types `F`&lt;sub&gt;`1`&lt;/sub&gt; ... `F`&lt;sub&gt;`n`&lt;/sub&gt;, and let `e`&lt;sub&gt;`1`&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., `e`&lt;sub&gt;`n`&lt;/sub&gt; be the actual argument expressions of the method invocation. Then: \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; […]\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; * If `m` is not a generic method, then `m` is applicable by strict invocation if, for 1 ≤ *i* ≤ *n*, either `e`&lt;sub&gt;`i`&lt;/sub&gt; is compatible in a strict invocation context with `F`&lt;sub&gt;`i`&lt;/sub&gt; or `e`&lt;sub&gt;`i`&lt;/sub&gt; is not pertinent to applicability.\r\n\r\nHowever only the first `funct()` method declaration should be applicable by strict invocation. Strict invocation contexts are defined [here][3], but basically they check if the type of the expression matches the type of the argument. Here the type of our argument, the method reference, is defined by section [15.13.2. Type of a Method Reference][4] whose relevant part is:\r\n\r\n&gt; A method reference expression is compatible in an assignment context, invocation context, or casting context with a target type T if T is a functional interface type ([&#167;9.8][5]) and the expression is congruent with the [function type][6] of […] T.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; […]\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; A method reference expression is *congruent* with a function type if both of the following are true:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; * The function type identifies a single compile-time declaration corresponding to the reference.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; * One of the following is true:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;   * The result of the function type is `void`.\r\n&gt;   * The result of the function type is R, and the result of applying capture conversion ([&#167;5.1.10][7]) to the return type of the invocation type ([&#167;15.12.2.6][8]) of the chosen compile-time declaration is R&#39; (where R is the target type that may be used to infer R&#39;), and neither R nor R&#39; is `void`, and R&#39; is compatible with R in an assignment context.\r\n\r\nHere R would be `Integer` for `Functional1` and `String` for `Functional2`, while `R&#39;` is `Integer` in both cases (since there is no capture conversion needed for `ImplementingClass.hitIt()`), so clearly the method reference is not *congruent* with `Functional2` and by extension not compatible.\r\n\r\n`funct(Functional2)` should thus not be considered for applicability by strict invocation, and since only `funct(Functional1)` remains it should be selected.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that Javac must select both methods in Phase 1, because only one phase can apply, and Phase 2 only uses _loose context_ instead of _strict_, which just allows boxing operations, and Phase 3 then includes varargs, which is not applicable either.\r\n\r\nExcept if we consider that Javac somehow considers the method reference as congruent with `Functional2`, the only reason I see for selecting both methods is if it considered the method reference as _not pertinent for applicability_ as specified above, which I can only explain if the compiler considers it as an inexact method reference.\r\n\r\n[15.12.2.5. Choosing the Most Specific Method][9]\r\n--\r\nThis is where the compilation fails. We should note that there is nothing here that would make the compiler select one method over the other. The applicable rule is:\r\n\r\n&gt; * m2 is not generic, and m1 and m2 are applicable by strict or loose invocation, and where m1 has formal parameter types S1, ..., Sn and m2 has formal parameter types T1, ..., Tn, the type Si is more specific than Ti for argument ei for all i (1 ≤ i ≤ n, n = k).\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; […]\r\n&gt;  A type S is more specific than a type T for any expression if S &lt;: T ([&#167;4.10][10]).\r\n\r\nThis appears to work properly: change `Functional2` to extend `Functional1` and it will compile.\r\n\r\n&gt;  A functional interface type S is more specific than a functional interface type T for an expression e if T is not a subtype of S and one of the following is true (where U1 ... Uk and R1 are the parameter types and return type of the function type of the capture of S, and V1 ... Vk and R2 are the parameter types and return type of the function type of T): \r\n&gt; * If e is an explicitly typed lambda expression […]\r\n&gt; * If e is an exact method reference expression (&#167;15.13.1), then i) for all i (1 ≤ i ≤ k), Ui is the same as Vi, and ii) one of the following is true: \r\n&gt;    * R2 is void.\r\n&gt;    * R1 &lt;: R2.\r\n&gt;    * […]\r\n\r\nThis does not allow to disambiguate it either. However, changing `Functional2.hitIt()` to return `Number` should make `Functional1` more specific since `Integer &lt;: Number`.\r\n\r\nThis still fails, which seems to confirm that the compiler does not consider it as an exact method reference.\r\n\r\nNote that removing the `&lt;T&gt;` in `ImplementingClass.hitIt()` allows it to compile, independently of the return type of `Functional2.hitIt()`. Fun fact: you can leave the `&lt;Void&gt;` at the call site, the compiler ignores it.\r\n\r\nEven stranger: if you leave the `&lt;T&gt;` and add more type arguments than required at the call site, the compiler still complains about the ambiguous call and not about the number of type arguments (until you remove the ambiguity). Not that this should make the method reference inexact, based on the above definition, but I would think [it should be checked first][2].\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n--\r\n\r\nSince the Eclipse compiler accepts it, I would tend to consider this as a Javac bug, but note that the Eclipse compiler is sometimes more lenient than Javac with respect to the specs, and some similar bugs have been reported and closed ([JDK-8057895][11], [JDK-8170842][12], …).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.13\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.13.1\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.3\r\n  [4]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.13.2\r\n  [5]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.8\r\n  [6]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.9\r\n  [7]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.10\r\n  [8]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.12.2.6\r\n  [9]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.12.2.5\r\n  [10]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.10\r\n  [11]: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8057895\r\n  [12]: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8170842","title":"Conditions for Method Reference Expression to be &quot;exact&quot;","body":"<p>First a warning: IANAJL (IANAL for Java 😉)</p>\n<p>As far as I can tell, this should compile if you make the two interface methods non-generic, but it doesn’t.

A class was missing, so I couldn&#39;t see what your GUI looks like.\r\n\r\nSo I created this GUI.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nI left off the loyalty card button.\r\n\r\n# Explanation\r\n\r\nOracle has a helpful tutorial, [Creating a GUI With Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/index.html).  Skip the Learning Swing with the NetBeans IDE section. \r\n\r\nI use the [model-view-controller][2] (MVC) pattern when creating a Swing application.  The name implies that you create the model first, then the view, then the controller.\r\n\r\nThe application model consists of one or more plain Java getter/setter classes.\r\n\r\nThe view consists of one `JFrame`, one or more `JPanels`, and Swing components.\r\n\r\nEach `Action` or `ActionListener` class makes up the controller.  There&#39;s usually not one controller to &quot;rule them all&quot;.\r\n\r\n## Model\r\n\r\nThe first model class I created is the `Item` class.  The `Item` class holds a name and a price.  The price is specified in pence.  Using an int field to hold the price makes the calculations easier.  I translate the pence into pounds when displaying the prices.\r\n\r\nThe second model class I created is the `VendingMachineModel` class. The `VendingMachineModel` class holds a `java.util.List` of items, a `java.util.List` of coins, an `int` balance field, and an `int` change field. \r\n\r\n## View\r\n\r\nYour view was easy to follow and well structured, so I don&#39;t have a lot of comments here.  I used a `ButtonGroup` to limit the `JRadioButtons` to one selection.\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t make all the Swing components class fields.  It&#39;s confusing for readers of your code.  Class fields should only be used for fields needed in more than one method.\r\n\r\nOrder your methods within a class from the most important method to the least important methods.  This makes the code easier for people to read and understand.\r\n\r\n## Controller\r\n\r\nI used lambda expressions for all the `JButtons` except the purchase button.

A class was missing, so I couldn't see what your GUI looks like.</p>\n<p>So I created this GUI.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bidQm.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bidQm.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>I left off the loyalty card button.</p>\n<h1>Explanation</h1>\n<p>Oracle has a helpful tutorial, <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Creating a GUI With Swing</a>.  Skip the Learning Swing with the NetBeans IDE section.</p>\n<p>I use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">model-view-controller</a> (MVC) pattern when creating a Swing application.  The name implies that you create the model first, then the view, then the controller.</p>\n<p>The application model consists of one or more plain Java getter/setter classes.</p>\n<p>The view consists of one <code>JFrame</code>, one or more <code>JPanels</code>, and Swing components.</p>\n<p>Each <code>Action</code> or <code>ActionListener</code> class makes up the controller.  There's usually not one controller to &quot;rule them all&quot;.</p>\n<h2>Model</h2>\n<p>The first model class I created is the <code>Item</code> class.  The <code>Item</code> class holds a name and a price.  The price is specified in pence.  Using an int field to hold the price makes the calculations easier.  I translate the pence into pounds when displaying the prices.</p>\n<p>The second model class I created is the <code>VendingMachineModel</code> class. The <code>VendingMachineModel</code> class holds a <code>java.util.List</code> of items, a <code>java.util.List</code> of coins, an <code>int</code> balance field, and an <code>int</code> change field.</p>\n<h2>View</h2>\n<p>Your view was easy to follow and well structured, so I don't have a lot of comments here.  I used a <code>ButtonGroup</code> to limit the <code>JRadioButtons</code> to one selection.</p>\n<p>Don't make all the Swing components class fields.  It's confusing for readers of your code.  Class fields should only be used for fields needed in more than one method.</p>\n<p>Order your methods within a class from the most important method to the least important methods.  This makes the code easier for people to read and understand.</p>\n<h2>Controller</h2>\n<p>I used lambda expressions for all the <code>JButtons</code> except the purchase button.  That <code>ActionPerformed</code> method was too large for a lambda expression, in my opinion, so I created a <code>PurchaseListener</code> class.</p>\n<h1>Code</h1>\n<p>Here's the complete runnable code.

of the below code into their own classes but I'm having trouble figuring out how to call certain methods linked to the swing components of my GUI class in the Controller class.</p>\n<p>My problem is that when I create an instance of the GUI class in the Controller class, the JRadioButtons class variables in GUI are only initialized in the createRBButtonsPanel() method in GUI. This then gives me a NullPointerException when I attempt to call the cokeRb.getText() method for example in the actionPerformed method of the Controller as I have not called the chain of events that

The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called &quot;runs&quot;. The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners&#39; advance around the bases.[2] A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely. A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called &quot;out&quot; can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates&#39; turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners &quot;out&quot;, which forces them out of the field of play. Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team&#39;s players out. The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team&#39;s turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        &lt;item&gt;Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are &quot;singles&quot; (with one player per side) and &quot;doubles&quot; (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side&#39;s half of the court.Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.[1]The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by China. Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men&#39;s singles, women&#39;s singles, men&#39;s doubles, and women&#39;s doubles,[2] with mixed doubles added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.[3&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        &lt;item&gt;Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender&#39;s hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one&#39;s pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach&#39;s game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        &lt;item&gt;Bowling is a target sport and recreational activity in which a player rolls a ball toward pins (in pin bowling) or another target (in target bowling). The term bowling usually refers to pin bowling (most commonly ten-pin bowling), though in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries, bowling could also refer to target bowling, such as lawn bowls.In pin bowling, the goal is to knock over pins on a long playing surface known as a lane. Lanes have a wood or synthetic surface onto which protective lubricating oil is applied in different specified oil patterns that affect ball motion. A strike is achieved when all the pins are knocked down on the first roll, and a spare is achieved if all the pins are knocked over on a second roll. Common types of pin bowling include ten-pin, candlepin, duckpin, nine-pin, five-pin and kegel. The historical game skittles is the forerunner of modern pin bowling.In target bowling, the aim is usually to get the ball as close to a mark as possible. The surface in target bowling may be grass, gravel, or synthetic.[1] Lawn bowls, bocce, carpet bowls, p&#233;tanque, and boules may have both indoor and outdoor varieties. Curling is also related to bowls.Bowling is played by 120 million people in more than 90 countries (including 70 million in the United States alone),[2] and is the subject of video games.&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        &lt;item&gt;Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport.[1] People engaged in cycling are referred to as &quot;cyclists&quot;,[2] &quot;bicyclists&quot;,[3] or &quot;bikers&quot;.[4] Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, &quot;cycling&quot; also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadricycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide.[5] They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world, especially in densely populated European cities.[6]Cycling is widely regarded as an effective and efficient mode of transportation[7][8] optimal for short to moderate distances.Bicycles provide numerous possible benefits in comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling, easier parking, increased maneuverability, and access to roads, bike paths and rural trails. Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution, reduced greenhouse gas emissions,[9] and greatly reduced traffic congestion.[10] These have a lower financial cost for users as well as for society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required). By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses, transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.[11]In addition, cycling provides a variety of health benefits.[12] The World Health Organization (WHO) states that cycling can reduce the risk of cancers, heart disease, and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary lifestyles.[13][10] Cycling on stationary bikes have also been used as part of rehabilitation for lower limb injuries, particularly after hip surgery.[14] Individuals who cycle regularly have also reported mental health improvements, including less perceived stress and better vitality.[15]&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        &lt;item&gt;Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes, though recreational courses can be smaller, often having nine holes. Each hole on the course must contain a teeing ground to start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup 4+1⁄4 inches (11 cm) in diameter. There are other standard forms of terrain in between, such as the fairway, rough (long grass), bunkers (or &quot;sand traps&quot;), and various hazards (water, rocks) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement.Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known as stroke play, or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team, known as match play. Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels, but most especially at the elite level.The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland. The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764. Golf&#39;s first major, and the world&#39;s oldest tournament in existence, is The Open Championship, also known as the British Open, which was first played in 1860 at the Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire, Scotland. This is one of the four major championships in men&#39;s professional golf, the other three being played in the United States: The Masters, the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        &lt;item&gt;Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions).[1] This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion.[2] A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity.[3] The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy.[4]It is assumed that the ancestors of humankind developed the ability to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago, probably in order to hunt animals.[5] Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas. Records of competitive racing date back to the Tailteann Games in Ireland between 632 BCE and 1171 BCE,[6][7][8] while the first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE. Running has been described as the world&#39;s most accessible sport.[9]&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        &lt;item&gt;&quot;Soccer team&quot; and &quot;Soccer&quot; redirect here.

The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score more goals than the opposition by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal, usually within a time frame of 90 or more minutes.Football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The ball is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference and known as the football. The two teams compete to get the ball into the other team&#39;s goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. Players are not allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play, except for the goalkeepers within the penalty area. Players may use any other part of their body to strike or pass the ball and mainly use their feet. The team that scores more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout, depending on the format of the competition. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss before kick-off or penalty kicks.[4]&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        &lt;item&gt;Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, or other liquid, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival. Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs and the body to achieve hydrodynamic thrust which results in directional motion. Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival response.[1]Swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities,[2][3][4][5] and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum.[6] As a formalized sport, swimming features in a range of local, national, and international competitions, including every modern Summer Olympics.Swimming relies on the nearly neutral buoyancy of the human body. On average, the body has a relative density of 0.98 compared to water, which causes the body to float. However, buoyancy varies on the basis of body composition, lung inflation, muscle and fat content, centre of gravity and the salinity of the water. Higher levels of body fat and saltier water both lower the relative density of the body and increase its buoyancy. Human males tend to have a lower centre of gravity and higher muscle content, therefore find it more difficult to float or be buoyant. See also: Hydrostatic weighing.Since the human body is less dense than water, water is able to support the weight of the body during swimming. As a result, swimming is “low-impact” compared to land activities such as running. The density and viscosity of water also create resistance for objects moving through the water. Swimming strokes use this resistance to create propulsion, but this same resistance also generates drag on the body.&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        &lt;item&gt;Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball, also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table using small solid rackets. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce once on their side of the table and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent&#39;s options, giving the hitter a great advantage.Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in 1926. ITTF currently includes 226 member associations.[3] The table tennis official rules are specified in the ITTF handbook.[4] Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988,[5] with several event categories. From 1988 until 2004, these were men&#39;s singles, women&#39;s singles, men&#39;s doubles and women&#39;s doubles. Since 2008, a team event has been played instead of the doubles.The sport originated in Victorian England, where it was played among the upper-class as an after-dinner parlour game.[1][2] It has been suggested that makeshift versions of the game were developed by British military officers in India around the 1860s or 1870s, who brought it back with them.[6] A row of books stood up along the center of the table as a net, two more books served as rackets and were used to continuously hit a golf-ball.[7][8]The name &quot;ping-pong&quot; was in wide use before British manufacturer J and Son Ltd trademarked it in 1901. The name &quot;ping-pong&quot; then came to describe the game played using the rather expensive  equipment, with other manufacturers calling it table tennis. A similar situation arose in the United States, where  sold the rights to the &quot;ping-pong&quot; name to Parker Brothers. Parker Brothers then enforced its trademark for the term in the 1920s, making the various associations change their names to &quot;table tennis&quot; instead of the more common, but trademarked, term.[9]&lt;/item&gt;\r\n        &lt;item&gt;Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent&#39;s court. The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.[1][2]Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. The modern game of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis.[3] It had close connections both to various field (lawn) games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis.[4]The rules of modern tennis have changed little since the 1890s. Two exceptions are that until 1961 the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times,[5][6] and the adoption of the tiebreak in the 1970s.[7] A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point-challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point, a system known as Hawk-Eye.[8][9]Tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport.[10] The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the Majors) are especially popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the US Open also played on hard courts.[11]&lt;/item&gt;\r\n    &lt;/string-array&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nEverythink is working fine before adding this string array in strings.xml.

The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called &quot;runs&quot;. The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases.[2] A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely. A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called &quot;out&quot; can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners &quot;out&quot;, which forces them out of the field of play. Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team's players out. The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States. Baseball is popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are &quot;singles&quot; (with one player per side) and &quot;doubles&quot; (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.[1]The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by China. Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles,[2] with mixed doubles added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racquet movements.[3&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;Bowling is a target sport and recreational activity in which a player rolls a ball toward pins (in pin bowling) or another target (in target bowling). The term bowling usually refers to pin bowling (most commonly ten-pin bowling), though in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries, bowling could also refer to target bowling, such as lawn bowls.In pin bowling, the goal is to knock over pins on a long playing surface known as a lane. Lanes have a wood or synthetic surface onto which protective lubricating oil is applied in different specified oil patterns that affect ball motion. A strike is achieved when all the pins are knocked down on the first roll, and a spare is achieved if all the pins are knocked over on a second roll. Common types of pin bowling include ten-pin, candlepin, duckpin, nine-pin, five-pin and kegel. The historical game skittles is the forerunner of modern pin bowling.In target bowling, the aim is usually to get the ball as close to a mark as possible. The surface in target bowling may be grass, gravel, or synthetic.[1] Lawn bowls, bocce, carpet bowls, pétanque, and boules may have both indoor and outdoor varieties. Curling is also related to bowls.Bowling is played by 120 million people in more than 90 countries (including 70 million in the United States alone),[2] and is the subject of video games.&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport.[1] People engaged in cycling are referred to as &quot;cyclists&quot;,[2] &quot;bicyclists&quot;,[3] or &quot;bikers&quot;.[4] Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, &quot;cycling&quot; also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadricycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide.[5] They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world, especially in densely populated European cities.[6]Cycling is widely regarded as an effective and efficient mode of transportation[7][8] optimal for short to moderate distances.Bicycles provide numerous possible benefits in comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling, easier parking, increased maneuverability, and access to roads, bike paths and rural trails. Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution, reduced greenhouse gas emissions,[9] and greatly reduced traffic congestion.[10] These have a lower financial cost for users as well as for society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required). By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses, transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.[11]In addition, cycling provides a variety of health benefits.[12] The World Health Organization (WHO) states that cycling can reduce the risk of cancers, heart disease, and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary lifestyles.[13][10] Cycling on stationary bikes have also been used as part of rehabilitation for lower limb injuries, particularly after hip surgery.[14] Individuals who cycle regularly have also reported mental health improvements, including less perceived stress and better vitality.[15]&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. The game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes, though recreational courses can be smaller, often having nine holes. Each hole on the course must contain a teeing ground to start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup 4+1⁄4 inches (11 cm) in diameter. There are other standard forms of terrain in between, such as the fairway, rough (long grass), bunkers (or &quot;sand traps&quot;), and various hazards (water, rocks) but each hole on a course is unique in its specific layout and arrangement.Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known as stroke play, or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an individual or team, known as match play. Stroke play is the most commonly seen format at all levels, but most especially at the elite level.The modern game of golf originated in 15th century Scotland. The 18-hole round was created at the Old Course at St Andrews in 1764. Golf's first major, and the world's oldest tournament in existence, is The Open Championship, also known as the British Open, which was first played in 1860 at the Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire, Scotland. This is one of the four major championships in men's professional golf, the other three being played in the United States: The Masters, the U.S. Open, and the PGA Championship&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions).[1] This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion.[2] A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity.[3] The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy.[4]It is assumed that the ancestors of humankind developed the ability to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago, probably in order to hunt animals.[5] Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas. Records of competitive racing date back to the Tailteann Games in Ireland between 632 BCE and 1171 BCE,[6][7][8] while the first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE. Running has been described as the world's most accessible sport.[9]&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;item&gt;&quot;Soccer team&quot; and &quot;Soccer&quot; redirect here.

For a date-only, use [`LocalDate`][2]. \r\n\r\n    LocalDate ld = LocalDate.parse( &quot;2013-03-10&quot; ) ;\r\n    LocalTime lt = LocalTime.parse( &quot;12:30:45&quot; ) ;\r\n\r\nNeither of those have a time zone, nor offset-from-UTC. So they have no meaning until assigned a zone or offset.\r\n\r\nSpecify a [proper time zone name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_zones_by_name) in the format of `continent/region`, such as [`America/Montreal`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America/Montreal), [`Africa/Casablanca`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa/Casablanca), or `Pacific/Auckland`. Never use the 3-4 letter abbreviation such as `EST` or `IST` as they are *not* true time zones, not standardized, and not even unique(!). \r\n\r\n    ZoneId z = ZoneId.of( &quot;Pacific/Auckland&quot; ) ;\r\n\r\nAssign the zone to the date and time to get a [`ZonedDateTime`][3]. \r\n\r\n    ZonedDateTime zdt = ZonedDateTime.of( ld , lt , z ) ;\r\n\r\nNow we have an actual moment, a point on the timeline. The `ZonedDateTime` class adjusts your time-of-day if your passed `LocalTime` is not valid on that particular date in that zone. Such an adjustment is needed in case of an anomaly such as [Daylight Saving Time (DST)][4]. Be sure to read the doc to understand the algorithm of that adjustment, to see if you agree its approach.\r\n\r\nTo see that same moment in UTC, extract an `Instant`.

These classes supplant the troublesome old [legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system) date-time classes such as [`java.util.Date`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Date.html), [`Calendar`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html), &amp; [`SimpleDateFormat`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html).\r\n\r\nThe [*Joda-Time*](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) project, now in [maintenance mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_mode), advises migration to the [java.time](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html) classes.\r\n\r\nTo learn more, see the [*Oracle Tutorial*](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/TOC.html). And search Stack Overflow for many examples and explanations. Specification is [JSR 310](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310).\r\n\r\nWhere to obtain the java.time classes? \r\n\r\n - [**Java SE 8**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_8), [**Java SE 9**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_9), and later\r\n  - Built-in. \r\n  - Part of the standard Java API with a bundled implementation.\r\n  - Java 9 adds some minor features and fixes.\r\n - [**Java SE 6**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_6) and [**Java SE 7**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_7)\r\n  - Much of the java.time functionality is back-ported to Java 6 &amp; 7 in [***ThreeTen-Backport***](http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/).\r\n - [**Android**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system))\r\n  - Later versions of Android bundle implementations of the java.time classes.\r\n  - For earlier Android, the [***ThreeTenABP***](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP) project adapts *ThreeTen-Backport* (mentioned above). See [*How to use ThreeTenABP…*](http://stackoverflow.com/q/38922754/642706).\r\n\r\nThe [**ThreeTen-Extra**](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/) project extends java.time with additional classes. This project is a proving ground for possible future additions to java.time. You may find some useful classes here such as [`Interval`](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/Interval.html), [`YearWeek`](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/YearWeek.html), [`YearQuarter`](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/YearQuarter.html), and [more](http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/index.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/time/LocalTime.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/time/LocalDate.html\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/time/ZonedDateTime.html\r\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time","title":"Converting GregorianCalendar to Date on day of DST loses an hour?","body":"<h1>tl;dr</h1>\n\n<pre><code>ZonedDateTime.of(\n    LocalDate.parse( \"2013-03-10\" ) ,\n    LocalTime.parse( \"12:30:45\" ) ,\n    ZoneId.of( \"Africa/Tunis\" )\n)                                    // Instantiate a `ZonedDateTime` object.\n.toString()                          // Moment seen through wall-clock time of people in Tunisia time zone.\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2013-03-10T12:30:45+01:00[Africa/Tunis]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>ZonedDateTime.of(\n    LocalDate.parse( \"2013-03-10\" ) ,\n    LocalTime.parse( \"12:30:45\" ) ,\n    ZoneId.of( \"Africa/Tunis\" )\n)\n.toInstant()                         // Convert to `Instant` from `ZonedDateTime`, for UTC value.\n.toString()                          // Same moment, adjusted into wall-clock time of UTC.

Java streams are the right tool for the job when the operations you need to do are either [A] an operation solely on a single element of a stream, or [B] an operation on all of them.\r\n\r\nYou want an operation on some of them (specifically, the &#39;predecessors&#39;). Stream, fundamentally, wasn&#39;t designed for that. You&#39;re using the wrong tool for the job.

In that task you can check for a condition on which you are waiting. \r\n\r\nSo no need for you to reinvent the wheel. Use the *Executors* framework built into Java; it’s excellent. \r\n\r\nSearch for that class name. Much has been already written on the subject, some of it authored by me. Search to learn more.\r\n\r\nRegarding [`Timer`][5], that class was supplanted years ago by the Executors framework. This fact is noted in the Javadoc.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Task reschedules itself\r\n\r\nYou clarified that your goal is to check a condition every minute for a maximum of ten times. \r\n\r\nOne way to do this is to have the task reschedule itself.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class ConditionCheckingTask implements Runnable \r\n{\r\n    private final ScheduledExecutorService ses ;\r\n    private final Instant whenInstantiated = Instant.now() ;\r\n\r\n    // Constructor\r\n    public ConditionCheckingTask( final ScheduledExecutorService ses ) {\r\n        this.ses = ses ;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void run() {\r\n        if( someConditionIsTrue ) {\r\n            doSomething ;\r\n        } else if ( ChronoUnit.MINUTES.between( this.whenInstantiated , Instant.now() ) &gt; 10 ) {\r\n            // We have exceeded our time limit, so let this task die.\r\n            return ;\r\n        } else {  // Else wait a minute to check condition again.\r\n            this.ses.schedule( this , 1 , TimeUnit.MINUTES ) ;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure that accessing `someConditionIsTrue` is thread-safe. For example, if some other thread is flipping a boolean flag to signal our task, make that flag an `AtomicBoolean`. To learn more, search Stack Overflow, and read the book listed below.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in your app, instantiate and remember a `ScheduledExecutorService` object.\r\n\r\n    ScheduledExecutorService scheduledExecutorService = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor() ;\r\n\r\nBe sure to eventually shut down the executor service before your app exits. Search to learn more. This has been addressed many times on Stack Overflow.\r\n\r\nInstantiate your task. Pass the scheduled executor service to the task’s constructor, so that it might reschedule itself every minute.\r\n\r\n    ConditionCheckingTask task = new ConditionCheckingTask( scheduledExecutorService ) ;\r\n\r\nTo start things off, schedule a run of that task with little or no delay. \r\n\r\n    scheduledExecutorService.schedule( task , 0 , TimeUnit.MINUTES ) ;\r\n\r\nAs part of the first run, the task will reschedule itself.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nNote: Before deploying any multi-threaded code, be sure to study well the excellent book by Goetz et al., [*Java Concurrency In Practice*][6].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71281530/why-not-implement-a-time-controlled-task-in-the-current-thread/71281676#comment125997921_71281530\r\n  [2]: https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/loom/Main\r\n  [3]: https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/8277131\r\n  [4]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService.html\r\n  [5]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Timer.html\r\n  [6]: https://jcip.net/","title":"Why not implement a time controlled task in the current thread?","body":"<h1>Sleeping main thread freezes your app</h1>\n<p>The entire point to multi-threading is to offload work from the initial thread running your app.</p>\n<p>A thread sleeping until a certain time is not doing any other work.

For both `x -&gt; _void()` and `x -&gt; _one()`, both overloads are potentially applicable. This is because both lambda expressions are [*congruent*][2] to the function types of both `Function&lt;T, R&gt;` and `Consumer&lt;T&gt;`. The important condition is:\r\n\r\n&gt; If the lambda parameters are assumed to have the same types as the\r\n&gt; function type&#39;s parameter types, then:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; - If the function type&#39;s result is void, the lambda body is either a statement expression (&#167;14.8) or a void-compatible block.\r\n&gt; -  If the function type&#39;s result is a (non-void) type R, then either i) the lambda body is an expression that is compatible with R in an\r\n&gt; assignment context, or ii) the lambda body is a value-compatible block, and each result expression (&#167;15.27.2) is compatible with R in an assignment context.\r\n\r\n(Also notice that for the cases that compile, exactly one of the methods is potentially applicable.)\r\n\r\nThen we try to resolve the method to invoke using [strict invocation][3]. Loose and variable arity invocation are not very relevant here, so if this phase fails, the whole thing fails. Notice that at the start of that section, the spec defines &quot;pertinent to applicability&quot;, and both `x -&gt; _void()` and `x -&gt; _one()` are not pertinent to applicability. This will be important.\r\n\r\nWe then reach:\r\n\r\n&gt; If m is a generic method and the method invocation does not provide explicit type arguments, then the applicability of the method is inferred as specified in [&#167;18.5.1][4].\r\n\r\nAccording to &#167;18.5.1, to determine the applicability of a method wrt to a call, you first add inference bounds according to the arguments and type parameters. Then you [reduce][5] and [incorporate][6] the bounds. If there are no *false* bounds (which are produced when you have conflicting bounds) in the result, then the method is applicable. The relevant point here is that arguments that are not pertinent to applicability are not considered when adding those bounds:\r\n\r\n&gt; To test for applicability by strict invocation:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; If k ≠ n, or if there exists an i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) such that ei is\r\n&gt; pertinent to applicability (&#167;15.12.2.2) and either i) ei is a\r\n&gt; standalone expression of a primitive type but Fi is a reference type,\r\n&gt; or ii) Fi is a primitive type but ei is not a standalone expression of\r\n&gt; a primitive type; then the method is not applicable and there is no\r\n&gt; need to proceed with inference.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Otherwise, C includes, for all i (1 ≤ i ≤ k) where ei is pertinent to\r\n&gt; applicability, ‹ei → Fi θ›.\r\n\r\nSo the only bounds that are added are those from the type parameters. They obviously are not going to disagree/conflict with each other and produce a *false* bound, since they are independent.\r\n\r\nSo again, both methods are *applicable*. \r\n\r\nWhen there are more than one applicable method, we of course choose the most specific method. The process for doing this for generic methods is described [here][7]. It&#39;s quite long so I won&#39;t quote it here. In principle, it is similar to how &#167;18.5.1 works - add some type bounds, if they agree with each other (no *false*), then one method is more specific than the other.

Every one of these objects is represented in its own database table. Beside being connected to a specific object, all comments share a common context in which the corresponding objects exist. What I tried for now is to use JPA-inheritance with `InheritanceType.SingleTable` so I can store the foreign keys to every &#39;commentable&#39;-object in one table and the discriminator-feature to seperate that table into different Comment-Subclasses in JPA:\r\n\r\n**Superclass Comment.java**\r\n\r\n    @Entity\r\n    @Table(name = &quot;COMMENT_TABLE&quot;)\r\n    @Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)\r\n    @DiscriminatorColumn(name = &quot;COMMENT_OBJECT_TYPE&quot;)\r\n    public class Comment {\r\n        protected String text;\r\n\r\n        protected CommonContext context;\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Subclass Object A**\r\n\r\n    @Entity\r\n    @DiscriminatorValue(value = &quot;OBJECT A&quot;)\r\n    public class ObjectAComment extends Comment {\r\n\r\n        private ObjectA objectA;\r\n    \r\n        // OneToMany-Relation exists in Object A accordingly\r\n        @JoinColumn(name = &quot;FK_OBJECT_A&quot;)\r\n        @ManyToOne\r\n        public ObjectA getObjectA() { return objectA; }\r\n    \r\n        public void setObjectA(ObjectA objectA) { this.objectA = objectA; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe other comment-classes for the other objects are designed just as for object A. The common context shall be used to get all comments for a specific situation and I would like to have a comment know its owner, so that I can easily link to that object in my application. Without the latter I had to go through all objects of that type to search for any that has comments, as not every object has them.\r\n\r\nOn designing the REST-endpoints and the EJBs I ended up creating specific methods for every subclass of `Comment.java`. For example for creating a comment I have\r\n\r\n    @POST\r\n    @Path(&quot;comments/objectA&quot;)\r\n    public Response createCommentForObjectA(ObjectAComment comment) { ... }\r\n    \r\n    @POST\r\n    @Path(&quot;comments/objectB&quot;)\r\n    public Response createCommentForObjectB(ObjectBComment comment) { ... }\r\n    \r\n    ...\r\n\r\nThis feels a bit cumbersome as I would rather have\r\n\r\n    @POST\r\n    @Path(&quot;comments&quot;)\r\n    public Response createComment(Comment comment) { ... }\r\n\r\nwhich is impossible with the current design as I would lose the specific information for the different objects. Now I see three possible ways to go on:\r\n\r\n# Version 1 #\r\nI stick with the current solution and create CRUD-methods for every type of comment.\r\n\r\n# Version 2 #\r\nA friend suggested, that I could use transient properties in `Comment.java`:\r\n\r\n    public class Comment {\r\n        ...\r\n        private COMMENT_OBJECT_TYPE objectType;\r\n        private long idObject;\r\n    \r\n        @Transient\r\n        public long getIdObject() { return idObject; }\r\n        ...\r\n    \r\n        @Transient\r\n        public COMMENT_OBJECT_TYPE getObjectType() { return objectType; }\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWith this I could generalize the parameter of the REST-endpoint and return specific objects depending on the object type:\r\n\r\n    @POST\r\n    @Path(&quot;comments&quot;)\r\n    public Response createComment(Comment comment) {\r\n        // return ObjectAComment, ObjectBComment, ... depending on the object type\r\n    }\r\n\r\n# Version 3 #\r\nDitch the whole `@Inheritance` and `@DiscriminatorColumn`, put everything in one JPA-class and do the whole organizing of the comment context myself.

Every one of these objects is represented in its own database table. Beside being connected to a specific object, all comments share a common context in which the corresponding objects exist. What I tried for now is to use JPA-inheritance with <code>InheritanceType.SingleTable</code> so I can store the foreign keys to every 'commentable'-object in one table and the discriminator-feature to seperate that table into different Comment-Subclasses in JPA:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Superclass Comment.java</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>@Entity\n@Table(name = \"COMMENT_TABLE\")\n@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)\n@DiscriminatorColumn(name = \"COMMENT_OBJECT_TYPE\")\npublic class Comment {\n    protected String text;\n\n    protected CommonContext context;\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Subclass Object A</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>@Entity\n@DiscriminatorValue(value = \"OBJECT A\")\npublic class ObjectAComment extends Comment {\n\n    private ObjectA objectA;\n\n    // OneToMany-Relation exists in Object A accordingly\n    @JoinColumn(name = \"FK_OBJECT_A\")\n    @ManyToOne\n    public ObjectA getObjectA() { return objectA; }\n\n    public void setObjectA(ObjectA objectA) { this.objectA = objectA; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The other comment-classes for the other objects are designed just as for object A. The common context shall be used to get all comments for a specific situation and I would like to have a comment know its owner, so that I can easily link to that object in my application. Without the latter I had to go through all objects of that type to search for any that has comments, as not every object has them.</p>\n\n<p>On designing the REST-endpoints and the EJBs I ended up creating specific methods for every subclass of <code>Comment.java</code>. For example for creating a comment I have</p>\n\n<pre><code>@POST\n@Path(\"comments/objectA\")\npublic Response createCommentForObjectA(ObjectAComment comment) { ... }\n\n@POST\n@Path(\"comments/objectB\")\npublic Response createCommentForObjectB(ObjectBComment comment) { ... }\n\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This feels a bit cumbersome as I would rather have</p>\n\n<pre><code>@POST\n@Path(\"comments\")\npublic Response createComment(Comment comment) { ... }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which is impossible with the current design as I would lose the specific information for the different objects. Now I see three possible ways to go on:</p>\n\n<h1>Version 1</h1>\n\n<p>I stick with the current solution and create CRUD-methods for every type of comment.</p>\n\n<h1>Version 2</h1>\n\n<p>A friend suggested, that I could use transient properties in <code>Comment.java</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Comment {\n    ...\n    private COMMENT_OBJECT_TYPE objectType;\n    private long idObject;\n\n    @Transient\n    public long getIdObject() { return idObject; }\n    ...\n\n    @Transient\n    public COMMENT_OBJECT_TYPE getObjectType() { return objectType; }\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With this I could generalize the parameter of the REST-endpoint and return specific objects depending on the object type:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@POST\n@Path(\"comments\")\npublic Response createComment(Comment comment) {\n    // return ObjectAComment, ObjectBComment, ... depending on the object type\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Version 3</h1>\n\n<p>Ditch the whole <code>@Inheritance</code> and <code>@DiscriminatorColumn</code>, put everything in one JPA-class and do the whole organizing of the comment context myself. Additionaly I would lose type safety.</p>\n\n<p>None of these solutions feels completely right to me, hence I would like to ask if there is a preferable way to design this kind of comment feature and is there maybe something I am missing completely?</p>\n\n<h1>Edit 1</h1>\n\n<p>Added information that all comments and objects share a common context. Renamed previous <code>COMMENT_CONTEXT</code> to <code>COMMENT_OBJECT_TYPE</code> to avoid a misunderstanding between this common context and the object type a comment is related to.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","ucanaccess","jackcess"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":179293,"reputation":15713,"user_id":411846,"accept_rate":80,"display_name":"centic"},"score":0,"creation_date":1630347895,"post_id":68974078,"comment_id":121926784,"body_markdown":"Not an expert myself, but looks like Android does not provide java.sql.XXX classes.

Because under hood iteration over a *collection* with *enhanced for loop* makes use of an **iterator** that is provided by the *collection*. And while iteration happens *collection* must **not** be modified other than by means of the iterator itself, i.e. by using method `remove()` of the *iterator*.\r\n\r\nTo iterate over the collection with an *iterator* firstly you have to an instance of the `Iterator` by invoking `.iterator()` on the collection. Methods of the `Iterator` class `hasNext()` and `next()` are used to check whether the next element exists and to move to the next element respectively.\r\n\r\n    public static List&lt;Integer&gt; removeNumberIfStarsWith(List&lt;Integer&gt; source, int target) {\r\n        List&lt;Integer&gt; copy = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(source); // defencive copy to preserve the source list intact\r\n\r\n        Iterator&lt;Integer&gt; iterator = copy.iterator();\r\n        while (iterator.hasNext()) {\r\n            Integer item = iterator.next();\r\n            if (item.toString().startsWith(String.valueOf(target))) {\r\n                iterator.remove();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return copy;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nTo implement this task with **traditional for loop** we have to keep in mind that removal of elements must not mess the indices that are haven&#39;t visited yet. Probably the simplest way to do it is to iterate in reversed order starting from the last index.\r\n\r\n**Note:** \r\n* there are **two** flavors of `remove()` method available with an instance of the `List` interface. One accepts an `int` *index* another an `object` that has to be removed. And this case is interesting because it is a choice between `remove(int)` and `remove(Integer)`. Remember that when an overloaded method is called if a version of this method with exactly the *same set of parameter types* (same types in the same order) exists, the compiler will map this version to that method call. I.e. method `remove(int)` will be invoked since we are passing a primitive type `int`.\r\n\r\nThe code for this task with traditional for loop might look like:\r\n\r\n    public static List&lt;Integer&gt; removeNumberIfStarsWith(List&lt;Integer&gt; source, int target) {\r\n        List&lt;Integer&gt; copy = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(source); // defencive copy to preserve the source list intact\r\n\r\n        for (int i = copy.size() - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\r\n            Integer item = copy.get(i);\r\n            if (item.toString().startsWith(String.valueOf(target))) {\r\n                copy.remove(i);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return copy;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSince this question is related to basic operations with collections I don&#39;t assume the knowledge of *lambda expressions* and *streams*. But for completeness and for *future readers*, I&#39;ll provide two other options that I&#39;ve mentioned above.\r\n\r\n[*for information on lambda expressions and functional interfaces read this*](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html)\r\n\r\n[to get familiar with Stream IPA take a look at this tutorial](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams.html)\r\n\r\nThe condition inside the method `filter()` in the stream pipeline and  [`Collection.removeIf()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collection.html#removeIf(java.util.function.Predicate)) must defenetelly look familiar to you. Both method expect [`Predicate`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/function/Predicate.html) a function that takes an object and returns a boolean value. `Collection.removeIf()` will remove the element if the predicate returns `true`, but `filter()` does the opposite it&#39;ll retain the element if the predicate returns `true`.\r\n\r\nSo stream-based implementation might look like this:\r\n\r\n    public static List&lt;Integer&gt; removeNumberIfStarsWith(List&lt;Integer&gt; source, int target) {\r\n        return source.stream()\r\n                .filter(item -&gt; !item.toString().startsWith(String.valueOf(target)))\r\n                .collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSolution with `Collection.removeIf()`:\r\n\r\n    public static List&lt;Integer&gt; removeNumberIfStarsWith(List&lt;Integer&gt; source, int target) {\r\n        List&lt;Integer&gt; copy = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(source); // defencive copy to preserve the source list intact\r\n\r\n        copy.removeIf(item -&gt; item.toString().startsWith(String.valueOf(target)));\r\n        return copy;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n`main()`\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        List&lt;Integer&gt; list = List.of(64, 5, 10, 66, 7, 68);\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(list);\r\n        System.out.println(removeNumberIfStarsWith(list, 6)); // value 6 provided as an argument and not hardcoded inside the methods\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Output** (for all the versions)\r\n```\r\n[64, 5, 10, 66, 7, 68]\r\n[5, 10, 7]\r\n```","title":"Remove numbers from a list that begins with a specif digit","body":"<p>There are several ways how you can approach this task:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>using an <code>Iterator</code>;</li>\n<li>by utilizing so-called <strong>traditional for loop</strong>;</li>\n<li>with a help of <strong>Stream IPA</strong>;</li>\n<li>using method <code>Collection.removeIf()</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note</strong> that attempt to address this problem using <strong>enhanced for loop</strong> (sometimes called &quot;for-each&quot; loop) will lead to <code>CuncurrentModdificationException</code> at runtime (if the collection will get modified).

Probably the simplest way to do it is to iterate in reversed order starting from the last index.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>there are <strong>two</strong> flavors of <code>remove()</code> method available with an instance of the <code>List</code> interface. One accepts an <code>int</code> <em>index</em> another an <code>object</code> that has to be removed. And this case is interesting because it is a choice between <code>remove(int)</code> and <code>remove(Integer)</code>. Remember that when an overloaded method is called if a version of this method with exactly the <em>same set of parameter types</em> (same types in the same order) exists, the compiler will map this version to that method call. I.e. method <code>remove(int)</code> will be invoked since we are passing a primitive type <code>int</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The code for this task with traditional for loop might look like:</p>\n<pre><code>public static List&lt;Integer&gt; removeNumberIfStarsWith(List&lt;Integer&gt; source, int target) {\n    List&lt;Integer&gt; copy = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(source); // defencive copy to preserve the source list intact\n\n    for (int i = copy.size() - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\n        Integer item = copy.get(i);\n        if (item.toString().startsWith(String.valueOf(target))) {\n            copy.remove(i);\n        }\n    }\n    return copy;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Since this question is related to basic operations with collections I don't assume the knowledge of <em>lambda expressions</em> and <em>streams</em>. But for completeness and for <em>future readers</em>, I'll provide two other options that I've mentioned above.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>for information on lambda expressions and functional interfaces read this</em></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">to get familiar with Stream IPA take a look at this tutorial</a></p>\n<p>The condition inside the method <code>filter()</code> in the stream pipeline and  <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collection.html#removeIf(java.util.function.Predicate)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>Collection.removeIf()</code></a> must defenetelly look familiar to you.

removeNumberIfStarsWith(List&lt;Integer&gt; source, int target) {\n    List&lt;Integer&gt; copy = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(source); // defencive copy to preserve the source list intact\n\n    copy.removeIf(item -&gt; item.toString().startsWith(String.valueOf(target)));\n    return copy;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>main()</code></p>\n<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {\n    List&lt;Integer&gt; list = List.of(64, 5, 10, 66, 7, 68);\n\n    System.out.println(list);\n    System.out.println(removeNumberIfStarsWith(list, 6)); // value 6 provided as an argument and not hardcoded inside the methods\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Output</strong> (for all the versions)</p>\n<pre><code>[64, 5, 10, 66, 7, 68]\n[5, 10, 7]\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":10378460,"reputation":23,"user_id":8833377,"display_name":"Jo&#227;o Gabriel"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":171,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":71273580,"answer_count":3,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1645988496,"creation_date":1645759776,"question_id":71260689,"body_markdown":"For example, i have this list\r\n```\r\nList&lt;Integer&gt;

I have a model with 2 Ontologies and 2 sets of Instance data. One Ontology is actually FOAF (Friend-of-a-Friend), and the other also represents people. I tried adding statements to align these two Ontologies and the statements seem to have effect - after adding them to the model and printing statements about them from the model, I can see that they are added. However, when I perform SPARQL query, it does not seem to take them into account.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of simplicity, I will just write the main points in the code.\r\n\r\nI am performing the following SPARQL query on a FOAF ontology, where `swp2:me` is an instance in my instance data:\r\n```\r\nselect distinct ?name where {\r\n    swp2:me foaf:knows ?friend .\r\n    ?friend foaf:name ?name .\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above query properly grabs all the friends of `swp2:me` resource. Next, I have another custom Ontology in this model (putting both Ontology and instance data below):\r\n```\r\n@prefix : &lt;http://www.semanticweb.org/luka/ontologies/2022/0/ont#&gt; .\r\n@prefix owl: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#&gt; .\r\n@prefix rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt; .\r\n@prefix xml: &lt;http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace&gt; .\r\n@prefix xsd: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt; .\r\n@prefix rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt; .\r\n@base &lt;http://www.semanticweb.org/luka/ontologies/2022/0/ont&gt; .\r\n\r\n&lt;http://www.semanticweb.org/luka/ontologies/2022/0/ont&gt; rdf:type owl:Ontology ;\r\n                                                         owl:versionIRI &lt;http://www.semanticweb.org/luka/ontologies/2022/0/ont/1.0.0&gt; .\r\n\r\n:hasFriend rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ,\r\n                    owl:SymmetricProperty .\r\n\r\n:hasName rdf:type owl:DatatypeProperty .\r\n\r\n:Individual rdf:type owl:Class .\r\n\r\n:Individual_5 rdf:type :Individual ;\r\n              :hasFriend :Individual_6 ,\r\n                         :Individual_7 ;\r\n              :hasName &quot;Sem Web&quot; .\r\n\r\n:Individual_6 rdf:type :Individual ;\r\n              :hasFriend :Individual_5 ;\r\n              :hasName &quot;Web O. Data&quot; .\r\n\r\n:Individual_7 rdf:type :Individual ;\r\n              :hasFriend :Individual_5 ;\r\n              :hasName &quot;Mr. Owl&quot; .\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, I try to align these two Ontologies, as well as express that `swp2:me` (instance from first Ontology) and `:Individual_5` (that is, instance from second Ontology) are the same instance.

However, when I perform SPARQL query, it does not seem to take them into account.</p>\n<p>For the sake of simplicity, I will just write the main points in the code.</p>\n<p>I am performing the following SPARQL query on a FOAF ontology, where <code>swp2:me</code> is an instance in my instance data:</p>\n<pre><code>select distinct ?name where {\n    swp2:me foaf:knows ?friend .\n    ?friend foaf:name ?name .\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above query properly grabs all the friends of <code>swp2:me</code> resource.
