That&#39;s how you find bugs."}],"owner":{"account_id":24632358,"reputation":1,"user_id":18531439,"display_name":"CiY3"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1663166245,"creation_date":1663165387,"question_id":73718522,"body_markdown":"I am trying to make a program where `object1` movement is warped by the gravity of `object2`.

Update: New Solution\r\n\r\nSkip to the `tldr;` section below for direct solution. Otherwise, enjoy:\r\n\r\nI had to accept that there were *no php-cs-fixer vscode plugins* that would work with solving the path difference between my host machine and docker container.\r\n\r\nI got deep into the weeds and I forked [Simple PHP CS FIXER](https://github.com/amurrell/simple-php-cs-fixer) adding a few more configuration options: \r\n\r\n - **executablePath** - relative to my host machine so I could use a script in my project. eg. `/Users/me/myproject/docker-phpcs` - this project was originally hardcoding `php-cs-fixer` here. That is still the default in my version.\r\n\r\n   Here&#39;s an example script:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n\r\n    docker exec -t &quot;mycontainer&quot; /var/www/site/app/vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer $@\r\n    ```\r\n    *Note: I made sure to `chmod +x` on my script to make it executable*\r\n\r\n - **hostPath** - so I could tell it my project path eg. &quot;/Users/me/code/myproject/&quot;\r\n\r\n - **dockerPath** - so I could tell it my docker container path eg. &quot;/var/www/site&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nThen I modified the extension.js to **replace** the **hostName** with the **dockerPath** in the following files:\r\n - the **config file**, if one is set.\r\n - the **document-being-saved&#39;s** fileName.\r\n\r\nSo when using this, I create my settings per-folder like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&quot;simple-php-cs-fixer.executablePath&quot;: &quot;/Users/me/code/myproject/docker-phpcs&quot;,\r\n&quot;simple-php-cs-fixer.config&quot;: &quot;.php_cs&quot;,\r\n&quot;simple-php-cs-fixer.hostPath&quot;: &quot;/Users/me/code/myproject&quot;,\r\n&quot;simple-php-cs-fixer.dockerPath&quot;: &quot;/var/www/site&quot;,\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I purposefully do not force this on save - and instead made a key-binding for the plugin&#39;s command (ctrl+s, instead of cmd + s), so I can control when I want to completely obliterate my file.\r\n\r\n# tldr;\r\n\r\nI forked the plugin to provide options for docker-relative paths and custom executable path to php-cs-fixer - I also did make a PR to the plugin - but if that does not get accepted... you can side load the extension like so:\r\n\r\n 1. &quot;install&quot; the plugin using marketplace as normal\r\n 2. go to your extensions folder (on my mac it was $HOME/.vscode/extensions\r\n 3. `git clone git@github.com:amurrell/simple-php-cs-fixer.git`\r\n 4. remove the one installed by marketplace like: `calebporzio.simple-php-cs-fixer-x.x.x`\r\n\r\n\r\nHopefully PR gets accepted...\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, with ctrl+s key-binding and this modified plugin with extra settings, I now get a fixed file according to my configuration, using my docker-container.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Another Close Solution\r\n\r\n**Update**: This was not really accurately solving my problem - my script would trigger when saving but it wasn&#39;t actually processing the current document file being edited/saved - it was triggering the script which would scan all my files defined in my configuration file. This means the plugin wasn&#39;t getting to control the configuration file either.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI got what I wanted!

To make this work I had to add <code>cursor.toNextToken();</code> after the insertion.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3107277,"reputation":1237,"user_id":2629813,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"Akshatha S R"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1537420317,"creation_date":1537420317,"answer_id":52417995,"question_id":16815397,"body_markdown":"You can use \r\n\r\n`xwpfDoc.setParagraph(XWPFParagraph paragraph, int pos)` \r\n\r\nto insert a paragraph at specific position\r\n\r\nSee the [link][1] for details\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/poi/xwpf/usermodel/XWPFDocument.html","title":"Insert a XWPFParagraph in any position of a XWPFDocument","body":"<p>You can use </p>\n\n<p><code>xwpfDoc.setParagraph(XWPFParagraph paragraph, int pos)</code> </p>\n\n<p>to insert a paragraph at specific position</p>\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/poi/xwpf/usermodel/XWPFDocument.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a> for details</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":2062171,"reputation":386,"user_id":1838474,"accept_rate":20,"display_name":"Ole"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":12935,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"answer_count":3,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1663157503,"creation_date":1369834530,"question_id":16815397,"body_markdown":"Do you know if is there a way to insert a paragraph (XWPFParagraph) inside a paragraph fullfilled document (XWPFDocument)?.\r\n\r\nThere is a method to &quot;change&quot; an already existing paragraph inside the document to another paragraph (XWPFDocument.setParagraph()) but I don&#39;t figure out how to insert NEW paragraphs into a specific position inside the document, not at the end with XWPFDocument.createParagraph().\r\n","title":"Insert a XWPFParagraph in any position of a XWPFDocument","body":"<p>Do you know if is there a way to insert a paragraph (XWPFParagraph) inside a paragraph fullfilled document (XWPFDocument)?.</p>\n\n<p>There is a method to \"change\" an already existing paragraph inside the document to another paragraph (XWPFDocument.setParagraph()) but I don't figure out how to insert NEW paragraphs into a specific position inside the document, not at the end with XWPFDocument.createParagraph().</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","compiler-errors"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":12991330,"reputation":94,"user_id":9390458,"display_name":"&#199;iğdem Erşep&#231;iler"},"score":0,"creation_date":1663137807,"post_id":73712517,"comment_id":130165394,"body_markdown":"well, it says in the error already.

So does anyone have any solution to this?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nMore Info:\r\n```\r\nAndroid Studio 4.1\r\nBuild #AI-201.8743.12.41.6858069, built on September 23, 2020\r\nRuntime version: 1.8.0_242-release-1644-b3-6222593 x86_64\r\nVM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM by JetBrains s.r.o\r\nmacOS 10.15.6\r\nGC: ParNew, ConcurrentMarkSweep\r\nMemory: 4029M\r\nCores: 8\r\nRegistry: ide.new.welcome.screen.force=true\r\nNon-Bundled Plugins: org.jetbrains.kotlin, Dart, io.flutter\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy `jave -version`\r\n```\r\nopenjdk version &quot;14.0.1&quot; 2020-04-14\r\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 14.0.1+14)\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 14.0.1+14, mixed mode, sharing)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy `/Library/Internet\\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/bin/java -version`\r\n```\r\njava version &quot;1.8.0_271&quot;\r\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_271-b09)\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.271-b09, mixed mode)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy `studio.vmoption`:\r\n```\r\n-Xms1G\r\n-Xmx4G\r\n-XX:MaxPermSize=1G\r\n-XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=512m\r\n-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC\r\n-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=50\r\n-XX:CICompilerCount=2\r\n-Dsun.io.useCanonPrefixCache=false\r\n-Djdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes=&quot;&quot;\r\n-Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf=true\r\n-Dkotlinx.coroutines.debug=off\r\n-Djdk.module.illegalAccess.silent=true\r\n-Djna.nosys=true\r\n-Djna.boot.library.path=\r\n-Didea.vendor.name=Google\r\n-XX:+UseCompressedOops\r\n-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8\r\n\r\n-XX:ErrorFile=$USER_HOME/java_error_in_studio_%p.log\r\n-XX:HeapDumpPath=$USER_HOME/java_error_in_studio.hprof\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy `idea.properties`:\r\n```\r\nidea.max.intellisense.filesize=2500\r\nidea.cycle.buffer.size=1024\r\nsun.java2d.d3d=false\r\nidea.dynamic.classpath=false\r\nidea.no.launcher=false\r\nidea.xdebug.key=-Xdebug\r\nsun.java2d.uiScale.enabled=true\r\nswing.bufferPerWindow=true\r\nidea.fatal.error.notification=disabled\r\njavax.swing.rebaseCssSizeMap=true\r\nidea.max.content.load.filesize=20000\r\nidea.popup.weight=heavy\r\nsun.java2d.pmoffscreen=false\r\nCVS_PASSFILE=~/.cvspass\r\ncom.apple.mrj.application.live-resize=false\r\njava.endorsed.dirs=\r\nidea.smooth.progress=false\r\napple.laf.useScreenMenuBar=true\r\napple.awt.fileDialogForDirectories=true\r\napple.awt.graphics.UseQuartz=true\r\napple.awt.fullscreencapturealldisplays=false\r\nidea.jre.check=true\r\ndisable.android.first.run=true\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/bb0g7.jpg\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37474669/android-studio-stuck-on-loading-screen","title":"Android Studio 4.1 Stuck at loading screen in Mac","body":"<p>My Android Studio has been stuck at loading screen since yesterday.
