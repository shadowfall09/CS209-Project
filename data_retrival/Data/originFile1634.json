I package everything I need in the jar file I give as classpath, defining the wanted versions in pom.xml, and in this jar I can find only one org/semanticweb/owlapi/io/RDFResource.class file. \r\n\r\nReading [this][1] and [this][2] I thought about having 2 different versions of OWL API, as I had another .jar with OWL API version 3.4.9 in it, in the directory tree. I moved the file and rebuilt the maven package just to be sure, and (as expected) no change.\r\n\r\nOther than the saveOntology() call, my original program is working as intended.\r\n\r\nThe only thing out of the ordinary is that IntelliJ is giving me a `Plugin &#39;maven-assembly-plugin:&#39; not found` problem, which I haven&#39;t managed to solve in any way, and have been ignoring as it hasn&#39;t been an issue in any of the operations I have needed. (If you know how to solve it of course, give me suggestions, but my main problem is the earlier mentioned exception).\r\n\r\n**EDIT** Here is the `mvn dependency:tree` output.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO]

I package everything I need in the jar file I give as classpath, defining the wanted versions in pom.xml, and in this jar I can find only one org/semanticweb/owlapi/io/RDFResource.class file.</p>\n<p>Reading <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55629878/owl-api-nosuchmethoderror\">this</a> and <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29766193/nosuchmethoderror-using-owl-api-4-0-x\">this</a> I thought about having 2 different versions of OWL API, as I had another .jar with OWL API version 3.4.9 in it, in the directory tree. I moved the file and rebuilt the maven package just to be sure, and (as expected) no change.</p>\n<p>Other than the saveOntology() call, my original program is working as intended.</p>\n<p>The only thing out of the ordinary is that IntelliJ is giving me a <code>Plugin 'maven-assembly-plugin:' not found</code> problem, which I haven't managed to solve in any way, and have been ignoring as it hasn't been an issue in any of the operations I have needed. (If you know how to solve it of course, give me suggestions, but my main problem is the earlier mentioned exception).</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Here is the <code>mvn dependency:tree</code>

I have seen that Huawei HUAWEI Y5 causes a lot of these crashes.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":18285519,"reputation":41,"user_id":13313512,"display_name":"Arian A"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":4238,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"answer_count":2,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1643617910,"creation_date":1586886053,"question_id":61213874,"body_markdown":"We recently implemented foreground service and on Android 9 (Samsung devices only) some users experience some recurring crashes and we don&#39;t know what&#39;s causing this.

The robot takes a screen capture of the screen, which is then stored into a BufferedImage.\r\n2. The data of the image is stored in an integer array\r\n3. An int stream is used to select all pixel locations that correspond to sufficiently blue pixels\r\n4. These blue pixels are placed in an array called output at the same locations they were taken from. However, the rest of the array has value 0.\r\n5. A destination file for my modified image is created\r\n6. I create a byte buffer that is 4 times the length of the output array, and data from the output array is placed in it.\r\n7. I create a byte array from the buffer then create an input stream with it\r\n8. Finally, I read the stream to create an Image from it\r\n9. I use System.out.println() to print some data from the image to see if the image exists.\r\n\r\nStep 9 is where the problem shows up.\r\nI keep getting a NullPointerException, meaning that the image doesn&#39;t exist, it is null.\r\nI don&#39;t understand what I did wrong.\r\nI tried using ByteArrayInputStream instead of InputStream, but that doesn&#39;t work as well. Then, I thought that maybe the first couple of bytes encode the coding information for the image, so I tried copying that over to the output array, but that didn&#39;t solve the problem either.

Once a new JavaFX project has been created, most of the rest of the steps in the tutorial are either redundant or wrong. \r\n\r\nStep 1, “Create a JavaFX project&quot;, does a lot more than just “Create a Java project”, which is why everything else is different from the tutorial.\r\n\r\nA better tutorial for getting started with JavaFX with Idea, is the official Idea documentation:\r\n\r\n * [Create a new JavaFX project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/javafx.html).\r\n\r\n*Differences between creating a new Java project and creating a new JavaFX project*\r\n\r\nThe new JavaFX project:\r\n\r\n 1. Provides a build script for Maven (pom.xml) or Gradle (build.gradle).  \r\n\r\n 2. Adds the appropriate dependencies for JavaFX base, graphics, controls and fxml.\r\n\r\n 3. Provides an example application and controller code that you can run immediately.  \r\n\r\n 4. The example project is modular and provides a module-info.java\r\n\r\n 5. Because the program is modular and dependencies are downloaded via maven and recognized by the IDE, you don’t need to manually configure VM runtime options for the module path and adding modules.\r\n\r\n 6. Idea will recognize the Maven or Gradle projects and automatically synchronize the initial transitive dependent libraries with the Idea project.\r\n\r\n 7. There are options in the Idea Maven tool window which will allow you to synchronize further changes to dependent libraries or javadoc and source code in libraries.\r\n\r\n 8. Selects a JDK and attaches it to the project, automatically downloading the  selected JDK version if not already present.\r\n\r\n 9. Sets an appropriate language level for the project.\r\n\r\nWhen you just use the create new Java Project option, it doesn’t do any of those things, so you need to do things manually instead, which is what the rest of that tutorial is about:\r\n\r\n 1. Manually download the JDK and configure it in the SDK.\r\n\r\n 2. Manually download the JavaFX SDK and add the libraries from it to your project.\r\n\r\n 3. Manually configure VM modular arguments.\r\n\r\n 4. Manually maintain any other dependencies.\r\n\r\n 5. Manually associate javadoc and source code.\r\n\r\n 6. Manually write the code for a basic application.\r\n\r\n 7. Manually set the project language level.\r\n\r\nDoing all this stuff manually is more work and more error prone.  The manual work usually leads to a worse outcome and a project that is more difficult to maintain for many people getting started with JavaFX, so I do not recommend it.\r\n\r\n*Versions*\r\n\r\nIn terms of the versions to use, I recommend using the most recent stable (non-beta) releases of both JDK and JavaFX, regardless of what versions may be referenced in any tutorials you may be using.  \r\n\r\nYou can set JavaFX versions in the Maven file generated by the new JavaFX project wizard, then press the button in the Maven Tool window to synchronize the Maven project with the Idea project.\r\n\r\n*Language level settings*\r\n\r\nThese are important later on, but pretty irrelevant when just getting started.\r\n \r\nThe language level settings:\r\n\r\n 1. Tell the compiler what version of the java byte code to compile the application to.\r\n\r\n 2. Tell the IDE what language syntax rules to enforce and provide help with.  \r\n\r\nIf you use Java 17 only features, the app won’t run on a Java 11 VM.  \r\n\r\nYou can define the settings in Idea manually:\r\n\r\n * [language setting level](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/javafx.html).\r\n\r\nBut it is better to set them in the [compiler section of the maven project](https://www.baeldung.com/maven-java-version) and synchronize the project with Idea, which will also configure the settings in the IDE.\r\n\r\nIMO, set it to the most recent stable version and have a requirement that your application be run with that Java version as a minimum (you can enforce that by using jlink or jpackage to bundle the JRE version you choose with your packaged app).","title":"JavaFX and IntelliJ no errors althought the documentation says I should have some","body":"<p>The current documentation in the openjfx tutorial for getting started with JavaFX using Idea is incorrect, at least for recent Idea releases (2021.3 +).</p>\n<p>The tutorial is written as though a new Java project was created, rather than a new JavaFX project.
