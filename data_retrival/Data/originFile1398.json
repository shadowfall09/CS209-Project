First you identified the outer element then using that you are identifying the inner element.

Here is my code:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>import javax.swing.*;\nimport java.awt.*;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionEvent;\nimport java.awt.event.ActionListener;\n\n\n\npublic class MathQuiz extends JFrame \nimplements ActionListener {\n\nprivate JLabel questionNmbr = new JLabel\n(&quot;Select # of      questions:&quot;);\nprivate JTextField questionTxt = new JTextField(8);\nprivate JLabel questionTypes = new JLabel\n(&quot;Select wanted question types:&quot;);\nprivate JCheckBox addition = new JCheckBox(&quot;+&quot;);\nprivate JCheckBox subtraction = new JCheckBox(&quot;-&quot;);\nprivate JCheckBox multiplication = new JCheckBox(&quot;x&quot;);\nprivate JCheckBox division = new JCheckBox(&quot;÷&quot;);\nprivate JLabel difficulty = new JLabel\n(&quot;Choose difficulty:&quot;);\nprivate JRadioButton easy = new JRadioButton(&quot;Easy&quot;);\nprivate JRadioButton medium = new JRadioButton(&quot;Medium&quot;);\nprivate JRadioButton hard = new JRadioButton(&quot;Hard&quot;);\nprivate JButton submit = new JButton(&quot;Submit&quot;);\n\n//whether or not each is chosen\nprivate int aNmbr = 0;\nprivate int sNmbr = 0;\nprivate int mNmbr = 0;\nprivate int dNmbr = 0;\n\n//how many questions each operation will have\nprivate int aQs = 0;\nprivate int sQs = 0;\nprivate int mQs = 0;\nprivate int dQs = 0;\n\npublic MathQuiz() {\n\n    //grouping radio btns\n    ButtonGroup level = new ButtonGroup();\n    level.add(easy);\n    level.add(medium);\n    level.add(hard);\n    easy.addActionListener(this);\n    medium.addActionListener(this);\n    hard.addActionListener(this);\n    submit.addActionListener(this);\n\n    setTitle(&quot;Quiz&quot;);\n    setSize(400, 400);\n    setLocationRelativeTo(null);\n    setDefaultCloseOperation(EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n    setLayout(new FlowLayout());\n\n\n    add(questionNmbr);\n    add(questionTxt);\n    add(questionTypes);\n    add(addition);\n    add(subtraction);\n    add(multiplication);\n    add(division);\n    add(difficulty);\n    add(easy);\n    add(medium);\n    add(hard);\n    add(submit);\n\n\n    setVisible(true);\n\n\n}\n\n\npublic void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\n    Object obj = e.getSource();\n    Object obj2 = e.getSource();\n\n    //prints out the test\n    if (obj == submit) {\n        int QNmbr = Integer.parseInt(questionTxt.getText());\n\n        int[] aVal1 = \nnew int[Integer.parseInt(questionTxt.getText())];\n        int[] aVal2 = \nnew int[Integer.parseInt(questionTxt.getText())];\n\n        try {\n            Integer.parseInt(questionTxt.getText());\n        } catch (NumberFormatException f) {\n            JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this,\n                    &quot;Please enter a number&quot;);\n        }\n\n\n\n        if (obj == addition) {\n            aNmbr = 1;\n        }\n\n        if (obj == subtraction) {\n            sNmbr = 1;\n        }\n\n        if (obj == multiplication) {\n            mNmbr = 1;\n        }\n\n        if (obj == division) {\n            dNmbr = 1;\n        }\n\n\n        //if easy is chosen\n        if (obj == easy) {\n\n\n            if(obj2 == addition) {\n                for(int i = 0;

figure this out for over a year now but I can't run JUnit5 suites unless I use the JUnit4 @RunWith annotation, which brings me some other issues. I'm trying to use the newer <code>@Suite</code> annotation instead but no matter what I try (name the test ending with IT, Test, run through IntelliJ, run through maven, include tag, exclude tag, etc), I keep getting the tests no found error. I think I'm really running out of ideas at this stage and would love someone to point it out what is it that I may still be missing.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

I set it all up correctly and tried running it but it failed due to being an external IP... my organisation won't allow us to use it so suggested we download and compile the source internally and use it this way..</p>\n<p>The source code is avaialble at: <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowTemplates\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowTemplates</a></p>\n<p>I have took an exact copy of this repo and saved it to my local pc. I have then ensured I have Java 8 sdk installed and running on my pc. In my head it should be easy right? an exact copy of their code? should just compile instantly?</p>\n<p>I keep getting the below error though.. and can't figure out what I am doing wrong... is anyone else able to take this repo and install it locally?</p>\n<p>To confirm I run the mvn install command and get the below output..

For example: if one treasureCode is both a &quot;perfect number&quot; and an &quot;even number with the sum of digits divisible by 3&quot;, the status will be updated according to &quot;perfect number&quot; because this criterion precedes the other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've made the perfect and prime number algorithms, but for example when I enter number 6 which is a perfect number, it increases for prime number too.</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>package game;\n\npublic class PlayerStatus {\n    \n    public void findArtifact(int artifactCode) {\n        int sum = 1;\n        for (int i = 2; i &lt; artifactCode; i++) {\n            if (artifactCode % i == 0) {\n                sum += i;\n            }\n        }\n        if (sum == artifactCode) {\n            this.score += 5000;\n            this.lives += 1;\n            this.health = 100;\n        }\n        for (int i = 2; i &lt; artifactCode / 2; i++) {\n            if (artifactCode % i == 0) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        this.score += 1000;\n        this.lives += 2;\n        this.health += 25;\n     }\n\npackage game;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n    PlayerStatus player1 = new PlayerStatus();\n        player1.findArtifact(6);\n        System.out.println(player1.getScore());\n        System.out.println(player1.getLives());\n        System.out.println(player1.getHealth());\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the output:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>6000</li>\n<li>3</li>\n<li>125</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I know it's easy, but I have a mental breakdown.

also wanted to be able to mock a ResultSet with multiple rows and found various answers online but none of them seemed to meet my needs.\r\n\r\nIn my case I have a class method (SUT) that iterates through a(n) (unknown) number of rows and perform some logic on them (in production runtime). I am trying to ensure that the correct objects that get built from these rows are returned.

(This gives you the opportunity to control the borders very carefully, so you can avoid double borders, etc.) Then add the content to each pane. You can also register the mouse listeners with the pane, which means you don&#39;t have to do the ugly math to figure out which cell was clicked.\r\n\r\nThe recommended way to apply a border to any region is to use CSS and a &quot;nested background&quot; approach. In this approach, you draw two (or more) background fills on the region, with different insets, giving the appearance of a border. So for example:\r\n\r\n    -fx-background-fill: black, white ;\r\n    -fx-background-insets: 0, 1 ;\r\n\r\nwill first draw a black background with no insets, and then over that will draw a white background with insets of 1 pixel on all sides, giving the appearance of a black border of width 1 pixel. While this may seem counter-intuitive, the performance of this is (allegedly) better than specifying border directly. You can also specify a sequence of four values for the insets for *each* fill, which are interpreted as the insets on the top, right, bottom, and left, respectively.

If you wish to use an awt canvas in JavaFX, see:\r\n\r\n * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17071904/interoperability-between-graphics2d-and-graphicscontext\r\n\r\nSpecifically, consider using the [FXGraphics2D](https://www.jfree.org/fxgraphics2d/) library:\r\n\r\n&gt; FXGraphics2D is an implementation of Java2D&#39;s Graphics2D API that targets a JavaFX canvas.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n&gt; Maven doesn&#39;t know a javafx.embed.swing.

(I know that this is fixed in Java 9, but unfortunately, I must use Java 8.) This means that, once the GC determines that the main object is not strongly reachable, and enqueues the phantom reference, it still cannot reclaim the memory of the main object, until I manually clear the phantom reference after I dequeue it in `checkDiscarded()`. I am concerned that, during the period of time between the GC enqueuing the phantom reference and me dequeueing it from the queue, the main object will remain in memory when it&#39;s unnecessary. My main object references many other objects which take a lot of memory, so I would not want it staying in memory for longer than without this feature.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this problem of the phantom reference preventing the main object from being reclaimed, I came up with the idea of using a dummy object as the referrent of the phantom reference instead of my main object. This dummy object will be referenced from my main object, so it will become unreachable at the same time as my main object. Since the dummy object will be small, I don&#39;t mind it not being reclaimed for longer period of time, as long as my main object will be reclaimed as soon as it&#39;s not reachable. Does this seem like a good idea, and is it really better than using the main object as the referrent?\r\n\r\n\r\n    class MainObject {\r\n        static class MyPhantom extends PhantomReference&lt;Object&gt; {\r\n            static Set&lt;MyPhantom&gt; phantomSet = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\r\n            MyPhantom(Object obj, ReferenceQueue&lt;Object&gt; queue) {\r\n                super(obj, queue);\r\n                phantomSet.add(this);\r\n            }\r\n            void clear() {\r\n                super.clear();\r\n                phantomSet.remove(this);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        Object dummyObject = new Object();\r\n        MyPhantom myPhantom = new MyPhantom(dummyObject, referenceQueue);\r\n        static ReferenceQueue&lt;Object&gt; referenceQueue = new ReferenceQueue&lt;&gt;();\r\n        void markUsed() {\r\n            myPhantom.clear();\r\n            myPhantom = null;\r\n        }\r\n        static void checkDiscarded() { // run periodically\r\n            while ((aPhantom = (MyPhantom) referenceQueue.poll()) != null) {\r\n                aPhantom.clear();\r\n                // do stuff with aPhantom\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnother idea I am considering is to use weak references instead of phantom references. Unlike phantom references in Java 8, weak references are cleared when they are enqueued, so it does not prevent the referrent from being reclaimed. I understand that the reason why phantom references are usually used for resource cleanup, is that phantom references are only enqueued after the referrent is finalized and guaranteed to not be used anymore, whereas weak references are enqueued before being finalized, and so resources cannot be freed yet, and also the finalizer might resurrect the object. However, that&#39;s not a concern in my case, as I am not &quot;cleaning up&quot; any resources, but just making a report that my main object was discarded before being used, which can be done while the object is still in memory. My main objects also do not have a `finalize()` method, so there is no concern of resurrecting the object.
