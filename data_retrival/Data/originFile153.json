The JavaDoc for Wallet says to use classes from *org.xrpl.xrpl4j.core.wallet*. But the &#39;core&#39; part of the package doesn&#39;t exist.\r\n\r\nSo, I cloned the *xrpl4j* v3.2 (no .1) repo from Github into Eclipse.

Class: DexBackedClassDef and ClassDef\r\n 2. Method: DexBackedMethod and Method\r\n 3. Field: DexBackedField and Field\r\n 4. MethodImplementation: DexBackedMethodImplementation and MethodImplementation\r\n 5. MethodReference: DexBackedMethodReference and ........ and so on.\r\n \r\nSo basically you can read each object using two classes- one is Dexbacked and another is direct.\r\nthe difference is- DexBackedObject has only pointers on the loaded dex file. they do not hold a single data. when fields and methods of these Objects are called, that time they read them from dex file. otherwise they are empty.\r\nunlike them, direct Objects are already filled with data.\r\n\r\nthen there comes-\r\n 1.

ClassDefs,Methods,Fields,Instructions,Annotations.. and throw them to your methods.\r\nyour defined methods will either edit them or return them as is. from there, it will use them to write a new dex file.\r\n\r\n    DexRewriter rewriter = new DexRewriter  // the DexRewriter which will do the actual reading and writing of dex file. but its only parameter is a &#39;middleMan&#39; method.\r\n    new RewriterModule() {} // this is our middle man\r\n    public Rewriter&lt;String&gt; getTypeRewriter(Rewriters rewriters) {} // this is our first worker which works under this middle man boss. this worker is expert in throwing found Types (like Lbla/bla/bla;) and getting modified ones from you.\r\n    \r\n    // there can be many workers expert in different things. such as StringRewriter, MethodRewriters etc. you can also add them below it using @override.\r\n    \r\n    //for example, MethodRewriter will throw all found methods at you and collect them as you modify or return as is.\r\n    \r\n    public String rewrite(String value) {} //write code that edits throwed objects under this method.\r\n    //for example i want to replace Lmybla; to Lyourbla; everywhere in dex file- so i will write following code-\r\n    public String rewrite(String value) {\r\n        if(value.equals(&quot;Lmybla;&quot;){ \r\n            return &quot;Lyourbla;&quot;;  //return edited.\r\n        }else{\r\n            return value; //dont touch, return as it.\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nthis example code was for types. which are just strings. but if you want to edit a .. for example lets say.. .a field. then you have to return a ImmutableField object.\r\n\r\n    if(someCondition){\r\n       return new ImmutableField(value.definingClass,value.Type,value.name);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nsomething like this.\r\n\r\nSecond method to edit a dex file-\r\n---------------------------------\r\nsecond method is to use dexPool.\r\ndexPool has many pools. such as stringPool, methodPool, fieldPool etc.\r\ndexPool reads classes, methods etc using its intern() method.\r\nand it collects all interend items in its pools.\r\nso after interning a whole dex file, its StringPool is full of all strings found all over the dex file..MethodPool is full of.... and so on.\r\nthen it rearrange all these pools in dex file format and write a dex file.\r\n\r\nso if you want to edit something. first make a list of ClassDefs of orignal dex file.\r\nthen pick up a ClassDef you want to edit. then replace it with new ImmutableClassDef\r\n\r\nthen make dexPool intern all classDefs of list. and make a new output dex file.\r\n\r\ni am working with this dexlib2 for 4 months now. i hope i summarize it well. thank you.\r\n\r\n","title":"How to use org.jf.dexlib2 write or rewrite dex file?","body":"<p>you have two ways to rewrite dex file. but before, you need to understand some basics.\nfirst of all, dex file has classes. each class has fields and methods. fields are simple. but methods has method implementation. which is actually the code. that implementation(code) is made of instructions. these instructions are of many types.\nfor example instruction21c is for &quot;const-string&quot;.\nyou can read each of these from dex in the following objects-</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Class: DexBackedClassDef and ClassDef</li>\n<li>Method: DexBackedMethod and Method</li>\n<li>Field: DexBackedField and Field</li>\n<li>MethodImplementation: DexBackedMethodImplementation and MethodImplementation</li>\n<li>MethodReference: DexBackedMethodReference and ........ and so on.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So basically you can read each object using two classes- one is Dexbacked and another is direct.\nthe difference is- DexBackedObject has only pointers on the loaded dex file. they do not hold a single data. when fields and methods of these Objects are called, that time they read them from dex file. otherwise they are empty.\nunlike them, direct Objects are already filled with data.</p>\n<p>then there comes-</p>\n<ol>\n<li>MethodReference</li>\n<li>FieldReference</li>\n<li>TypeReference</li>\n<li>StringReference</li>\n</ol>\n<p>these all are part of MethodImplementation(code). for example</p>\n<pre><code>const-string v1, &quot;hellow World&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>this instruction is instruction21c.\nthis instruction's opcode is &quot;const-string&quot;\nthis instruction's RegisterA = v1\nthis instruction's Reference is type of StringReference.</p>\n<p>lets take another example-</p>\n<p>invoke-static p0, Lmyclass;-&gt;myMethod(LmyParam1;LmyParam2;):LmyRetType;</p>\n<p>this whole line makes a single instructions in a method implementation.\nthis instruction's reference is type of MethodReference.\ni hope you understand what is meaning of xxxxxReference classes.</p>\n<p>then we comes to ImmutableXXXXXXXXXX- what are these?\nfor example- ImmutableClassDef, ImmutableMethod, ImmutableMethodReference etc..\nok, they are same thing as above, if you want to change something you have to create a new ImmutableXXXXX. for example if i want to change the <code>const-string v1,&quot;hellow world&quot;

Null equates to the SQLite *, which stands for all columns (in your case all columns is just the 1 column, so null is simple).\r\n\r\nSo after a move????, if the move can be undertaken then true will be returned, if the move could not be undertaken (e.g. empty cursor, end of cursor) then false is returned. hence the while loop (for all rows) and the if for just the first row. Additionally the cursor will be positioned at the row.\r\n\r\nYou can then extract data from the column(s), you access a column according to it&#39;s offset. So the first column is at offset 0, the second at 1 ....\r\n\r\nSo to get the value from the first column you can use a `get????` method, where ???? is the type of the data. You want a String value so the `getString` method is apt. So you could have:-\r\n\r\n    String theString = csr.getString(0);\r\n\r\nOr perhaps even :-\r\n\r\n    Text_test.setText(csr.getString(0));\r\n\r\n**Tying it all Up**\r\n\r\nUsing your DBHelper class, just modified to eliminate the errors.

Again, there are several ways to do this, for example:\r\n```java\r\nrectangle.substring(0, rectangle.lastIndexOf(System.lineSeparator()))\r\n```\r\nRefer to the *javadoc* for class [StringBuilder][1].\r\n\r\nHere is method `getRectangle` with the above change.\r\n```java\r\npublic static String getRectangle(int maxRows, int maxCols, char symbol) {\r\n    if (maxRows &lt; 1 || maxCols &lt; 1) {\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n    StringBuilder rectangle = new StringBuilder();\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; maxRows; i++) {\r\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; maxCols; j++) {\r\n            rectangle.append(symbol);\r\n        }\r\n        rectangle.append(System.lineSeparator());\r\n    }\r\n    return rectangle.substring(0, rectangle.lastIndexOf(System.lineSeparator()));\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAlternatively, you can change the logic of your nested `for` loops. Instead of appending a line separator, prepend it for every line except for the first line, as demonstrated in the below `getOblong` method.\r\n```java\r\npublic static String getOblong(int maxRows, int maxCols, char symbol) {\r\n    boolean first = true;\r\n    StringBuilder rectangle = new StringBuilder();\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; maxRows; i++) {\r\n        if (first) {\r\n            first = false;\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            rectangle.append(System.lineSeparator());\r\n        }\r\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; maxCols; j++) {\r\n            rectangle.append(symbol);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return rectangle.toString();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nActually, you don&#39;t need to use loops as there are already API methods that achieve the same result, as demonstrated in the below `getRect` method:\r\n```java\r\npublic static String getRect(int rows, int cols, char symbol) {\r\n    String s = String.valueOf(symbol);\r\n    String line = s.repeat(cols);\r\n    String[] lines = new String[rows];\r\n    java.util.Arrays.fill(lines, line);\r\n    return String.join(System.lineSeparator(), lines);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAgain, refer to *javadoc* for class [String][2].\r\n\r\nBy the way, since you are already checking validity of parameters `maxRows` and `maxCols`, in your `getRectangle` method, shouldn&#39;t you also check whether `symbol` is a [printable character][3]?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/StringBuilder.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/220547/printable-char-in-java","title":"Removing an extra line separator","body":"<p>There are several ways to remove the final line separator from the string returned by method <code>getRectangle</code>.</p>\n<p>One way – that minimizes the required changes to your code – is to simply remove the final line separator before returning the value.

Both a C# namespace and a Java package are meant to **organize classes**. \r\nThey do have some clear differences though.\r\n\r\n&gt; **[1]** Virtual?\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; In ***Java***, the package name must be identical to the folder path relative to the source folder. For example; Imagine we have a class called `Hello`;\r\n&gt; ```java\r\n&gt; public class Hello { }\r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt; We want `Hello` to be in the `com.example.hello` package. To accomplish this, we have to first move the Java file for public class `Hello` (In our case `Hello.java`) to the folder `&lt;source folder&gt;/com/example/hello`. (Replace `&lt;source folder&gt;` with the source folder, for example; `src` for normal Java, `src/main/java` for Maven and Gradle, etc.). The second thing we have to do is add `package com.example.hello` to the beginning of our `Hello.java` file.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; The reason that Java requires you do this is because the Java Class Loader pulls the classes from the `jar` based on the `&lt;package(with /)&gt;.&lt;class&gt;.class` path format. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; In ***C#*** this is not required. Namespaces are completely virtual there. So lets define `Hello` again, but this time we want it in the `Example.Test` namespace. \r\n&gt; ```C#\r\n&gt; class Hello { }\r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt; Here all we have to do is nest our class declaration in two sets of namespace scopes.\r\n&gt; Like this;\r\n&gt; ```C#\r\n&gt; namespace Example {\r\n&gt;    namespace Test {\r\n&gt;        class Hello { }\r\n&gt;    }\r\n&gt; }\r\n&gt; ```  \r\n\r\n&gt; **[2]** Naming conventions\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; This is not a major difference in functionality, but it is definitely a notable one.\r\n&gt; In Java you often name the packages like this; `me.name.app.category` Sometimes people also use something like `me.name.App.category` or other variants, but you rarely see people use `Me.Name.App.Category` in Java, while that is exactly how most people name their namespaces in C#. \r\n\r\n&gt; **[3]** Modules\r\n&gt; Another major difference is that Java actually uses packages for modules as well, not just for named categories. I don&#39;t know a lot about this topic so I won&#39;t explain it as I may give false information.\r\n\r\n&gt; **[4]** Access\r\n&gt; In Java, packages can also act as a way to limit access to a certain symbol. \r\n&gt; For example, lets say that we have a class structure like this;\r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt; com \r\n&gt;  ↳ example\r\n&gt;    ↳ hello\r\n&gt;      ↳ Hello (class)\r\n&gt;    ↳ bye\r\n&gt;       ↳ interfaces\r\n&gt;          ↳ IBye (class)\r\n&gt;       ↳ Bye (class)\r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt; And the `Bye` class is declared like this;\r\n&gt; ```java\r\n&gt; package com.example.bye;\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; public class Bye {\r\n&gt;    public static void say() {\r\n&gt;        System.out.println(&quot;Bye!&quot;);\r\n&gt;    }\r\n&gt; }\r\n&gt; ```\r\n&gt; And the main method is contained inside of the `Hello` class.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Okay so right now, we can access `Bye.say()` from anywhere in the application, because it is marked as `public`. So in this case we can safely call it from both `Hello` and `IBye`.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; But what if we didn&#39;t want that, what if we only wanted it to be accessible from the package it is in. Then we just need to replace the `public` in the `say()` method declaration with nothing. This will prevent any class that is not in that package from accessing the method, field, class or constructor. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; There is something that you&#39;ll have to note though.

Both a C# namespace and a Java package are meant to <strong>organize classes</strong>.\nThey do have some clear differences though.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>[1]</strong> Virtual?</p>\n<p>In <em><strong>Java</strong></em>, the package name must be identical to the folder path relative to the source folder. For example; Imagine we have a class called <code>Hello</code>;</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class Hello { }\n</code></pre>\n<p>We want <code>Hello</code> to be in the <code>com.example.hello</code> package. To accomplish this, we have to first move the Java file for public class <code>Hello</code> (In our case <code>Hello.java</code>) to the folder <code>&lt;source folder&gt;/com/example/hello</code>. (Replace <code>&lt;source folder&gt;</code> with the source folder, for example; <code>src</code> for normal Java, <code>src/main/java</code> for Maven and Gradle, etc.). The second thing we have to do is add <code>package com.example.hello</code> to the beginning of our <code>Hello.java</code> file.</p>\n<p>The reason that Java requires you do this is because the Java Class Loader pulls the classes from the <code>jar</code> based on the <code>&lt;package(with /)&gt;.&lt;class&gt;.class</code> path format.</p>\n<p>In <em><strong>C#</strong></em> this is not required. Namespaces are completely virtual there. So lets define <code>Hello</code> again, but this time we want it in the <code>Example.Test</code> namespace.</p>\n<pre><code>class Hello { }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here all we have to do is nest our class declaration in two sets of namespace scopes.\nLike this;</p>\n<pre><code>namespace Example {\n   namespace Test {\n       class Hello { }\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>[2]</strong> Naming conventions</p>\n<p>This is not a major difference in functionality, but it is definitely a notable one.\nIn Java you often name the packages like this; <code>me.name.app.category</code> Sometimes people also use something like <code>me.name.App.category</code> or other variants, but you rarely see people use <code>Me.Name.App.Category</code> in Java, while that is exactly how most people name their namespaces in C#.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>[3]</strong> Modules\nAnother major difference is that Java actually uses packages for modules as well, not just for named categories. I don't know a lot about this topic so I won't explain it as I may give false information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>[4]</strong> Access\nIn Java, packages can also act as a way to limit access to a certain symbol.\nFor example, lets say that we have a class structure like this;</p>\n<pre><code>com \n ↳ example\n   ↳ hello\n     ↳ Hello (class)\n   ↳ bye\n      ↳ interfaces\n         ↳ IBye (class)\n      ↳ Bye (class)\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the <code>Bye</code> class is declared like this;</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>package com.example.bye;\n\npublic class Bye {\n   public static void say() {\n       System.out.println(&quot;Bye!&quot;);\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the main method is contained inside of the <code>Hello</code> class.</p>\n<p>Okay so right now, we can access <code>Bye.say()</code> from anywhere in the application, because it is marked as <code>public</code>. So in this case we can safely call it from both <code>Hello</code> and <code>IBye</code>.</p>\n<p>But what if we didn't want that, what if we only wanted it to be accessible from the package it is in. Then we just need to replace the <code>public</code> in the <code>say()</code> method declaration with nothing. This will prevent any class that is not in that package from accessing the method, field, class or constructor.</p>\n<p>There is something that you'll have to note though. Remember the <code>IBye</code> class? Well, technically it is in the same package as <code>Bye</code>, but just deeper. Sadly Java does not account for this so we are not able to access it from sub-packages.</p>\n<p><strong>Extra Information</strong>\nNow there are more access modifiers in Java, but I won't explain them all here.\nBut there are of course some really useful sites on this topic, so here they are;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.javatpoint.com/accessmodifiers#:%7E:text=There%20are%20four%20types%20of%20Java%20access%20modifiers%3A,level%20of%20a%20public%20modifier%20is%20everywhere.%20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.javatpoint.com/accessmodifiers#:~:text=There%20are%20four%20types%20of%20Java%20access%20modifiers%3A,level%20of%20a%20public%20modifier%20is%20everywhere.%20</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-6.html#jls-6.6.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-6.html#jls-6.6.1</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>In a nutshell</strong>\nThey may look similar and are generally intended for the same purpose, but Java packages are not virtual, have a different naming convention and manage modules and access modifiers.</p>\n<p><strong>C#-like emulation</strong>\nIn Java, you can try to replicate the C# namespace system using Nested classes.\nBecause;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Java classes have the same naming convention as C# namespaces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Nested classes are completely virtual and can be moved by just moving the declaration to a different class scope.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So imagine that we wanted to put our <code>Hello</code> class in 'namespace' <code>Example.Test</code>, what we could do is this;</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public class Example {\n   public static class Test {\n       public static class Hello { }\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1051929,"reputation":13594,"user_id":1055637,"accept_rate":63,"display_name":"Mazzy"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":103006,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":10,"up_vote_count":127,"accepted_answer_id":9249506,"answer_count":7,"score":117,"last_activity_date":1695972713,"creation_date":1329055233,"question_id":9249357,"body_markdown":"What is the difference (in terms of use) between namespaces in C# and packages in Java?","title":"Difference between namespace in C# and package in Java","body":"<p>What is the difference (in terms of use) between namespaces in C# and packages in Java?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","boot"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":402229,"reputation":93994,"user_id":769265,"display_name":"David Wasser"},"score":0,"creation_date":1695979797,"post_id":77200118,"comment_id":136098236,"body_markdown":"Add logging in `onReceive()` so that you can determine if the boot receiver is being called.

You explain that anomalies such as Daylight Saving Time (DST) can result in invalid values. \r\n\r\n    ZonedDateTime zdt = myLocalDateTime.atZone( myZoneId );\r\n\r\nThis is true. There is no perfect solution when landing in the DST “Spring-forward” or ”Fall-back” cutovers. However, the java.time classes *do* resolve the ambiguity by adopting a certain policy. You may or may not agree with that policy. But if you do agree, then you can rely on java.time to determine a result.\r\n\r\nTo quote the documentation for [`ZonedDateTime.ofLocal`][3]:\r\n\r\n&gt;In the case of an overlap, where clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets. If the preferred offset is one of the valid offsets then it is used. Otherwise the earlier valid offset is used, typically corresponding to &quot;summer&quot;.\r\n\r\n&gt;In the case of a gap, where clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset. Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap. For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to &quot;summer&quot;.\r\n\r\n        LocalDate modifiedJulianEpoch = LocalDate.of( 1858 , 11 , 17 );\r\n        LocalDate today = LocalDate.now( ZoneOffset.UTC );\r\n        long days = ChronoUnit.DAYS.between (  modifiedJulianEpoch , today );\r\n\r\n&gt;today: 2017-03-19\r\n&gt;days: 57831\r\n\r\nI do not quite understand your issues. But it seems to me that the point of MJD (Modified Julian Days) is to have a way to track a “One True Time” to avoid all the confusion of time zones.

January 1 is `1`, January 2 is `2`, December 31 is `365` (or `366` in leap years).\r\n\r\nThis loose (incorrect) use of `Julian` probably comes from the [use in astronomy][4] and other fields of tracking dates as a continuous count of days since noon Universal Time on January 1, 4713 BCE (on the [Julian calendar][5]). Nowadays the Julian date is approaching two and half million, `2,457,576` today. \r\n\r\n# java.time\r\n\r\nThe java.time framework built into Java 8 and later provides an easy facility to get the day-of-year. \r\n\r\nThe `LocalDate` class represents a date-only value without time-of-day and without time zone. You can interrogate for the day-of-year.\r\n\r\n    LocalDate localDate = LocalDate.of ( 2010 , Month.JUNE , 8 );\r\n    int dayOfYear = localDate.getDayOfYear ();\r\n\r\nDump to console. Results show that June 8, 2010 is indeed day # 159.\r\n\r\n    System.out.println ( &quot;localDate: &quot; + localDate + &quot; | dayOfYear: &quot; + dayOfYear );\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;localDate: 2010-06-08 | dayOfYear: 159\r\n\r\nA time zone is crucial in determining a date.

One of the common reasons is nesting layouts like LazyRow and Row(Modifier.horizontalScroll()). If you want to add a header before the list of items please add a header as a separate item() before the main items() inside the LazyRow scope. There are could be other reasons for this to happen: your ComposeView was added into a LinearLayout with some weight, you applied Modifier.wrapContentSize(unbounded = true) or wrote a custom layout. Please try to remove the source of infinite constraints in the hierarchy above the scrolling container.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan anyone please help me to fix this out. I&#39;m stuck.

You&#39;ll also find instructions to add this certificate to your OS trusted root certificates.  \r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re working with servlet apps, I suggest that you use [any port but 8080][2] when using https.\r\n\r\n## Follow-up from comments\r\nThe option above allows to serve `https://myhost.com:8080` instead of `http://myhost.com:8080` (but as mentioned above, because of historical reasons, using `https://myhost.com:8443` in servlet apps would be much easier).\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t want the traffic to your Spring app to be secured and want to keep `http://myhost.com:8080`, then you have to configure the authorization code redirection URI to `https://myhost.com/login/oauth2/code/google`, as you&#39;re trying to do in properties.

If followed exactly, it will likely work for you.  If you deviate from the steps in any way, there are no guarantees it will work, nor that I will support you much with it.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m just going to note what to do without a lot of explanation.  \r\n\r\nThe basic approach is to:\r\n\r\n 1. Create one module with the custom control(s) needed.  \r\n 2. Import the module with the custom controls into SceneBuilder.\r\n 3. Use SceneBuilder to design your app using your custom controls.\r\n 4. Create a new project for the app which uses the FXML generated by SceneBuilder.  The new project depends on the custom control module for functionality.\r\n 5. Build and run the application project.\r\n\r\nIdea can create and work with multi-module maven projects, so the multiple modules can be in a single project (which might be a reasonable approach for this), but that setup is more complex and not core to solving your problem, so I did not document it here.\r\n\r\n## Step 1: Create a JavaFX Project for your Custom Component\r\n\r\nIn Idea -&gt;

Also the JavaFX version is 19.  These are set to match the version of SceneBuilder used.  SceneBuilder 19 can only understand JavaFX 19 components (and lower) and runs on JDK 17, so can only understand JAR files compiled to Java 17 (or lower).  If you try using a higher target JDK for building your custom component than SceneBuilder understands, then it won&#39;t find your component in the JAR file to import it.\r\n\r\nAs you can see for the execution project you don&#39;t have the same restrictions, so it can freely run on JavaFX 20 and JDK 20 with no issue.\r\n\r\n## Related\r\n\r\n * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29444698/how-to-create-an-fxml-file-for-an-already-created-new-component-in-java-than-add/29444845#29444845\r\n\r\n    Especially see the section titled &quot;Component Pre-requisites&quot; in the linked related answer, which some code requirements for the custom components you create (not all of which are intuitive).\r\n\r\n * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70985646/load-custom-components-in-scenebuilder-17/70988201#70988201\r\n\r\n    The above is for importing 3rd party libraries into SceneBuilder which is a bit simpler than creating libraries yourself as was demonstrated in this answer.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/7mVPF.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/qZad9.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/nLEGZ.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Se1MI.png\r\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/VPiKV.png\r\n  [6]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/teXU7.png","title":"JavaFX custom component usage in SceneBuilder","body":"<p>This answer is long, but there is a lot going on so it is what it is.</p>\n<p>These steps worked for me.

SceneBuilder 19 can only understand JavaFX 19 components (and lower) and runs on JDK 17, so can only understand JAR files compiled to Java 17 (or lower).

Although this isn't really idiomatic to how a <code>List</code> with one element should be created, it solves your question.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":29560881,"reputation":1,"user_id":22655427,"display_name":"Marcus Altman"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1695967772,"creation_date":1695967772,"answer_id":77199766,"question_id":26847696,"body_markdown":"This returns an immutable list containing the elements provided as arguments:\r\n\r\n    return List.of(elements);\r\n","title":"create a list, add an element and return it to the caller in one statement","body":"<p>This returns an immutable list containing the elements provided as arguments:</p>\n<pre><code>return List.of(elements);\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":4400297,"reputation":498,"user_id":3586195,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"user3586195"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":6354,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"accepted_answer_id":26847735,"answer_count":2,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1695967772,"creation_date":1415634958,"question_id":26847696,"body_markdown":"Is there a way to create a list and add an element and return the resulting list in one statement ?\r\n\r\n    return new ArrayList&lt;Email&gt;().add(email); \r\n\r\nAbove does not work for obvious reasons.
