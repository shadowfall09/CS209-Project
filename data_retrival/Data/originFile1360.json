The source and target parameters define the versions of java to use for source code and bytecode, and are usually the same.\r\n\r\nPassing arguments to the compiler is an utter trainwreck. See the separate section on that below here. In this example I use the properties setting which allows me to provide detailed settings on which errors and warnings I want to have when compiling things. By using the ${project.basedir} variable inside the parameter I have these settings per project: every project is required to have a .settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs file present (which is by happy chance the location where the Eclipse IDE leaves its compiler settings).\r\n\r\nThe dependency on plexus-codehaus-eclipse defines the plugin that knows how to run the Eclipse compiler. The 2.8.3 version was the latest at the time of writing but this version has a few issues. Version 2.8.4 should come with a rewritten interface to the compiler which fixes a lot of issues, but this version is still in the works at the time of writing. You can [find details on the plugin here](https://github.com/codehaus-plexus/plexus-compiler), so progress can be followed on new releases/code changes.\r\n\r\nThe other important dependency is the org.eclipse.jdt:ecj dependency: this one specifies the **exact version of the ecj compiler to use**. You should always specify it because otherwise build stability will suffer when the plugin decides to use another version of the compiler one day before you have a big release ;) The version number to use for the ecj compiler is a bit of a problem. You might be able to find the version number from [the list of releases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software)#Releases) and then check [this maven repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler/ecj) for something that looks like it. But this repository only contains the older versions. When you need a more recent release you should apparently [look here at this one](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.jdt/ecj) - this is where Eclipse [currently pushes its versions](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=499019). This newer repository does away with the easily recognizable version numbers of the earlier one; it uses version numbers like 3.1x.x as seen above. Eclipse usually has a major release once every year plus one or two fix releases in between. The second part in the 3.13.x number corresponds to the internal versioning used inside the Eclipse Platform project for releases. It is hard to get by a list but at least these are known:\r\n\r\n    Version    Eclipse Release      Compiler Version\r\n    3.13.0     Oxygen Release       4.7\r\n    3.13.50    Oxygen 1a            4.7.1a\r\n    3.13.100   Oxygen R2            4.7.2\r\n\r\nThe version always starts with 3, the 13 is more or less the &quot;year&quot; of the release. So when 13 is Oxygen (2017, 4.7) 14 will probably be Photon (2018, 4.8).\r\n\r\nVersions of the plexus-compiler-eclipse plugin: before 2.8.4\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\nVersions before 2.8.4 of the plexus-compiler-plugin used an internal API to start the Eclipse compiler. This causes a lot of things not to work that well, as this internal API, for instance, does not interpret the usual command line parameters of the ecj compiler. This makes it quite hard to use, and some things are not supported. The following is a list of restrictions:\r\n\r\n* Annotations processing is not implemented. Any configuration is silently ignored.\r\n\r\n* Adding specific parameters by using the &amp;lt;compilerArguments&amp;gt; tag is hard as there are multiple problems with the implementation:\r\n\r\n* The compiler mojo seems to add dashes to all parameters entered here. The internal API used by this version of the plugin, however, needs parameters without dashes. So the plugin removes them again.\r\nAs the parameters here are not really command line ecj parameters it is hard to know which ones to use: look at the Compiler.java class and CompilerOptions.java classes inside Eclipse&#39;s source code for details.\r\n\r\n* The plugin DOES accept some parameters there, but these are interpreted by the plugin itself and then &quot;translated&quot; to the internal api.\r\n\r\nThis plugin accepts the following parameters in the &amp;lt;compilerArguments&gt;&amp;gt; tag:\r\n\r\n* &amp;lt;properties&amp;gt;filename&amp;lt;/properties&amp;gt;: defines a properties file that will be passed to the -properties parameter of the compiler. Examples of this file&#39;s format can be found by looking at the file .settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs in an Eclipse project: this file stores the compiler&#39;s configuration. It contains settings for warnings, errors and informational messages plus compiler compliance settings.\r\n\r\n* &amp;lt;errorsAsWarnings&amp;gt;whatever&amp;lt;/errorsAsWarnings&amp;gt;. When this is valid the plugin will ignore any error that is generated by the compiler and report them as warnings. Of course compilation still failed so depending on the error a .class file might have been written/updated or not. This gets handled by the plugin itself: it just changes all errors to warnings and tells the world that compilation worked.\r\n\r\nFrom 2.8.4\r\n==========\r\n\r\nVersion 2.8.4 of the plexus-compiler-eclipse plugin has been mostly rewritten. It now uses the public API of the ECJ compiler which more or less is the ECJ compiler itself. This for instance means that everything that ECJ can do (like annotations processing) the plugin can now do too, and parameters entered in the &lt;compilerArguments&gt; tag are now passed to the compiler, which means you should be able to use [ecj&#39;s help page](https://help.eclipse.org/oxygen/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftask-using_batch_compiler.htm) to find out interesting parameters to add.\r\n\r\nLike the previous version this version also requires you to remove the &#39;-&#39; from all parameter names; the dash is automagically added again before the parameter name is added to the ecj command line.\r\n\r\nThis version supports annotation processing as defined by Maven; by adding the required parts to the compilation blob you can have your annotation processors run. For example:\r\n\r\n    &lt;plugin&gt;\r\n        &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-compiler-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;version&gt;${maven-compiler-plugin.version}&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n            &lt;annotationProcessors&gt;\r\n                &lt;annotationProcessor&gt;db.annotationprocessing.EntityAnnotationProcessor&lt;/annotationProcessor&gt;\r\n            &lt;/annotationProcessors&gt;\r\n            &lt;annotationProcessorPaths&gt;\r\n                &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n                    &lt;groupId&gt;to.etc.domui&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;property-annotations-processor&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;version&gt;1.2-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;\r\n                &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;/annotationProcessorPaths&gt;\r\n        &lt;/configuration&gt;\r\n     \r\n        &lt;dependencies&gt;\r\n            &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n                &lt;groupId&gt;to.etc.domui&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n                &lt;artifactId&gt;property-annotations-processor&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                &lt;version&gt;1.2-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;\r\n            &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependencies&gt;\r\n    &lt;/plugin&gt;\r\n\r\nThis part may seem incomplete because there is no reference to the plexus-compiler-eclipse plugin at all, but remember that in Maven that configuration inherits: the parent POM in this case contained the part above, and this just adds a bit of configuration for this POM&#39;s project only.\r\n","title":"Using Eclipse Java Compiler (ecj) in maven builds","body":"<p>The Eclipse Java Compiler (ecj) has a lot of advantages over the standard javac compiler.

It is hard to get by a list but at least these are known:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Version    Eclipse Release      Compiler Version\n3.13.0     Oxygen Release       4.7\n3.13.50    Oxygen 1a            4.7.1a\n3.13.100   Oxygen R2            4.7.2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The version always starts with 3, the 13 is more or less the \"year\" of the release. So when 13 is Oxygen (2017, 4.7) 14 will probably be Photon (2018, 4.8).</p>\n\n<h1>Versions of the plexus-compiler-eclipse plugin: before 2.8.4</h1>\n\n<p>Versions before 2.8.4 of the plexus-compiler-plugin used an internal API to start the Eclipse compiler. This causes a lot of things not to work that well, as this internal API, for instance, does not interpret the usual command line parameters of the ecj compiler. This makes it quite hard to use, and some things are not supported. The following is a list of restrictions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Annotations processing is not implemented. Any configuration is silently ignored.</p></li>\n<li><p>Adding specific parameters by using the &lt;compilerArguments&gt; tag is hard as there are multiple problems with the implementation:</p></li>\n<li><p>The compiler mojo seems to add dashes to all parameters entered here. The internal API used by this version of the plugin, however, needs parameters without dashes. So the plugin removes them again.\nAs the parameters here are not really command line ecj parameters it is hard to know which ones to use: look at the Compiler.java class and CompilerOptions.java classes inside Eclipse's source code for details.</p></li>\n<li><p>The plugin DOES accept some parameters there, but these are interpreted by the plugin itself and then \"translated\" to the internal api.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This plugin accepts the following parameters in the &lt;compilerArguments>&gt; tag:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>&lt;properties&gt;filename&lt;/properties&gt;: defines a properties file that will be passed to the -properties parameter of the compiler. Examples of this file's format can be found by looking at the file .settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs in an Eclipse project: this file stores the compiler's configuration. It contains settings for warnings, errors and informational messages plus compiler compliance settings.</p></li>\n<li><p>&lt;errorsAsWarnings&gt;whatever&lt;/errorsAsWarnings&gt;. When this is valid the plugin will ignore any error that is generated by the compiler and report them as warnings. Of course compilation still failed so depending on the error a .class file might have been written/updated or not. This gets handled by the plugin itself: it just changes all errors to warnings and tells the world that compilation worked.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>From 2.8.4</h1>\n\n<p>Version 2.8.4 of the plexus-compiler-eclipse plugin has been mostly rewritten. It now uses the public API of the ECJ compiler which more or less is the ECJ compiler itself. This for instance means that everything that ECJ can do (like annotations processing) the plugin can now do too, and parameters entered in the  tag are now passed to the compiler, which means you should be able to use <a href=\"https://help.eclipse.org/oxygen/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftask-using_batch_compiler.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ecj's help page</a> to find out interesting parameters to add.</p>\n\n<p>Like the previous version this version also requires you to remove the '-' from all parameter names; the dash is automagically added again before the parameter name is added to the ecj command line.</p>\n\n<p>This version supports annotation processing as defined by Maven; by adding the required parts to the compilation blob you can have your annotation processors run. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;plugin&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-compiler-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;${maven-compiler-plugin.version}&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;configuration&gt;\n        &lt;annotationProcessors&gt;\n            &lt;annotationProcessor&gt;db.annotationprocessing.EntityAnnotationProcessor&lt;/annotationProcessor&gt;\n        &lt;/annotationProcessors&gt;\n        &lt;annotationProcessorPaths&gt;\n            &lt;dependency&gt;\n                &lt;groupId&gt;to.etc.domui&lt;/groupId&gt;\n                &lt;artifactId&gt;property-annotations-processor&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n                &lt;version&gt;1.2-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;\n            &lt;/dependency&gt;\n        &lt;/annotationProcessorPaths&gt;\n    &lt;/configuration&gt;\n\n    &lt;dependencies&gt;\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;to.etc.domui&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;property-annotations-processor&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;version&gt;1.2-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n    &lt;/dependencies&gt;\n&lt;/plugin&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This part may seem incomplete because there is no reference to the plexus-compiler-eclipse plugin at all, but remember that in Maven that configuration inherits: the parent POM in this case contained the part above, and this just adds a bit of configuration for this POM's project only.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":2090327,"reputation":8485,"user_id":1860309,"accept_rate":53,"display_name":"Boris Brodski"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":12253,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":18,"accepted_answer_id":49599478,"answer_count":2,"score":18,"last_activity_date":1652193843,"creation_date":1444981058,"question_id":33164976,"body_markdown":"Eclipse uses it&#39;s own compiler (ECJ) to compile Java code.

Your address as well as the &quot;activemq.notifications&quot; address have no queues.</p>\n<p>If you're unclear on how addresses and queues relate to each other you can read more in <a href=\"https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/address-model.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the documentation</a>.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":22398921,"reputation":9,"user_id":16609735,"display_name":"squidmonkey"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":572,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":72180384,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1652187834,"creation_date":1652125928,"question_id":72177519,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m having issues getting ActiveMQ Artemis to automatically delete a dynamic address when there it is no longer used.\r\n\r\nBelow is an excerpt from the `broker.xml`:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n         &lt;address-setting match=&quot;#&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;dead-letter-address&gt;DLQ&lt;/dead-letter-address&gt;\r\n            &lt;expiry-address&gt;&lt;/expiry-address&gt;\r\n            &lt;redelivery-delay&gt;0&lt;/redelivery-delay&gt;\r\n            &lt;expiry-delay&gt;10&lt;/expiry-delay&gt;\r\n            &lt;max-size-bytes&gt;-1&lt;/max-size-bytes&gt;\r\n            &lt;max-size-messages&gt;-1&lt;/max-size-messages&gt;\r\n            &lt;message-counter-history-day-limit&gt;10&lt;/message-counter-history-day-limit&gt;\r\n            &lt;address-full-policy&gt;PAGE&lt;/address-full-policy&gt;\r\n            &lt;auto-create-queues&gt;true&lt;/auto-create-queues&gt;\r\n            &lt;auto-create-addresses&gt;true&lt;/auto-create-addresses&gt;\r\n            &lt;auto-delete-queues&gt;true&lt;/auto-delete-queues&gt;\r\n            &lt;auto-delete-addresses&gt;true&lt;/auto-delete-addresses&gt;\r\n            &lt;auto-delete-created-queues&gt;true&lt;/auto-delete-created-queues&gt;\r\n            &lt;auto-delete-queues-message-count&gt;-1&lt;/auto-delete-queues-message-count&gt;\r\n         &lt;/address-setting&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBelow is the producer code that creates the topic:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    /////////////////////////////////////\r\n    //Constructor to establish connection\r\n    /////////////////////////////////////\r\n    \r\n    public ActiveMQ(String amq_url) throws JMSException, NamingException{\r\n        jndi_env = new Hashtable&lt;String, Object&gt;();\r\n        jndi_env.put(InitialContext.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, &quot;org.apache.activemq.artemis.jndi.ActiveMQInitialContextFactory&quot;);\r\n        jndi_env.put(InitialContext.PROVIDER_URL, amq_url);\r\n        ic = new InitialContext(jndi_env);\r\n        ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = (ConnectionFactory) ic.lookup(&quot;ConnectionFactory&quot;);\r\n        this.connection = (ActiveMQConnection) connectionFactory.createConnection();\r\n        session = connection.createSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    ///////////useTopic()///////////\r\n    //create/select topic\r\n    ////////////////////////////////    \r\n    public void useTopic(String topicName) throws JMSException, NamingException{\r\n        if (producer != null) producer.close();\r\n        this.topic = (Destination) ic.lookup(&quot;dynamicTopics/&quot;+topicName);\r\n        this.producer = session.createProducer(topic);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void closeConnection() throws JMSException{\r\n        if (producer != null) producer.close();\r\n        if (connection != null) connection.stop();\r\n        if (session != null) session.close();\r\n        if (connection != null) connection.close();\r\n    } \r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen the address is created in ActiveMQ Artemis it looks different than the other ones in the drop down list (e.g. TEST_SDCData vs ExpiryQueue).\r\n\r\n[![Addresses][1]][1]\r\n\r\nMy coworker and I are unable to figure out why this specific address will not delete based on the above without restarting the ActiveMQ Artemis server.

working in an example only, I just want two tables, one for iPhone entities, and other for Samsung entities.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that in the SubcategoryMobilePhone class, I have the following line, which is the one I think throws the exception:\r\n\r\n    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)\r\n        @JoinColumn(name = &quot;mobilePhone_id&quot;)\r\n        Set&lt;AProductPhone&gt; children = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\nAs **AProductPhone** is not an entity, but an abstract class, I think the problem is there. I cannot set this abstract class as an @Entity and a @MappedSuperclass at the same time, but I neither want to have a table called *AProductPhone*. I need this class so I can retrieve from the database the set of &quot;Mobile Phone types&quot; that are registered on the SubcategoryMobilePhone class, but as they can be from different concrete classes, I want to have an abstract one extending them so I can retrieve them properly.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve seen also that it is needed to specify in the persistence.xml file the entity classes, so here is my persistence.xml file:\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n    &lt;persistence version=&quot;2.1&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence&quot;\r\n                 xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\r\n                 xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence\r\n                 http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_1.xsd&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;persistence-unit name=&quot;com.xxx.tutorial.mysqlHibernates&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;class&gt;com.xxx.tutorial.Category&lt;/class&gt;\r\n            &lt;class&gt;com.xxx.tutorial.SubcategoryMobilePhone&lt;/class&gt;\r\n            &lt;class&gt;com.xxx.tutorial.SubcategoryWashingMachine&lt;/class&gt;\r\n            &lt;class&gt;com.xxx.tutorial.SubcategoryTools&lt;/class&gt;\r\n            &lt;class&gt;com.xxx.tutorial.iPhone&lt;/class&gt;\r\n            &lt;class&gt;com.xxx.tutorial.Samsung&lt;/class&gt;\r\n            &lt;class&gt;com.xxx.tutorial.Bosh&lt;/class&gt;\r\n            &lt;class&gt;com.xxx.tutorial.Philips&lt;/class&gt;\r\n            &lt;class&gt;com.xxx.tutorial.Hammer&lt;/class&gt;\r\n    \r\n            &lt;properties&gt;\r\n                &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.connection.driver_class&quot; value=&quot;com.mysql.jdbc.Driver&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.connection.url&quot; value=&quot;jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/nested_parent_child_hibernate_multiple_tables_example&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.connection.autocommit&quot; value=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.connection.username&quot; value=&quot;root&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.connection.password&quot; value=&quot;&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.dialect&quot; value=&quot;org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.connection.CharSet&quot; value=&quot;utf8&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.connection.characterEncoding&quot; value=&quot;utf8&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.connection.useUnicode&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.show_sql&quot; value=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto&quot; value=&quot;update&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;!-- use encache provider--&gt;\r\n                &lt;!--&lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.cache.region.factory_class&quot;--&gt;\r\n                &lt;!--value=&quot;org.hibernate.cache.ehcache.EhCacheRegionFactory&quot;/&gt;--&gt;\r\n                &lt;!--&lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.javax.cache.provider&quot; value=&quot;org.ehcache.jsr107.EhcacheCachingProvider&quot;/&gt;--&gt;\r\n                &lt;!--&amp;lt;!&amp;ndash;use second level cache&amp;ndash;&amp;gt;--&gt;\r\n                &lt;!--&lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;--&gt;\r\n                &lt;!--&amp;lt;!&amp;ndash;use 3rd level cache&amp;ndash;&amp;gt;--&gt;\r\n                &lt;!--&lt;property name=&quot;hibernate.cache.use_query_cache&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;--&gt;\r\n            &lt;/properties&gt;\r\n        &lt;/persistence-unit&gt;\r\n    &lt;/persistence&gt;\r\n\r\nWhat I have to do to be able to manage a hierarchy like that? what I am doing wrong here or what am I missing? I think I have identified the issue, but don&#39;t know how to solve it\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\nTo summarize and clarify what I&#39;m trying to do, I have the following classes hierarchy in my Java project (using Maven):\r\n\r\n    class Category\r\n    -- abstract class ASubcategory\r\n    class SubcategoryMobilePhone extends ASubcategory\r\n    class SubcategoryWashingMachine extends ASubcategory\r\n    class SubcategoryTools extends ASubcategory\r\n    -- abstract class AProductPhone\r\n    class iPhone extends AProductPhone\r\n    class Samsung extends AProductPhone\r\n    -- abstract class AProductWashingMachine\r\n    class Bosh extends AProductWashingMachine\r\n    class Philips extends AProductWashingMachine\r\n    -- abstract class AProductTools\r\n    class Hammer extends AProductTools\r\n\r\nAnd this is the structure I want to create in my MySQL database using Hibernate:\r\n\r\n    Category\r\n    -SubcategoryMobilePhone\r\n    ---iPhone\r\n    ---Samsung\r\n    -SubcategoryWashingMachine\r\n    ---Bosh\r\n    ---Philips\r\n    -SubcategoryTools\r\n    ---Hammer\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t want the abstract classes to be added as tables in the database.\r\n\r\nAll the tables have a list of children, and a reference to their parents through the FK. So, for example, the `SubcategoryMobilePhone` class have a `Set&lt;AProductPhone&gt; children` to store children that can be either *iPhones* or *Samsungs*, and a reference to its parent, which is `Category`. Same with the rest of entities. How can I do that without become crazy with the Hibernate annotations?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/aj0aZ.png","title":"Hibernates - Use of @OneToMany or @ManyToMany targeting an unmapped class exception","body":"<p>I've seen that this exception is quite common when working with Hibernate, but I see also that there are many different causes for it.</p>\n<p>After going through several threads and forums I am not able to fin the solution to my problem, so any advice or suggestion would be very appretiated.</p>\n<p>I am trying to implement a hierarchy in my database as follows:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aj0aZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aj0aZ.png\" alt=\"Structure of the database\" /></a></p>\n<p>I have 7 tables which relations are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One Category can have many subcategories registered</li>\n<li>One Subcategory can have many AProductXXX registered</li>\n<li>And the bottom tables (iPhone, Samsung, Bosh, Philips, Hammer) extends form their corresponding abstract class.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The error I am having is the following:</p>\n<pre><code>Exception in thread &quot;main&quot;

Please see the following example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval certificateFactory = CertificateFactory.getInstance(&quot;X509&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am trying to get an instance of the certificate factory in order to generate an X509Certificate from a file in my test resources folder.
