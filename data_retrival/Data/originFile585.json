I came up with the idea to use the ArrayList and iteration as part of the argument parameters, since that's much cleaner and easier to expand later, but I'm getting a weird error that I don't know exactly how to fix.</p>\n<p>Here's the 3 files I'm working with.</p>\n<pre><code>import java.util.*;\n\npublic class LifeSimulator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String P1Name = &quot;P1&quot;;\n        String P2Name = &quot;P2&quot;;\n        String P3Name = &quot;P3&quot;;\n        String P4Name = &quot;P4&quot;;\n        String P5Name = &quot;P5&quot;;\n        String P6Name = &quot;P6&quot;;\n        ArrayList&lt;Person&gt; pList = new ArrayList&lt;Person&gt;();\n\n        Person P1 = new Person(P1Name);\n        Person P2 = new Person(P2Name);\n        Person P3 = new Person(P3Name);\n        Person P4 = new Person(P4Name);\n        Person P5 = new Person(P5Name);\n        Person P6 = new Person(P6Name);\n\n        pList.add(P1);\n        pList.add(P2);\n        pList.add(P3);\n        pList.add(P4);\n        pList.add(P5);\n        pList.add(P6);\nfor(int s = 1; s &lt;= 3; s++){\n        System.out.println(&quot;Session 1, Section &quot; + s);\n        Collections.shuffle(pList);\n        for(int i = 0; i &lt; pList.size(); i++){\n            if (pList.get(i).alreadyActed == false){\n            pList.get(i).getEvent(pList.get(i), pList, i);\n        }\n    }\n\n        for(int i = 0; i &lt; pList.size(); i++){\n            if(pList.get(i).alive == false){\n                System.out.println(pList.get(i).getName() + &quot; - DEAD&quot;);\n                pList.remove(i);\n                i--;\n            }else{\n                pList.get(i).refresh();\n            }\n        }\n     }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>import java.util.*;\npublic class Person {\n    private int lives;\n    private String name;\n    public boolean alive;\n    public boolean alreadyActed;\n\n\n    public Person(String name){\n        this.name = name;\n        lives = 3;\n        alive = true;\n        alreadyActed = false;\n    }\n\n    public String getName(){return name;}\n    public int getLives(){return lives;}\n    \n    public void loseLife(){\n        lives -= 1;\n        if (lives == 0){\n            System.out.println(name + &quot; has lost their final life and is now dead!&quot;);\n            alive = false;}\n    }\n    public void refresh(){\n        alreadyActed = false;\n    }\n\n    public void getEvent(Person self, ArrayList list, int place){\n        Random rand = new Random();\n        int determiner = rand.nextInt(10);\n        switch(determiner){\n            case 1:\n            case 2:\n            case 3:\n            case 4:\n            case 5:\n            Events.fillerEvent(self);\n            break;\n            case 6:\n            case 7:\n            case 8:\n            if (place != list.size()-1){\n                Events.groupEvent(self, list.get(place+1));\n            }else{\n                Events.fillerEvent(self);\n            }\n            break;\n            case 9:\n            case 10:\n            Events.fatalEvent(self);\n            default:\n\n        }\n        alreadyActed = true;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>import java.util.Random;\npublic class Events {\n    static Random rand = new Random();\n    \n    public static void fillerEvent(Person p){\n    switch(rand.nextInt(2)){\n        case 0:\n        System.out.println(p.getName() + &quot; works.&quot;);\n        break;\n        case 1:\n        System.out.println(p.getName() + &quot; crafts.&quot;);\n        break;\n    }\n}\npublic static void groupEvent(Person p1, Person p2){\n    switch(rand.nextInt(2)){\n        case 0:\n        System.out.println(p1.getName() + &quot; helps &quot; + p2.getName() + &quot;.&quot;);\n        break;\n        case 1:\n        System.out.println(p1.getName() + &quot; chats with &quot; + p2.getName() + &quot;.&quot;);\n        break;\n    }\n}\npublic static void fatalEvent(Person p){\n    switch(rand.nextInt(2)){\n        case 0:\n        System.out.println(p.getName() + &quot; died.&quot;);\n        death(p);\n        break;\n        case 1:\n        System.out.println(p.getName() + &quot; died.&quot;);\n        death(p);\n    }\n}\npublic static void death(Person p){\n    p.loseLife();\n    if(p.alive){\n    System.out.println(p.getName() + &quot; has &quot; + p.getLives() + &quot; lives left.&quot;);\n    }\n}\n}\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Whenever I try to run the code, when it tries to call [Events.groupEvent(self, list.get(place+1))], it throws this error:</p>\n<pre><code>Exception has occurred: java.lang.Error\n&quot;java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem: \n    The method groupEvent(Person, Person) in the type Events is not applicable for the arguments (Person, Object)\n&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The ArrayList contains Person objects, at least in the main file, so I'm not sure why it's just treating them as generic Objects here.

I have no control over the client(s).</p>\n<p>I have a <code>Executors.newCachedThreadPool()</code> in my Controller and my endpoint looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>    @GetMapping(&quot;/mySSEStream&quot;)\n    public SseEmitter sseEmitter() {\n        SseEmitter emitter = new SseEmitter(-1L);\n        MyRunner streamingRunner = new MyRunner(emitter);\n        cachedThreadPool.execute(streamingRunner);\n        return emitter;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>MyRunner:</p>\n<pre><code>public class MyRunner implements Runnable {\n    private final SseEmitter sseEmitter;\n\n    public StreamingRunner(SseEmitter sseEmitter) {\n        this.sseEmitter = sseEmitter;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        try {\n            sendData();\n        } catch (IOException ioException) {\n            sseEmitter.completeWithError(ioException);\n        } finally {\n            try {\n                sseEmitter.complete();\n            } catch (IllegalStateException illegalStateException) {\n                log.debug(&quot;SSE Emitter already closed...&quot;);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>So the controller thread creates the SSE emitter, a second thread (named <code>http-nio-9998-exec-1</code>) accepts the request, returns a 200, and begins emitting data. Then I get a debug log saying that the Dispatcher Servlet is &quot;Exiting but response remains open for further handling&quot;. The client disconnect happens. Then the third thread (named <code>http-nio-9998-exec-2</code>) begins processing the broken pipe error. I get a message <code>WebAsyncManager - Async error, dispatch to /mySSEStream</code>. However, no matter how I try to catch the error, it bubbles up to Tomcat and responds with a 500 error. I see this in the debugger. Obviously the 500 doesn't arrive at the client, but our endpoint metrics are littered with 500 errors.</p>\n<p>I can't catch this error anywhere. I've tried using the <code>AsyncHandlerInterceptor</code> to no avail. That recommends using the <code>WebAsyncManager</code> to register a deferred result, but I couldn't get that working. I've tried @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler, but that thread talks directly to the Tomcat container. I've also tried Filter but that doesn't work for outbound messages, it only filters incoming from Tomcat.</p>\n<p>I'm sure I'm missing something here and any help is greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","scheduler"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3192259,"reputation":117599,"user_id":2696260,"display_name":"M.

For example, `&quot;\\u001b[31m&quot;` sets the font color to dark red.\r\n- The second (i.e. `&quot;\\u001B[0m&quot;`) resets the terminal back to the default colors.\r\n\r\nSee [How-to: Use ANSI colors in the terminal][1] for more details.\r\n\r\nThe changes in font color are rendered correctly when the output is sent to the console within Intellij IDEA, as shown in this screen shot:\r\n\r\n[![Intellij Console][2]][2]\r\n\r\nHowever, as you pointed out, the ANSI escape sequences are not recognized when running the same code from a **Command Prompt** window. Here&#39;s a screen shot:\r\n\r\n[![Windows console][3]][3]\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t think that your problem is anything to do with locales. Instead you are encountering a limitation of the **Command Prompt** window on Windows; it does not handle those ANSI escape sequences correctly.\r\n\r\nThat issue has supposedly been fixed with more recent versions of Windows 10, though apparently associated changes to the Windows Registry (which I did not implement) are required.

These Spring files are linked to legally in web.xml.</p>\n\n<p>When I try to run the project using the <em>Maven-Tomcat7-Plugin</em> (via the <code>mvn tomcat7:run-war</code> goal), my project launches successfully and I am able to view my web pages and see my REST controller in action without issue.</p>\n\n<p>However, when I try to run the project in Eclipse, using its <code>Run As Server</code> option, it never works and I have no idea why not. I keep getting an error dialog box titles <strong>Server Error</strong> and with the message <strong>The selection cannot be run on any server.</strong> I have already configured a <strong>Tomcat 7</strong> server runtime legally in Eclipse; I can use this runtime without any problem for my other Java projects. I have tried everything that Google, Stackoverflow and blogs suggest to get an Eclipse Maven Spring project working on an Eclipse server. I've tried to delete the Eclipse project, delete the Eclipse-workspace files and reimport the project (both as a Maven project and as a regular Java project), but to no avail. I've also tried enabling the Dynamic Web Module in the <em>Project Facets</em> and setting the web directory to <code>src/main/webapp</code>, but also to no avail.</p>\n\n<p>I'm baffled; I've worked with Tomcat servers in Eclipse many times before but it is just not working for this specific Spring project, <strong>even though</strong> it deploys just fine on Tomcat using Maven. Does anyone have any idea what might be going wrong? Have I forgotten a trouble-shooting step? Is there something wrong with my project setup that is conflicting with what Eclipse expects in a Web Server project? Thanks in advance.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","numeric","integer-promotion","type-promotion"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":11683,"reputation":1438179,"user_id":22656,"accept_rate":86,"display_name":"Jon Skeet"},"score":3,"creation_date":1678461989,"post_id":75697954,"comment_id":133542677,"body_markdown":"You&#39;ve basically got `int` and `long` the wrong way round, meaning you&#39;re not doing a fair comparison.

Why don&#39;t you use many-to-many relationships? Is it a design choice? Let me try to answer in different flavors.\r\n\r\nUsing many-to-many relationships\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen using the &#39;many-to-many&#39; relationships, you shouldn&#39;t create entity classes for join tables. In your example, the class *HouseOwner* shouldn&#39;t be coded. Your model contains two entities: *House* and *Owner*. The way they interact with each other is through a many-to-many relationship. Once you define this relationship in your mappings, the JPA engine will derive the join table automatically (you can use `@JoinTable` mapping if the defaults doesn&#39;t fit you). The code would look like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Entity\r\n@Table(name = &quot;house&quot;)\r\npublic class House {\r\n\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\r\n    private long id;\r\n\r\n    @ManyToMany\r\n    @JoinTable(name = &quot;house_owner&quot;, joinColumns = {\r\n        @JoinColumn(name = &quot;house_id&quot;)},\r\n            inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = &quot;owner_id&quot;))\r\n    private Set&lt;Owner&gt; owners;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Entity\r\n@Table(name = &quot;owner&quot;)\r\npublic class Owner {\r\n\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\r\n    private long id;\r\n\r\n    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = &quot;owners&quot;) /* you must elect a relationship owner */\r\n    private Set&lt;House&gt; houses;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that&#39;s all you need to define your entities and their relationships. You can see the JPA is expecting the existence of a third table by enabling the `jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.action` property in your `persistence.xml`. Sniffing the created script, you would see something like this:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ncreate table house (id bigint generated by default as identity, primary key (id));\r\ncreate table house_owner (house_id bigint not null, owner_id bigint not null, primary key (house_id, owner_id));\r\ncreate table owner (id bigint generated by default as identity, primary key (id));\r\nalter table if exists house_owner add constraint FK96rb7vss0wg6qgwkbfmt4iw9w foreign key (owner_id) references owner;\r\nalter table if exists house_owner add constraint FKcb77jw3le78e333bx246ln3ap foreign key (house_id) references house;\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing one-to-many relationships\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nOne issue with the previous approach, as you mentioned in your comment, is that it isn&#39;t possible to map the `LocalDateTime createdAt` field in the **house_owner** join table. One way around this problem is to use one-to-many mappings on `House` and `Owner` entities. The code would look like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Entity\r\n@Table(name = &quot;house&quot;)\r\npublic class House {\r\n\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\r\n    private long id;\r\n\r\n    @OneToMany(mappedBy = &quot;house&quot;)\r\n    private Set&lt;HouseOwner&gt; owners;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Entity\r\n@Table(name = &quot;owner&quot;)\r\npublic class Owner {\r\n\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\r\n    private long id;\r\n\r\n    @OneToMany(mappedBy = &quot;owner&quot;)\r\n    private Set&lt;HouseOwner&gt; houses;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Entity\r\n@Table(name = &quot;house_owner&quot;)\r\npublic public class HouseOwner {\r\n\r\n    @Id\r\n    @ManyToOne\r\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;house_id&quot;)\r\n    private House house;\r\n\r\n    @Id\r\n    @ManyToOne\r\n    @JoinColumn(name = &quot;owner_id&quot;)\r\n    private Owner owner;\r\n\r\n    private LocalDateTime createdAt;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, enabling the `jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.scripts.action` property and looking at the generated script, you&#39;ll see:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate table house (id bigint generated by default as identity, primary key (id));\r\ncreate table house_owner (createdAt timestamp(6), house_id bigint not null, owner_id bigint not null, primary key (house_id, owner_id));\r\ncreate table owner (id bigint generated by default as identity, primary key (id));\r\nalter table if exists house_owner add constraint FKcb77jw3le78e333bx246ln3ap foreign key (house_id) references house;\r\nalter table if exists house_owner add constraint FK96rb7vss0wg6qgwkbfmt4iw9w foreign key (owner_id) references owner;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s pretty much the same output as the previous example! But, this way, you have more control over the *house_owner* table.\r\n\r\nUsing transient annotations\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nIf yet you want to use `@Transient` in your modeling, I can only imagine that you don&#39;t want the JPA engine doing the hard work for you.
