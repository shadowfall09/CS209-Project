These methods, too, can be a bit tricky to write properly.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":16765025,"reputation":1192,"user_id":12118888,"display_name":"Payel Senapati"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":78,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":72379947,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1673459375,"creation_date":1653490183,"question_id":72379854,"body_markdown":"I have the follwing Person Class - \r\n\r\n`Person.java` -\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Person implements Comparable&lt;Person&gt; {\r\n    private int id;\r\n    private String name;\r\n\r\n    Person(int id, String name) {\r\n        this.id = id;\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public int getId() {\r\n        return id;\r\n    }\r\n    public String getName() {\r\n        return name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public String toString() {\r\n        return &quot;Person: Id = &quot; + id + &quot;, Name = &quot; + name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int compareTo(Person person) {\r\n        int myReturn = 0;\r\n        int minLength = 0;\r\n        int i = 0;\r\n        boolean equal = false;\r\n        if (id &gt; person.id) {\r\n            myReturn = 1;\r\n        } else if (id &lt; person.id) {\r\n            myReturn = -1;\r\n        } else {\r\n            if (name.length() &gt; person.name.length()) {\r\n                minLength = person.name.length();\r\n            } else if (name.length() &lt; person.name.length()) {\r\n                minLength = name.length();\r\n            } else {\r\n                equal = true;\r\n                minLength = name.length();\r\n            }\r\n            for (i = 0; i &lt; minLength; i++) {\r\n                if (name.charAt(i) &gt; person.name.charAt(i))  {\r\n                    myReturn = 1;\r\n                    break;\r\n                } else if (name.charAt(i) &lt; person.name.charAt(i)) {\r\n                    myReturn = -1;\r\n                    break;\r\n                } else {\r\n                    continue;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            if (i == minLength) {\r\n                if (equal) {\r\n                    myReturn = 0;\r\n                } else if (name.length() &gt; person.name.length()) {\r\n                    myReturn = 1;\r\n                } else {\r\n                    myReturn = -1;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return myReturn;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n \r\nNow, I have the following TreeClass instance - \r\n\r\n```\r\nTreeSet&lt;Person&gt; treeSet = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;(List.of(\r\n                new Person(4, &quot;Amrita&quot;),\r\n                new Person(4, &quot;Amrita&quot;),\r\n                new Person(9, &quot;Sunita&quot;),\r\n                new Person(12, &quot;Nisha&quot;),\r\n                new Person(9, &quot;Sunit&quot;),\r\n                new Person(9, &quot;Sunitaa&quot;)\r\n        ));\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpon printing - \r\n\r\n```\r\nPerson: Id = 4, Name = Amrita\r\nPerson: Id = 9, Name = Sunit\r\nPerson: Id = 9, Name = Sunita\r\nPerson: Id = 9, Name = Sunitaa\r\nPerson: Id = 12, Name = Nisha\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo clearly, the two Person instances -  `new Person(4, &quot;Amrita&quot;)` and `new Person(4, &quot;Amrita&quot;)` are equal. \r\n\r\nNow, I have the following Queue code.

For subject 4, they should have an index date like:</p>\n<div class=\"s-table-container\">\n<table class=\"s-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>SUBJECT</th>\n<th>EVENT_DATE</th>\n<th>INDEX_DATE</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2020-05-01</td>\n<td>2022-05-01</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2021-05-25</td>\n<td>2022-05-25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2021-05-31</td>\n<td>2022-05-25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2022-11-31</td>\n<td>2022-11-31</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2022-12-02</td>\n<td>2022-11-31</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},{"tags":["javascript","java","angularjs","frontend","seedstack"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":27116056,"reputation":71,"user_id":20660373,"display_name":"Nyctfall"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1673452493,"creation_date":1673452493,"answer_id":75085764,"question_id":75085083,"body_markdown":"Hi Hugo Orlando Gonzalez!\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not very familiar with the `W20` library or `SeedStack`, so I&#39;m going off of my experience using other authentication schemes, so I may be rather abstract. \r\n\r\nAccording to:\r\n\r\n- [HTTP Authorization Hearer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization),\r\n- [HTML form element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form),\r\n- [Sending form data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data),\r\n- [W20 Docs: forms](https://w20-framework.github.io/addons/components/forms/)\r\n- [ReST API SeedStack](http://seedstack.org/docs/web/rest/)\r\n\r\nYou would have to setup `data-ng-submit=&quot;form.submit()&quot;` to call:\r\n\r\n```lang-js\r\n$scope.form = {\r\n  model: { /* ... */ },\r\n  fields: [{ /* the form login fields... */ }],\r\n  submit: function () {\r\n    // send form (XHR, AJAX, fetch, etc.) request to back-end\r\n    // get token for  Authorization  header or get cookie for server session\r\n    // save to LocalStorge or in a cookie, whichever is used on your back-end\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then save the token in\r\n[`LocalStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage),\r\nor in a\r\n[`cookie`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie)\r\nthat&#39;s then checked for authentication on the server.\r\n\r\nI hope it helps.","title":"Replace &quot;Basic Authentication&quot; with &quot;Form Authentication&quot;","body":"<p>Hi Hugo Orlando Gonzalez!</p>\n<p>I'm not very familiar with the <code>W20</code> library or <code>SeedStack</code>, so I'm going off of my experience using other authentication schemes, so I may be rather abstract.</p>\n<p>According to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HTTP Authorization Hearer</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HTML form element</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sending form data</a>,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://w20-framework.github.io/addons/components/forms/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">W20 Docs: forms</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://seedstack.org/docs/web/rest/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ReST API SeedStack</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You would have to setup <code>data-ng-submit=&quot;form.submit()&quot;</code> to call:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>$scope.form = {\n  model: { /* ... */ },\n  fields: [{ /* the form login fields... */ }],\n  submit: function () {\n    // send form (XHR, AJAX, fetch, etc.) request to back-end\n    // get token for  Authorization  header or get cookie for server session\n    // save to LocalStorge or in a cookie, whichever is used on your back-end\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And then save the token in\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>LocalStorage</code></a>,\nor in a\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><code>cookie</code></a>\nthat's then checked for authentication on the server.</p>\n<p>I hope it helps.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":21879696,"reputation":1,"user_id":16168220,"display_name":"Hugo Orlando Gonzalez"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":97,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1673452493,"creation_date":1673449516,"question_id":75085083,"body_markdown":"Is there a way to replace &quot;Basic Authentication&quot; with &quot;Form Authentication&quot; in W20?.

I wouldn't really want to save the image on disk any way, but for now it's okay i guess.</p>\n<p>Basically, how it should work as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>User visits a web page (Angular)</li>\n<li>The web player loads with a live stream url to the spring boot backend</li>\n<li>The spring boot backend connect further to the CCTV server via TCP (not possible via RTSP or other protocol) and sends the <code>live</code> command via the socket</li>\n<li>Within the same socket session the server starts pushing the live stream bytes</li>\n<li>The spring boot app takes these bytes and sends them further to the browser.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any suggestions?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","netty","rtsp","rtp"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":22823318,"reputation":1,"user_id":16972915,"display_name":"DatTran"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1673452070,"creation_date":1673402713,"answer_id":75077643,"question_id":35749293,"body_markdown":"I&#39;m having the same problem as you were (years later), after a decent amount of time I&#39;ve noticed that you only need a single ChannelPipeline to handle RTSP and RTP packet.

This gives O(1) insertion and O(1) removal with extremely low overhead.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":1569101,"reputation":3689,"user_id":1457219,"accept_rate":86,"display_name":"Jeremy"},"comment_count":13,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":818,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":16431985,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1673444726,"creation_date":1367981744,"question_id":16431931,"body_markdown":"Currently, I have a LinkedList which stores a custom Node class.
