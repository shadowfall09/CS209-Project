Instead you only close the <code>ByteArrayOutputStream</code> (which is a no-op). That means that if the stream implementation does internal caching/buffering, it will never be flushed to the underlying stream. In my very limited testing, I could reproduce the problem and this does indeed seem to be the case.</p>\n<p>A safer and more idiomatic Java 7+ version of the code would create the wrapped steam using try-with-resources, and fix the problem (by automatically invoking <code>close()</code>):</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public static ByteArrayOutputStream mergeIntoSingle(List&lt;String&gt; imagePaths) {\n    ImageWriter imageWriter = ImageIO.getImageWritersByFormatName(&quot;tiff&quot;).next();\n    ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\n\n    try (ImageOutputStream outputStream = ImageIO.createImageOutputStream(byteArrayOutputStream)) {\n        imageWriter.setOutput(outputStream);\n        imageWriter.prepareWriteSequence(null);\n\n        for (String path : imagePaths) {\n            BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(new FileInputStream(path));\n            ImageWriteParam writeParams = imageWriter.getDefaultWriteParam();\n            IIOMetadata metadata = imageWriter.getDefaultImageMetadata(new ImageTypeSpecifier(image),\n                                                                       writeParams);\n\n            IIOImage iioImage = new IIOImage(image, null, metadata);\n            imageWriter.writeToSequence(iioImage, null);\n        }\n        imageWriter.endWriteSequence();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        System.out.println(e.getLocalizedMessage());\n    }\n    return byteArrayOutputStream;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>PS: I think the <code>TIFFImageWriter</code> <em>should</em> have invoked <code>flush()</code> on the stream in the <code>endWriteSequence()</code> method (that's what TwelveMonkeys library does). However, you should always make sure you close any stream you open, so the above code is better in any case.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":2824501,"reputation":449,"user_id":2427414,"accept_rate":0,"display_name":"Zamir"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":201,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1653398879,"creation_date":1653395698,"question_id":72362975,"body_markdown":"My primary intention is to merge multiple different tiff image files into one single file.

all!**&lt;br/&gt;\r\nI&#39;m trying to set up an automation project using Cucumber &amp; Appium for Mobile apps (iOS and Android both).&lt;br/&gt;\r\nI plan to write the project in JAVA and I use Gradle for implementing the desired dependencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\r\nSo I wrote a small project and for some reason it keeps failing with the following error:&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\r\n    java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError\r\nThe exception occurs when I&#39;m calling `PageFactory.initElements(new AppiumFieldDecorator(driver), this);`&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\r\nThis is how I implemented the page object class:&lt;br/&gt;\r\n```\r\npublic class OnboardingPageObjects {\r\n\r\n    public OnboardingPageObjects(AppiumDriver driver) {\r\n        PageFactory.initElements(new AppiumFieldDecorator(driver), this);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @AndroidFindBy(id = &quot;com.bupp.wood_spoon_chef.staging:id/orangeBtnBackground&quot;)\r\n    public WebElement getStartedButton;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is the tests class where it fails within the `@Before` hook:\r\n```\r\npublic class FeedSteps {\r\n\r\n    public Capabilities cap;\r\n    public

initialize the `AppiumDriver` (currently only AndroidDriver, iOS driver is not in use):\r\n```\r\npublic class Capabilities {\r\n\r\n    private AppiumDriver driver = null;\r\n    public DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();\r\n\r\n    public void preparation(String port, Platform platform) throws MalformedURLException {\r\n        if (platform == Platform.IOS)

           capabilities.setCapability(IOSMobileCapabilityType.BUNDLE_ID, &quot;&quot;);\r\n            capabilities.setCapability(&quot;instrumentedApp&quot;, true);\r\n            driver = new

The `new AppiumFieldDecorator(driver)` and instead doing this:`PageFactory.initElements(driver, this);`\r\n 2.

using Cucumber &amp; Appium for Mobile apps (iOS and Android both).<br/>\nI plan to write the project in JAVA and I use Gradle for implementing the desired dependencies.<br/><br/>\nSo I wrote a small project and for some reason it keeps failing with the following error:<br/></p>\n<pre><code>java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError\n</code></pre>\n<p>The exception occurs when I'm calling <code>PageFactory.initElements(new AppiumFieldDecorator(driver), this);</code><br/><br/>\nThis is how I implemented the page object class:<br/></p>\n<pre><code>public class OnboardingPageObjects {\n\n    public OnboardingPageObjects(AppiumDriver driver) {\n        PageFactory.initElements(new AppiumFieldDecorator(driver), this);\n    }\n\n    @AndroidFindBy(id =

OnboardingPageObjects(cap.getDriver());\n    }\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is the class where I initialize the <code>AppiumDriver</code> (currently only AndroidDriver, iOS driver is not in use):</p>\n<pre><code>public class Capabilities {\n\n    private AppiumDriver driver = null;\n    public DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();\n\n    public void

Each record has an id and a status. I need to query for each record based on its status, process it, and finally update the status.</p>\n<p>I am using <code>DynamoDbEnhancedClient</code> but I could not find example on how to query based only on the range and not the hash, while avoiding scan.\nI tried to create a query with a condition and a limit of 1 but it did not work.</p>\n<p>Here is what I have:</p>\n<p>My Customer model:</p>\n<pre><code>@DynamoDbPartitionKey\nprivate String id;\n@DynamoDbSecondarySortKey(indexNames = &quot;status&quot;)\nprivate String status;\nprivate String name;\n</code></pre>\n<p>configs:</p>\n<pre><code>@Bean\npublic DynamoDbEnhancedClient dynamoDbEnhancedClient(){\n    return DynamoDbEnhancedClient.builder()\n            .dynamoDbClient(dynamoDbClient())\n            .extensions(AutoGeneratedTimestampRecordExtension.create())\n            .build();\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>My query:</p>\n<pre><code>static final TableSchema&lt;Customer&gt; CUSTOMER_TABLE = TableSchema.fromClass(Customer.class);\n\npublic Customer findByStatus() {\n    DynamoDbTable&lt;Customer&gt; customerTable = dynamoDbEnhancedClient.table(&quot;customer&quot;, CUSTOMER_TABLE);\n\n    QueryConditional queryConditionalPerPartition = new EqualToConditional(Key.builder().\n            partitionValue(&quot;status&quot;).\n            build());\n\n\n    QueryEnhancedRequest request = QueryEnhancedRequest.builder()\n            .limit(1)\n            .queryConditional(queryConditionalPerPartition)\n            .build();\n\n\n    PageIterable&lt;Customer&gt; pageIterable = customerTable.query(request);\n\n\n    Customer customer = pageIterable.stream().findFirst().get().items().get(0);\n    return customer;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>However that does not work. How can query by status and only get a single result?\nI have no restriction on the table structure and I can change it however I require.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","sorting","arraylist"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":279365,"reputation":49126,"user_id":574479,"accept_rate":87,"display_name":"biziclop"},"score":1,"creation_date":1409575872,"post_id":25606267,"comment_id":40000187,"body_markdown":"Convert the strings to actual dates and sort them as dates.","body":"Convert the strings to actual dates and sort them as dates."},{"owner":{"account_id":4113645,"reputation":1892,"user_id":3375858,"accept_rate":82,"display_name":"flotothemoon"},"score":1,"creation_date":1409575926,"post_id":25606267,"comment_id":40000220,"body_markdown":"Make `Person` implement `Comparable` and convert the string dates to actual dates and compare them in the `compareTo` method, you can then sort it using `Arrays.sort`","body":"Make <code>Person</code> implement <code>Comparable</code> and convert the string dates to actual dates and compare them in the <code>compareTo</code> method, you can then sort it using <code>Arrays.sort</code>"},{"owner":{"account_id":3387717,"reputation":365,"user_id":2843340,"accept_rate":29,"display_name":"TryingToLearn"},"score":0,"creation_date":1409576024,"post_id":25606267,"comment_id":40000273,"body_markdown":"Any code sample would help.","body":"Any code sample would help."},{"owner":{"account_id":23121,"reputation":527346,"user_id":57695,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"Peter Lawrey"},"score":0,"creation_date":1409576212,"post_id":25606267,"comment_id":40000391,"body_markdown":"@lear I suggest you do a quick search for how to convert a string to a date and how to compare dates.
