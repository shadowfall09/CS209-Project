In your example it makes no difference, but it would, if you decided to add Components after the method call.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":15708211,"reputation":1,"user_id":11334371,"display_name":"Samad Soleimani"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1659522987,"creation_date":1659457249,"answer_id":73210724,"question_id":73210356,"body_markdown":"**in you first code :**\r\n\r\nyou must add this 2 line after declaration tittle :\r\n\r\n        tittle.setHorizontalAlignment(SwingConstants.CENTER);\r\n        tittle.setVerticalAlignment(SwingConstants.TOP);\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n**in update version**\r\n\r\nIt depends on how you want to use this class.\r\nOne way to use it can be like this :\r\n\r\n        GuiInterface gi = new GuiInterface();\r\n        gi.GUI();\r\n\r\nand result is :\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/JRxoP.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/djMPn.jpg","title":"Java Gui label does not show up in the desired location on screen","body":"<p><strong>in you first code :</strong></p>\n<p>you must add this 2 line after declaration tittle :</p>\n<pre><code>    tittle.setHorizontalAlignment(SwingConstants.CENTER);\n    tittle.setVerticalAlignment(SwingConstants.TOP);\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JRxoP.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JRxoP.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>in update version</strong></p>\n<p>It depends on how you want to use this class.\nOne way to use it can be like this :</p>\n<pre><code>    GuiInterface gi = new GuiInterface();\n    gi.GUI();\n</code></pre>\n<p>and result is :</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/djMPn.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/djMPn.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":25959235,"reputation":11,"user_id":19676116,"display_name":"jhg"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":99,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1659522987,"creation_date":1659455293,"question_id":73210356,"body_markdown":"I have created a small GUI in Java Swing but I am facing a tiny issue with the location of the label. \r\nI need to show the label at the top center of the frame but in my code even if I add set bounds, it still shows up in the wrong place.

If you are using the full name like this in other places, then even more reason to make a class.\r\n\r\nIn Java 16 and later, you might choose to use the new [record][1] feature to more briefly define the class.

In the more general case, the OP&#39;s task could be met by a [LookupOp][4], which requires building lookup arrays. To modify only the alpha channel, supply an identity array (an array where table[i] = i) for the RGB channels, and a separate array for the alpha channel. Populate the latter array with `table[i] = f(i)`, where `f()` is the function by which you want to map from old alpha value to new. E.g. if you want to &quot;make every pixel in the image that has a alpha value of 100 have a alpha value of 80&quot;, set `table[100] = 80`. (The full range is 0 to 255.) See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10088237/how-to-increase-opacity-in-gaussian-blur for a code sample.\r\n\r\n### RescaleOp ###\r\n\r\nBut for a subset of these cases, there is a simpler way to do it, that doesn&#39;t require setting up a lookup table. If `f()` is a simple, linear function, use a [RescaleOp][6]. For example, if you want to set `newAlpha = oldAlpha - 20`, use a RescaleOp with a scaleFactor of 1 and an offset of -20. If you want to set `newAlpha = oldAlpha * 0.8`, use a scaleFactor of 0.8 and an offset of 0. In either case, you again have to provide dummy scaleFactors and offsets for the RGB channels:\r\n\r\n    new RescaleOp({1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, /* alpha scaleFactor */ 0.8f},\r\n                  {0f, 0f, 0f, /* alpha offset */ -20f}, null)\r\n\r\nAgain see [4.10.6 here][5] for some examples that illustrate the principles well, but are not specific to the alpha channel.\r\n\r\nBoth [RescaleOp][6] and [LookupOp][4] allow modifying a BufferedImage in-place.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/VmUtr.png\r\n  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing\r\n  [3]: http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/java-ent/jfc/ch04_10.htm\r\n  [4]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/image/LookupOp.html\r\n  [5]: http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/java-ent/jfc/ch04_10.htm\r\n  [6]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/image/RescaleOp.html","title":"Change the alpha value of a BufferedImage?","body":"<p>This is an old question, so I'm not answering for the sake of the OP, but for those like me who find this question later.</p>\n\n<h2>AlphaComposite</h2>\n\n<p>As @Michael's excellent outline mentioned, an AlphaComposite operation can modify the alpha channel.

Activiti uses *&quot;Optimistic Locking&quot;* for records for performance purposes.\r\n\r\nNow if your process branches complete relatively close to each other in time, then it is possible (actually highly likely) you WILL receive an `Optimistic Locking Exception` on the DB update, like this:\r\n\r\n&gt;`09:59:52,432 [flowable-async-job-executor-thread-2] ERROR org.flowable.job.service.impl.asyncexecutor.DefaultAsyncRunnableExecutionExceptionHandler  - Job 12575 failed\r\norg.flowable.engine.common.api.FlowableOptimisticLockingException: ProcessInstance[12567] was updated by another transaction concurrently`\r\n\r\n*(Note: The error above is not actually from Activiti but instead from a project called &quot;[Flowable][1]&quot;.

I don't need to max perfs, i'm quite new at Spring batch and i'm wondering how to design the processing :)<br/>\nThanks !!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>EDIT : I cannot use a simple list because the list is not at root level but in a &quot;data&quot; property at root level. Also by &quot;Query each <code>HREF</code>&quot; I meant perform an API call using the HREF value which is a link to the endpoint of a single item data that I must query because i need data from it not present in the 1st list given by the API.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>EDIT 2 : See comments on accepted answer for solution.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","jpa","entity"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3430916,"reputation":3799,"user_id":3059385,"accept_rate":40,"display_name":"Christopher Schneider"},"score":1,"creation_date":1659460393,"post_id":73211231,"comment_id":129298524,"body_markdown":"Unclear what you&#39;re asking.

Does OAuth client gets invoked before REST endpoint, say in some security filter chain which takes care of exchanging authorization code with access token and then forwards it to the REST endpoint?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/PfBZS.png","title":"How OAuth resource server receives access token?","body":"<p>I have a main class:</p>\n<pre><code>@SpringBootApplication\npublic class Oauth2Exp {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SpringApplication.run(OauthDemo.class, args);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>and a simple REST end point (retrieves access token and outputs it along with string &quot;Hello world!!&quot;):</p>\n<pre><code>@RestController\n@RequestMapping(&quot;/api&quot;)\npublic class SampleRest {\n    \n    @Autowired\n    private OAuth2AuthorizedClientService authorizedClientService;\n    \n    @GetMapping(&quot;/helloworld&quot;)\n    public String helloworld(Authentication authentication) {\n        OAuth2AuthorizedClient authorizedClient =\n                this.authorizedClientService.loadAuthorizedClient(&quot;google&quot;, authentication.getName());\n\n        OAuth2AccessToken accessToken = authorizedClient.getAccessToken();\n        \n        return &quot;Hello world!!\\n&quot; + accessToken.getTokenValue();     \n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then I have following configuration for configuring this app as OAuth client:</p>\n<pre><code>@Configuration\npublic class OauthClientConfig {\n    \n    @Bean\n    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception\n    {\n        http.requestMatchers().antMatchers(&quot;/**&quot;)\n            .and()\n            .authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated()\n            .and()\n            .oauth2Login();\n            \n        return http.build();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>and following configuration to configure same app as OAuth resource server:</p>\n<pre><code>@Configuration\npublic class OauthResourceServerConfig {\n\n    @Bean\n    public SecurityFilterChain resourceServerfilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception\n    {\n        http.requestMatchers().antMatchers(&quot;/api/**&quot;)\n            .and()\n            .authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated()\n            .and()\n            .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();\n        \n        return http.build();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>application.yml looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>spring:\n  security:\n    oauth2:\n      client:\n        registration:\n          google:\n            clientId: &lt;client-id&gt;\n            clientSecret: &lt;client-secret&gt;\n      resourceserver:\n        jwt:\n          issuer-uri: https://accounts.google.com\n</code></pre>\n<p>Also I have necessary dependencies for oauth-client and resource server in pom.xml.

When I hit the URL <code>localhost:8080/api/helloworld</code>, I am <strong>directly hitting</strong> <code>helloworld()</code> REST endpoint of the <strong>resource server</strong>. Then how it receives access token?

In short: I have bad `cas.authn.spnego.jcifsServicePrincipal` in `cas.properties`.\r\n\r\n**Details:**\r\n\r\n - Active Directory \r\n - JDK 1.8 + JCE\r\n - Apereo CAS 5.1 \r\n - Tomcat 8.5.15 on Windows Server 2012 R2\r\n\r\nCAS [documentation][1] suggest such configuration:\r\n\r\n    cas.authn.spnego.jcifsServicePrincipal=HTTP/cas.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM\r\n\r\nBut be aware, that `jcifsServicePrincipal` is *principal* name - the name of the Active Directory **user**, which has SPN assigned.\r\nI have user `cn=service_xxx` which has `servicePrincipalName` attribute assigned to `HTTP/machine1.domain.com` and `HTTP/machine1` (but I think, that only first is needed).\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s worth to follow this tutorial: [Kerberos / SPNEGO based SSO (Single Sign-On) in Weblogic][2].\r\n\r\n**How does my CAS works:**\r\n\r\nUsing above tutorial, I create SPN for the existing user *service_xxx* (user which may log into *machine1*):\r\n\r\n    setspn -s HTTP/machine1.domain.com  service_xxx\r\n\r\nUser *service_xxx* has such properties in Active Directory: AES 128 bit encryption and AES 256 bit encryption.\r\n\r\nBoth operations were done by Active Directory administrator (he has sufficient privileges).\r\n\r\nSo `service_xxx` is principal name (user name) and `HTTP/machine1.domain.com` is only SPN attribute assigned to the principal. As far as I understood - now CAS server running on machine `machine1.domain.com` (this is machine URL) can obtain any information from AD (LDAP) by user `service_xxx`. So CAS server can also authenticate any user using Kerberos protocol. In my opinion, this is why the CAS property `jcifsServicePrincipal` should point to principal `service_xxx@domain.com` (full principal name with @domain.com) and not to its SPN attribute name (unless they are equal strings).\r\n\r\n**My configuration details:**\r\n\r\n 1. Principal with AES attributes and SPN attribute set\r\n 2. Java with *Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength* installed\r\n 3. Keytab created using `ktab.exe` tool from JDK \r\n 4. `login.conf` file - the same as in [CAS documentation][3]\r\n 5. `cas.properties` and `krb5.conf` as shown below\r\n\r\n**Keytab**\r\n\r\nKey tab creation procedure (no any special privileges require):\r\n\r\n    &quot;C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre1.8.0_131\\bin\\ktab.exe&quot; -a service_xxx -n 0 -k cas.keytab\r\n\r\n`-k` specifies key tab output file name. `-n 0` specifies KNVO number. Disclaimer: for my user cn=service_xxx in Active Directory there is no attribute `msDS-KeyVersionNumber` (KNVO), so I used 0. But I think that Windows ignores the KNVO number - see [this comment][4].\r\n\r\nOne more information about **keytab**:\r\n\r\nA lot of tutorials and even official [documentation][3] suggest to make keytab using `ktpass.exe`. Unfortunately this requires AD admin privilege, so this is not a good idea. Better use `ktab.exe` from JDK (as above). You only need to remember always generating new keytab after `service_xxx` password change.\r\n\r\nTo test key tab there several options:\r\n\r\n - use kinit to gather kerberos ticket (for service_xxx principal). This is also tool supplied by JDK.\r\n - Try this small app written by @Ivan Veselovsky from SO: https://stackoverflow.com/a/13859217/5162026\r\n\r\n**`cas.properties` which works for me:**\r\n\r\n\tcas.authn.spnego.kerberosConf=/etc/cas/config/krb5.conf\r\n\tcas.authn.spnego.jcifsServicePrincipal=service_xxx@domain.com\r\n\tcas.authn.spnego.loginConf=file:/etc/cas/config/login.conf\r\n\tcas.authn.spnego.kerberosRealm=DOMAIN.COM\r\n\r\n\tcas.authn.spnego.principal.principalAttribute=sAMAccountName\r\n\r\n\tcas.authn.spnego.ldap.ldapUrl=ldap://path.to.ldap.domain.com \r\n\tcas.authn.spnego.ldap.baseDn=DC=domain,DC=com #this is base dn where LDAP starts searching for users\r\n\tcas.authn.spnego.ldap.bindDn=cn=SERVICE_XXX,DC=domain,DC=com #it&#39;s a kind of login to LDAP\r\n\tcas.authn.spnego.ldap.failFast=false\r\n\tcas.authn.spnego.ldap.subtreeSearch=true\r\n\tcas.authn.spnego.ldap.useSsl=false\r\n\tcas.authn.spnego.ldap.searchFilter=cn={host}\r\n\r\nIt is funny that paths like `/etc/cas/config` works also on Windows and points to `C:` drive root - so `C:\\etc\\cas\\config`. Be aware, that all config here (and at all Java files) paths are using forward slash. \r\n\r\nI also supply krb5.conf. This file is specific to your organization. Often you can find it somewhere inside `C:\\Windows` folder in any workstation connected to domain. So you can copy it, and edit as you want.

In short: I have bad <code>cas.authn.spnego.jcifsServicePrincipal</code> in <code>cas.properties</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Active Directory </li>\n<li>JDK 1.8 + JCE</li>\n<li>Apereo CAS 5.1 </li>\n<li>Tomcat 8.5.15 on Windows Server 2012 R2</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>CAS <a href=\"https://apereo.github.io/cas/5.1.x/installation/Configuration-Properties.html#spnego-authentication\" rel=\"noreferrer\">documentation</a> suggest such configuration:</p>\n\n<pre><code>cas.authn.spnego.jcifsServicePrincipal=HTTP/cas.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But be aware, that <code>jcifsServicePrincipal</code> is <em>principal</em> name - the name of the Active Directory <strong>user</strong>, which has SPN assigned.\nI have user <code>cn=service_xxx</code> which has <code>servicePrincipalName</code> attribute assigned to <code>HTTP/machine1.domain.com</code> and <code>HTTP/machine1</code> (but I think, that only first is needed).</p>\n\n<p>It's worth to follow this tutorial: <a href=\"http://incepttechnologies.blogspot.in/p/weblogic.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kerberos / SPNEGO based SSO (Single Sign-On) in Weblogic</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does my CAS works:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Using above tutorial, I create SPN for the existing user <em>service_xxx</em> (user which may log into <em>machine1</em>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>setspn -s HTTP/machine1.domain.com  service_xxx\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>User <em>service_xxx</em> has such properties in Active Directory: AES 128 bit encryption and AES 256 bit encryption.</p>\n\n<p>Both operations were done by Active Directory administrator (he has sufficient privileges).</p>\n\n<p>So <code>service_xxx</code> is principal name (user name) and <code>HTTP/machine1.domain.com</code> is only SPN attribute assigned to the principal. As far as I understood - now CAS server running on machine <code>machine1.domain.com</code> (this is machine URL) can obtain any information from AD (LDAP) by user <code>service_xxx</code>. So CAS server can also authenticate any user using Kerberos protocol. In my opinion, this is why the CAS property <code>jcifsServicePrincipal</code> should point to principal <code>service_xxx@domain.com</code> (full principal name with @domain.com) and not to its SPN attribute name (unless they are equal strings).</p>\n\n<p><strong>My configuration details:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Principal with AES attributes and SPN attribute set</li>\n<li>Java with <em>Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength</em> installed</li>\n<li>Keytab created using <code>ktab.exe</code> tool from JDK </li>\n<li><code>login.conf</code> file - the same as in <a href=\"https://apereo.github.io/cas/5.1.x/installation/SPNEGO-Authentication.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">CAS documentation</a></li>\n<li><code>cas.properties</code> and <code>krb5.conf</code> as shown below</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Keytab</strong></p>\n\n<p>Key tab creation procedure (no any special privileges require):</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre1.8.0_131\\bin\\ktab.exe\" -a service_xxx -n 0 -k cas.keytab\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>-k</code> specifies key tab output file name. <code>-n 0</code> specifies KNVO number. Disclaimer: for my user cn=service_xxx in Active Directory there is no attribute <code>msDS-KeyVersionNumber</code> (KNVO), so I used 0. But I think that Windows ignores the KNVO number - see <a href=\"https://serverfault.com/questions/601270/retreive-the-current-kerberos-kvno-from-active-directory#comment711624_601270\">this comment</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One more information about <strong>keytab</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>A lot of tutorials and even official <a href=\"https://apereo.github.io/cas/5.1.x/installation/SPNEGO-Authentication.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">documentation</a> suggest to make keytab using <code>ktpass.exe</code>. Unfortunately this requires AD admin privilege, so this is not a good idea. Better use <code>ktab.exe</code> from JDK (as above). You only need to remember always generating new keytab after <code>service_xxx</code> password change.</p>\n\n<p>To test key tab there several options:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>use kinit to gather kerberos ticket (for service_xxx principal). This is also tool supplied by JDK.</li>\n<li>Try this small app written by @Ivan Veselovsky from SO: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/13859217/5162026\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/13859217/5162026</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><code>cas.properties</code> which works for me:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>cas.authn.spnego.kerberosConf=/etc/cas/config/krb5.conf\ncas.authn.spnego.jcifsServicePrincipal=service_xxx@domain.com\ncas.authn.spnego.loginConf=file:/etc/cas/config/login.conf\ncas.authn.spnego.kerberosRealm=DOMAIN.COM\n\ncas.authn.spnego.principal.principalAttribute=sAMAccountName\n\ncas.authn.spnego.ldap.ldapUrl=ldap://path.to.ldap.domain.com \ncas.authn.spnego.ldap.baseDn=DC=domain,DC=com #this is base dn where LDAP starts searching for users\ncas.authn.spnego.ldap.bindDn=cn=SERVICE_XXX,DC=domain,DC=com #it's a kind of login to LDAP\ncas.authn.spnego.ldap.failFast=false\ncas.authn.spnego.ldap.subtreeSearch=true\ncas.authn.spnego.ldap.useSsl=false\ncas.authn.spnego.ldap.searchFilter=cn={host}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is funny that paths like <code>/etc/cas/config</code> works also on Windows and points to <code>C:</code> drive root - so <code>C:\\etc\\cas\\config</code>.

As per the [definition][1], `PreStop` hook runs immediately before a container is terminated due to an API request or management event such as liveness probe failure, preemption, resource contention and others.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n&gt; Should I use preStop hook to capture Java Heap Dump before pod\r\n&gt; termination?\r\n\r\nYes. But you need to be careful, a call to the preStop hook fails if the container is already in terminated or completed state. When the [pod is terminated][2], it waits for default 30 second grace period (with additional 2 seconds if PerStop hook is not completed) before sending KILL signal. If the preStop hook needs longer to complete than the default grace period allows, you must modify `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` to suit this.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n&gt; Any more elegant solution to this?\r\n\r\nNot I am aware of. I guess by adding an [empty dir][3] volume to the pod, and configuring the JVM to do the heap dumps to that directory `command: [&quot;java&quot;, &quot;-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError&quot;, &quot;-XX:HeapDumpPath=/dumps/oom.bin&quot;, &quot;-jar&quot;, &quot;yourapp.jar&quot;]` should work.\r\n\r\n&gt; Why the above solution will work?\r\n\r\nWhen kubernetes kills your container because it is not responding to the health check, the kubernetes will just restart the container, but it will not reschedule the pod, so it will not move it to another node. Hence the empty dir volume is not deleted until the pod is moved to another node. Hence when the container is restarted, the new container will mount the same empty dir, which will contain the heap dump from the previous run. So you can `kubectl cp` those files at any time after the event. There might be other challenges to copy the heap dump files but they are solvable.

Although visitor seems more reasonable, he asked us to find possible reasons to choose the listener method over visitor.\r\n\r\nHere&#180;s the title of the exercise:\r\nLet us assume a language of logical expressions called EXPL with the following expressive resources: variables, integers, functions, predicates, negation, conjunction, disjunction, implication and universal and existential quantifiers. The predicates and functions are prefix symbols with the exceptions of the relational predicates equal to, greater than, less than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to and distinct and the functions addition, subtraction, product and division which are infixes.\r\nAn example of the EXPL expressions is:\r\n\r\n    1. FORALL x,y:(p(f(x)+2-3*5) OR r(x,y) =&gt; EXISTS z:(z+2 == 15)) \r\n    2. FORALL x,y:(p(x) AND NOT r(x,y) =&gt; z == x)\r\n    3. (result == i AND i&lt;=numberOfElements(v))\r\n\r\nThe semantic problem that we have to treat is that: whenever we find an entry with universal &#39;FORALL&#39; or existencial &#39;EXISTS&#39; openning, we have to make sure that the variables declared right next to these operators are used at least once in the logical expression that follows them, for example in this entry:\r\n\r\n    FORALL x,y:(p(f(x)+2-3*5) OR r(x,y) =&gt; EXISTS z:(z+2 == 15)) \r\n\r\nWe have to make sure that the variables declared: `x,y` show up at least once in the logical expression next to it.    \r\n                                                                             `(p(f(x)+2-3*5) OR r(x,y) =&gt; EXISTS z:(z+2 == 15))` \r\nIn this case is correct because they appear here `f(x)` and here `r(x,y)`at least once.\r\n\r\nAlso we would  have to  check  `EXISTS z:(z+2 == 15)` \r\nchecking if the variable `z` show up in the `(z+2 == 15)` expression, which is also correct.\r\n\r\nNow, regarding the visitor or listener situation, it seems a good reason to choose the visitor method becase we would go through the tree generated only looking for the expressions that are quantifiers returning for example a bool variable that checks whether the variables appear on the right expression or not. If we used a listener method, we would have to create global variables in order to store the variables since we cannot return anything, and then we would have to clear the lists or sets that we would use so that when it enters in the rule again the global variables are clean.\r\n\r\nI have seen that a good other reason to choose a listeners is because they use an explicit stack allocated on the heap, whereas visitor uses call stack to manage tree traversals. This might lead to StackOverFlow exceptions while using visitor on deeply nested ASTs.\r\nI would like to know more pros regarding the use of listeners for this exercise. \r\nIf the problem is not clear enough I can specify more, let me know!\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","title":"Listener vs visitor in this exercise","body":"<p>We have this exercise that we have to do in class and the professor asked us to figure out good reasons to choose the listener method over visitor method in order to implement a solution for a semantic problem.

(result == i AND i&lt;=numberOfElements(v))\n</code></pre>\n<p>The semantic problem that we have to treat is that: whenever we find an entry with universal 'FORALL' or existencial 'EXISTS' openning, we have to make sure that the variables declared right next to these operators are used at least once in the logical expression that follows them, for example in this entry:</p>\n<pre><code>FORALL x,y:(p(f(x)+2-3*5) OR r(x,y) =&gt; EXISTS z:(z+2 == 15)) \n</code></pre>\n<p>We have to make sure that the variables declared: <code>x,y</code> show up at least once in the logical expression next to it.<br />\n<code>(p(f(x)+2-3*5) OR r(x,y) =&gt; EXISTS z:(z+2 == 15))</code>\nIn this case is correct because they appear here <code>f(x)</code> and here <code>r(x,y)</code>at least once.</p>\n<p>Also we would  have to  check  <code>EXISTS z:(z+2 == 15)</code>\nchecking if the variable <code>z</code> show up in the <code>(z+2 == 15)</code> expression, which is also correct.</p>\n<p>Now, regarding the visitor or listener situation, it seems a good reason to choose the visitor method becase we would go through the tree generated only looking for the expressions that are quantifiers returning for example a bool variable that checks whether the variables appear on the right expression or not. If we used a listener method, we would have to create global variables in order to store the variables since we cannot return anything, and then we would have to clear the lists or sets that we would use so that when it enters in the rule again the global variables are clean.</p>\n<p>I have seen that a good other reason to choose a listeners is because they use an explicit stack allocated on the heap, whereas visitor uses call stack to manage tree traversals. This might lead to StackOverFlow exceptions while using visitor on deeply nested ASTs.\nI would like to know more pros regarding the use of listeners for this exercise.\nIf the problem is not clear enough I can specify more, let me know!\nThanks!</p>\n"},{"tags":["java"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":11347613,"reputation":679,"user_id":8319640,"display_name":"Kishan Mevada"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1659499974,"creation_date":1659499974,"answer_id":73216215,"question_id":73216176,"body_markdown":"It is just simple `ImageButton`\r\n\r\nYou can set this button using following code : \r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;ImageButton\r\n      android:id=&quot;@+id/button&quot;\r\n      android:layout_width=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n      android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n      android:src=&quot;@drawable/home&quot; /&gt; &lt;!--Add Your Icon Here In Drawable--&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, Just set simple `View.OnClickListener()` \r\n\r\n```\r\nfindViewById(R.id.button).setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void onClick(View view) {\r\n                //Handle Your Click Here\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n```","title":"How to make this kind of button?","body":"<p>It is just simple <code>ImageButton</code></p>\n<p>You can set this button using following code :</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;ImageButton\n      android:id=&quot;@+id/button&quot;\n      android:layout_width=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\n      android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\n      android:src=&quot;@drawable/home&quot; /&gt; &lt;!--Add Your Icon Here In Drawable--&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>After that, Just set simple <code>View.OnClickListener()</code></p>\n<pre><code>findViewById(R.id.button).setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\n            @Override\n            public void onClick(View view) {\n                //Handle Your Click Here\n            }\n        });\n</code></pre>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":25962960,"reputation":1,"user_id":19679281,"display_name":"Newbie"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1659501751,"accepted_answer_id":73216215,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1659499974,"creation_date":1659499524,"question_id":73216176,"body_markdown":"I am creating a currency converter and I want to create a button that switches or swaps values.
