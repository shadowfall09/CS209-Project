Description is not enough detailed to apply it for my example.\r\n\r\nOne more tutorial I&#39;ve found:\r\n[Websocket Authentication and Authorization in Spring\r\nAsk][3]\r\n\r\nIt looks more clear but I am not sure that it is the best solution for now.\r\n\r\nCan you advise the simplest way to configure spring security for my application?\r\n\r\n**P.S.** Also I&#39;ve found not the same but familiar question https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48903044/how-to-secure-websocket-application-spring-boot-stomp but there are no answers at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPDATE for **locus2k**\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I have following configuration:\r\n\r\n    @Configuration\r\n    @EnableWebSocketMessageBroker\r\n    public class WebSocketConfig extends AbstractSecurityWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {\r\n        private static String[] authorities = new String[]{\r\n                &quot;VIEW_SCRIPT_TAB&quot;, &quot;VIEW_CREDS_TAB&quot;\r\n        };\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void registerStompEndpoints(StompEndpointRegistry registry) {\r\n            registry\r\n                    .addEndpoint(&quot;/gs-guide-websocket&quot;)\r\n                    .addInterceptors(new HandshakeInterceptor() {\r\n                        @Override\r\n                        public boolean beforeHandshake(ServerHttpRequest request, ServerHttpResponse response, WebSocketHandler wsHandler, Map&lt;String, Object&gt;

the knowledge.\r\n\r\nEdited for a little more clarity.","title":"Spring-Retry doesn&#39;t get a new database connection from HikariCP","body":"<p>I know that spring-retry doesn't grab database connections.</p>\n<p>We've wrapped a REST endpoint with @Retryable in an attempt to enact retry functionality but its not quite working as expected. I had anticipated that when a SQLException is thrown due to a <code>com.mysql.cj.jdbc.exceptions.CommunicationsException: Communications link failure</code> that the next attempt would grab a new connection from the pool.  I'm facing an issue whereby if we take down the MySQL database part way through processing, spring-retry retries the method call, but does not get a new database connection. As a result all retries fail but new requests to the REST endpoint work successfully. Is there a way I can force a new connection from the datasource.?</p>\n<p>I know that Spring-retry knows nothing about the code being run, but I'm bewildered why the connection, having just thrown an exception, isn't ditched and a new one pulled from the pool given the datasource configuration.

For example, Bicycle has one constructor:</p>\n<pre><code>public Bicycle(int startCadence, int startSpeed, int startGear) {\n    gear = startGear;\n    cadence = startCadence;\n    speed = startSpeed;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>To create a new Bicycle object called <code>myBike</code>, a constructor is called by the new operator:</p>\n<pre><code>Bicycle myBike = new Bicycle(30, 0, 8);\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>new Bicycle(30, 0, 8)</code> creates space in memory for the object and initializes its fields.</p>\n<p>Although Bicycle only has one constructor, it could have others, including a no-argument constructor:</p>\n<pre><code>public Bicycle() {\n   gear = 1;\n   cadence = 10;\n   speed = 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>Bicycle yourBike = new Bicycle();</code> invokes the no-argument constructor to create a new Bicycle object called yourBike.</p>\n</blockquote>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1205496,"reputation":7798,"user_id":1175253,"display_name":"Sam"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1384298492,"creation_date":1384297861,"answer_id":19941890,"question_id":19941825,"body_markdown":" * Through a constructor (with parameters), you can &#39;ask&#39; the user of that class for required dependencies.\r\n * It is used to initialize instance variables\r\n * and to pass up arguments to the constructor of a super class (`super(...)`), which basically does the same\r\n * It can initialize (final) instance variables with code, that may throw Exceptions, as opposed to [instance initializer][1] scopes\r\n * One should **not** blindly call methods from within the constructor, because initialization may not be finished/sufficient in the local or a derived class.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/1355810/1175253","title":"Purpose of a constructor in Java?","body":"<ul>\n<li>Through a constructor (with parameters), you can 'ask' the user of that class for required dependencies.</li>\n<li>It is used to initialize instance variables</li>\n<li>and to pass up arguments to the constructor of a super class (<code>super(...)</code>), which basically does the same</li>\n<li>It can initialize (final) instance variables with code, that may throw Exceptions, as opposed to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/q/1355810/1175253\">instance initializer</a> scopes</li>\n<li>One should <strong>not</strong> blindly call methods from within the constructor, because initialization may not be finished/sufficient in the local or a derived class.</li>\n</ul>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":342027,"reputation":2802,"user_id":672958,"display_name":"andy.xyz"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1384298042,"creation_date":1384298042,"answer_id":19941929,"question_id":19941825,"body_markdown":"It&#39;s used to set up the contents and state of your class.\r\nWhilst it&#39;s true you can make the simpler example with the main method you only have 1 main method per app so it does not remain a sensible approach.\r\n\r\nConsider the main method to simply start your program and should know no more than how to do that.

facing a quite big problem since even if I do a correct use of JAXB API to mapping an xml string to a java object I get stuck.\r\nTo save time, I will not write the real fields but the general schema

         &lt;G3&gt;&lt;/G3&gt;\r\n        &lt;/G&gt;\r\n    &lt;/A&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nSo in this situation I have a class A build as,\r\n\r\n    @XmlRootElement(name = &quot;A&quot;)\r\n    @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)\r\n    public class A{\r\n     \r\n       @XmlElement(name = &quot;B&quot;)\r\n\t   private B objB;\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n       @XmlElement(name = &quot;C&quot;)\r\n       private String objC= &quot;&quot;;\r\n    \r\n       @XmlElement(name = &quot;E&quot;)\r\n       private String objE= &quot;&quot;;\r\n    \r\n       @XmlElement(name = &quot;F&quot;)\r\n\t   private F objF;\r\n\t\r\n       @XmlElement(name = &quot;D&quot;)\r\n\t   private D objD;\r\n\t\r\n       @XmlElement(name = &quot;G&quot;)\r\n\t   private G objG;\r\n\r\nSo the wrapper class A has an attribute of the object related to the proper portion of XML. Hence, each letter has its own class which represent an object inside my project. \r\nUsing this:\r\n \r\n\r\n    JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(A.class);\r\n    Unmarshaller unmarshaller = jaxbContext.createUnmarshaller();\r\n\r\n    StringReader reader = new StringReader(&quot;xml string here&quot;);\r\n    A element= (A) unmarshaller.unmarshal(reader);\r\n\r\nI cannot properly map my xml string in my custom nested object. So my goal is to map the whole xml string in the A class which will automatically map its attribute which are xml portion of the string as well.

Is there any solution?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","arrays","conditional-statements"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":3830865,"reputation":13432,"user_id":3176419,"accept_rate":50,"display_name":"flyingfox"},"score":1,"creation_date":1665029409,"post_id":73968578,"comment_id":130604625,"body_markdown":"`&amp;&amp; hasLoyaltyCard == true` should better to  use `&amp;&amp; hasLoyaltyCard` instead,and seems you need to put `totalWeight = weight + totalWeight` outside `if`","body":"<code>&amp;&amp; hasLoyaltyCard == true</code> should better to  use <code>&amp;&amp; hasLoyaltyCard</code> instead,and seems you need to put <code>totalWeight = weight + totalWeight</code> outside <code>if</code>"},{"owner":{"account_id":5907283,"reputation":1464,"user_id":4648586,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"Bagus Tesa"},"score":0,"creation_date":1665029527,"post_id":73968578,"comment_id":130604638,"body_markdown":"*&quot;But when I run it in vocareum, it&#39;s not working&quot;* - so.. call me dumb, but what is this vocareum? do they have some kind web-based java compiler or something?","body":"<i>&quot;But when I run it in vocareum, it&#39;s not working&quot;</i> - so.. call me dumb, but what is this vocareum? do they have some kind web-based java compiler or something?"},{"owner":{"account_id":5907283,"reputation":1464,"user_id":4648586,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"Bagus Tesa"},"score":0,"creation_date":1665029819,"post_id":73968578,"comment_id":130604677,"body_markdown":"thing is, i take a look on your code and still can&#39;t find whats wrong. i took your code to jdoodle (online java compiler) and it works just fine. thats why i suspect something with the platform (that vocareum) might be the cause, not java itself.","body":"thing is, i take a look on your code and still can&#39;t find whats wrong. i took your code to jdoodle (online java compiler) and it works just fine. thats why i suspect something with the platform (that vocareum) might be the cause, not java itself."},{"owner":{"account_id":6520,"reputation":10523,"user_id":11002,"accept_rate":75,"display_name":"tgdavies"},"score":0,"creation_date":1665030407,"post_id":73968578,"comment_id":130604773,"body_markdown":"What does &quot;not working&quot; mean?","body":"What does &quot;not working&quot; mean?"},{"owner":{"account_id":26541411,"reputation":1,"user_id":20172095,"display_name":"francois vang"},"score":0,"creation_date":1665049177,"post_id":73968578,"comment_id":130609894,"body_markdown":"@BagusTesa They don&#39;t compile my code, they give me a set of instructions of what to do then afterwards run a check on it using a bash command.
