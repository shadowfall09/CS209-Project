This seemed to work fine. However I am starting to get a little confused. Here we have the subclasses in *is a* relationships, some card **is a** card. I am failing to map this in to database tables though.\r\n\r\nFor example, to incorporate the process of a card table in the database I could have a table for each sub class type, and inside this table i could have an id which references a card table (which is generated when a user registers). But, this now means that in my database I have transformed the is a relationship in to has a? *The subclass now has a card rather than is a card.* \r\n\r\nI am confused and hope someone can clear things up for me.\r\n\r\nThanks","title":"Confused with potential is a and has a relationship","body":"<p>I am trying to configure a new database design seeing as we have decided to make the move to Hibernate.

Be sure that your pfx file has the private key and the cert chain when you export it. There is no need to convert to other formats. The trick is to obtain the <em>Alias</em> of your pfx file:</p>\n\n<pre><code> keytool -list -storetype pkcs12 -keystore your_pfx_file -v | grep Alias\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once you have your alias, signing is easy</p>\n\n<pre><code>jarsigner.exe -storetype pkcs12 -keystore pfx_file jar_file \"your alias\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above two commands will prompt you for the password you specified at pfx export. If you want to have your password hang out in clear text use the <strong>-storepass</strong> switch before the <strong>-keystore</strong> switch </p>\n\n<p>Once signed, admire your work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>jarsigner.exe -verify -verbose -certs  yourjarfile\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":98540,"reputation":3070,"user_id":266659,"accept_rate":48,"display_name":"kaptan"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":34,"is_accepted":false,"score":34,"last_activity_date":1655169172,"creation_date":1342742186,"answer_id":11571008,"question_id":4217107,"body_markdown":"I found [this][1] page which tells you how to import a PFX to JKS (Java Key Store):\r\n\r\n```\r\nkeytool -importkeystore -srckeystore PFX_P12_FILE_NAME -srcstoretype pkcs12 \r\n-srcstorepass PFX_P12_FILE -srcalias SOURCE_ALIAS -destkeystore KEYSTORE_FILE \r\n-deststoretype jks -deststorepass PASSWORD -destalias ALIAS_NAME\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://support.comodo.com/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=1283","title":"How to convert .pfx file to keystore with private key?","body":"<p>I found <a href=\"https://support.comodo.com/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=1283\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> page which tells you how to import a PFX to JKS (Java Key Store):</p>\n<pre><code>keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore PFX_P12_FILE_NAME -srcstoretype pkcs12 \n-srcstorepass PFX_P12_FILE -srcalias SOURCE_ALIAS -destkeystore KEYSTORE_FILE \n-deststoretype jks -deststorepass PASSWORD -destalias ALIAS_NAME\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":2268036,"reputation":628,"user_id":1996150,"display_name":"Mariano Paniga"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1381670218,"creation_date":1381670218,"answer_id":19345701,"question_id":4217107,"body_markdown":"If you work with JDK 1.5 or below the keytool utility will not have the `-importkeystore` option (see [JDK 1.5 keytool documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/solaris/keytool.html)) and the solution by MikeD will be available only by transferring the `.pfx` on a machine with a newer JDK (1.6 or above).\r\n\r\nAnother option in JDK 1.5 or below (if you have Oracle WebLogic product), is to follow the instructions from this Oracle document: [Using PFX and PEM Certificate Formats with Keystores](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/entarch/pfx-pem-certificate-formats-092744.html).\r\nIt describes the conversion into `.pem` format, how to extract certificates information from this textual format, and import it into `.jks` format with `java utils.ImportPrivateKey` utility (this is an utility included with WebLogic product).","title":"How to convert .pfx file to keystore with private key?","body":"<p>If you work with JDK 1.5 or below the keytool utility will not have the <code>-importkeystore</code> option (see <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/solaris/keytool.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">JDK 1.5 keytool documentation</a>) and the solution by MikeD will be available only by transferring the <code>.pfx</code> on a machine with a newer JDK (1.6 or above).</p>\n\n<p>Another option in JDK 1.5 or below (if you have Oracle WebLogic product), is to follow the instructions from this Oracle document: <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/entarch/pfx-pem-certificate-formats-092744.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Using PFX and PEM Certificate Formats with Keystores</a>.\nIt describes the conversion into <code>.pem</code> format, how to extract certificates information from this textual format, and import it into <code>.jks</code> format with <code>java utils.ImportPrivateKey</code> utility (this is an utility included with WebLogic product).</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":3984888,"reputation":21,"user_id":3285791,"display_name":"TechIsFun"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1391814873,"creation_date":1391813430,"answer_id":21639212,"question_id":4217107,"body_markdown":"Justin(above) is accurate.

I am assuming this isn't possible with Selenium due to the reason that, the written code needs to be compiled to <code>.class</code> file but I may be wrong. Could you please help me know if there is any other alternative?  I know Debugging is possible in eclipse by enabling <strong>Break Points</strong> however I'd need to execute the code from the beginning. This doesn't serve the purpose just as <strong>Debug from step</strong> in QTP. Thank you.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","apache-kafka","apache-flink"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":2671330,"reputation":183376,"user_id":2308683,"accept_rate":90,"display_name":"OneCricketeer"},"score":0,"creation_date":1655211545,"post_id":72616532,"comment_id":128274326,"body_markdown":"Unrelated, but you really shouldn&#39;t write and read just to set different fields in your json object.

Meaning, as long as the SQL string is the same when you create a prepared statement and you are using the same connection *it is not re-parsed*, but only compared as opaque string for the cache lookup (see `org.h2.jdbc.JdbcConnection#prepareCommand(...)`).\r\n\r\nYou can configure the query cache size with the parameter `QUERY_CACHE_SIZE`—more info [here](https://www.h2database.com/javadoc/org/h2/engine/DbSettings.html#queryCacheSize).\r\n\r\nDepending on your usage scenario, you might want to experiment with not using a connection pool at all. E.g. as embedded database, you don&#39;t really have high connection costs. You might experience a greater performance gain when using only a single connection (more cache hits; lower memory consumption, because you don&#39;t duplicate your caches).
