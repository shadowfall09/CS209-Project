And even worse, I am completely new to macOS. So one code line -&gt; one google search, taking a lot of time. My life was all along with Window.</p>\n<p>This time I was trying to do study JSP / Spring. During process, I got message like this -</p>\n<p><strong>http://localhost:8081/Hello/index.jsp\nPage load failed with error: The resource could not be loaded because the App Transport Security policy requires the use of a secure connection.</strong></p>\n<p>(* I changed the port 8080 to 8081 because I got error saying port 8080 is already occupied even though I do not use it anywhere. I even killed entire process on terminal\n<code>kill -9 pid</code>. And I was still getting same error msg)</p>\n<p>I am currently using M1 macbook air. I have tried some several things after I searched on google.</p>\n<p>To note, I installed Apache Tomcat 9.0 and located them in -</p>\n<pre><code>/usr/local/apache-tomcat-9.0.50\n</code></pre>\n<p>and gave them sudo chmod using terminal.</p>\n<p>And I downloaded java as -</p>\n<pre><code>java version &quot;1.8.0_291&quot;\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_291-b10)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.291-b10, mixed mode)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Firstly, I downloaded openJDK16 using Homebrew command. I deleted it and installed jdk 1.8 on oracle official website, which I think irrelevant.</p>\n<p>Couple of things I have tried -</p>\n<ol>\n<li>reinstalled entire os (BigSur)</li>\n<li>changed Info.plist on java local directory.

The solution is here:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DatabaseReference rootRef = FirebaseDatabase.getInstance().getReference();\nDatabaseReference userNameRef = rootRef.child(\"Users\").child(\"Nick123\");\nValueEventListener eventListener = new ValueEventListener() {\n@Override\npublic void onDataChange(DataSnapshot dataSnapshot) {\n    if(!dataSnapshot.exists()) {\n        //create new user\n    }\n}\n\n    @Override\n    public void onCancelled(DatabaseError databaseError) {}\n};\nuserNameRef.addListenerForSingleValueEvent(eventListener);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And my database looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>users\n    (auto-generated push token ID)\n        fullname\n        username\n        gender\n        ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I don't know whether it's the right method but I used push() method for adding the user object to the database and this method generates push token ID like above. </p>\n\n<p>So, in order not to create duplicate users, what should I change with the above solution? Is there a better method to do this? Maybe like checking the firebase uid with some firebase auth methods?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>\nMy database screenshot:\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zKUW8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zKUW8.png\" alt=\"database\"></a>\nAs you see the string just below 'users' is not the same as user's uid. </p>\n"},{"tags":["java","perfect-square"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":1223835,"reputation":75858,"user_id":1189885,"accept_rate":43,"display_name":"chrylis -cautiouslyoptimistic-"},"score":2,"creation_date":1569351969,"post_id":58086705,"comment_id":102567099,"body_markdown":"You should probably either put the perfect squares you find in a list, or just sum them and keep a counter of how many there are.","body":"You should probably either put the perfect squares you find in a list, or just sum them and keep a counter of how many there are."},{"owner":{"account_id":183966,"reputation":14606,"user_id":419705,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"Roddy of the Frozen Peas"},"score":0,"creation_date":1569352434,"post_id":58086705,"comment_id":102567300,"body_markdown":"Your code seems to be doing exactly what you said you needed it to be doing, though that&#39;s really not the best way of testing for perfect-squaredness....","body":"Your code seems to be doing exactly what you said you needed it to be doing, though that&#39;s really not the best way of testing for perfect-squaredness...."},{"owner":{"account_id":183966,"reputation":14606,"user_id":419705,"accept_rate":67,"display_name":"Roddy of the Frozen Peas"},"score":0,"creation_date":1569352635,"post_id":58086705,"comment_id":102567377,"body_markdown":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34056609/how-to-check-if-an-integer-is-a-perfect-square","body":"<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34056609/how-to-check-if-an-integer-is-a-perfect-square\" title=\"how to check if an integer is a perfect square\">stackoverflow.com/questions/34056609/&hellip;</a>"},{"owner":{"account_id":31180,"reputation":29173,"user_id":85421,"display_name":"user85421"},"score":0,"creation_date":1569352677,"post_id":58086705,"comment_id":102567400,"body_markdown":"lets start analyzing the problem: what is the exact definition of a perfect square?","body":"lets start analyzing the problem: what is the exact definition of a perfect square?"},{"owner":{"account_id":1085259,"reputation":78314,"user_id":1081110,"display_name":"Dawood ibn Kareem"},"score":0,"creation_date":1569353071,"post_id":58086705,"comment_id":102567553,"body_markdown":"@RoddyoftheFrozenPeas If this code gets the answer right, it&#39;s only by accident, because OP is never rounding the square root.","body":"@RoddyoftheFrozenPeas If this code gets the answer right, it&#39;s only by accident, because OP is never rounding the square root."}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":1137016,"reputation":5916,"user_id":1121883,"display_name":"Liviu Stirb"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569399424,"creation_date":1569352419,"answer_id":58086852,"question_id":58086705,"body_markdown":"A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of two equal integers so it must be an int after the sqrt.

And remove the strict mode setting so that in the future your program properly warns you of things like this.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":16384867,"reputation":249,"user_id":11835023,"display_name":"shrimpcolo"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1634269049,"creation_date":1634269049,"answer_id":69579709,"question_id":69576987,"body_markdown":"You should notice that changing the View (set value or sth.) is in the scope:\r\n```\r\nrunOnUiThread(new Runnable() {\r\n                    public void run() {\r\n                        //Toptext.setText(&quot;네트워크 연결 오류&quot;);\r\n                        ....\r\n                        temphum.setText(&quot;data = &quot; + sensor);\r\n                    }\r\n                });\r\n```\r\nYou can follow and try it.
