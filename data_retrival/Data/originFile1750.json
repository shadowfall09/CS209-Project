These classes supplant the troublesome old [legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system) date-time classes such as [`java.util.Date`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Date.html), [`Calendar`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html), &amp; [`SimpleDateFormat`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html).\r\n\r\nTo learn more, see the [*Oracle Tutorial*](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/TOC.html). And search Stack Overflow for many examples and explanations. Specification is [JSR 310](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310).\r\n\r\nThe [*Joda-Time*](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) project, now in [maintenance mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_mode), advises migration to the [java.time](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html) classes.\r\n\r\nYou may exchange *java.time* objects directly with your database. Use a [JDBC driver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDBC_driver) compliant with [JDBC 4.2](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/170) or later. No need for strings, no need for `java.sql.*` classes.\r\n\r\nWhere to obtain the java.time classes? \r\n\r\n - [**Java SE 8**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_8), [**Java SE 9**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_9), [**Java SE 10**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_10), [**Java SE 11**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_11), and later  - Part of the standard Java API with a bundled implementation.\r\n  - Java 9 adds some minor features and fixes.\r\n - [**Java SE 6**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_6) and [**Java SE 7**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_7)\r\n  - Most of the *java.time* functionality is back-ported to Java 6 &amp; 7 in [***ThreeTen-Backport***](http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/).\r\n - [**Android**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system))\r\n  - Later versions of Android bundle implementations of the *java.time* classes.\r\n  - For earlier Android (&lt;26), the [***ThreeTenABP***](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP) project adapts [***ThreeTen-Backport***](http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/) (mentioned above).

Files are represented by the Filesystems API, so you&#39;ll be using it for sure. It&#39;s not a problem that FileObject manages an extension, as it will be a &quot;&quot; string in case your files don&#39;t have an extension.\r\n\r\n2. DataObjects are another piece. You use them to represent a model entity which is backed by a file (a FileObject, to be precise) **and** has got some semantics (that you usually implement by subclassing DataObject and adding methods). With &quot;some semantics&quot; I mean something more than merely having a bunch of data such as a sequence of bytes, but data that are interpreted. I mean: if your application is going to provide the typical functions of a file system explorer, that is copying, moving, deleting files etc..., the FileSystems API is enough: you don&#39;t need to interpret data. If you e.g. want to implement a photo manipulation application, which also offers functions such as filtering etc..., it&#39;s likely that you need to have a PhotoDataObject subclassing DataObject where you put the extra semantics. This implies having methods for reading the data from the file and creating e.g. a BufferedImage, or another representation. This is just a rough way to introduce things, but we can refine to details later. DataObjects are of course and additional complexity over FileObjects, and you should use them only if you need them.\r\n\r\n3. Your question about Nodes and Children is related to displaying stuff, rather than manipulating it (for which DataObject and FileObject are enough). The Nodes API is a generic one for creating a presentation model, that is a data structure that is rendered on the screen. It can be anything you want, of course including a FileSystem or DataObject.

So, I&#39;d say that definitely at some point you need DataObjects. The key points:\r\n\r\n1. To &quot;link&quot; DataObjects to FileObjetcs you need a DataLoader. It&#39;s a factory of DataObjects, that gets activated only for some kind of files. Basically:\r\n\r\n        DataObject dataObject = DataObject.find(fileObject);\r\n\r\n See http://wiki.netbeans.org/DevFaqDataLoader\r\n\r\n2. While it&#39;s common for a DataLoader to use a file extension to ack a file type, it&#39;s not the only way to go. Indeed, DataLoaders use MIME types and a MIMEResolver class can be used to assign a MIME type to a given file. Again, the easiest thing is to look at the extension, but your code can also look at contents to guess (http://wiki.netbeans.org/DevFaqFileRecognition). Basically you have to implement your MIMEResolver with a single method:\r\n\r\n        public String findMIMEType (FileObject fileObject);\r\n\r\nthat can do whatever it wants, then you register the MIMEResolver into the system (see http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/doc-files/HOWTO-MIME.html for details).\r\n\r\nAt this point, DataObject.find() will be able to instantiate your own subclass of DataObject.\r\n\r\n3. DataObject has got a createNodeDelegate() which can be used to create a Node to put into an view for rendering. It will automaticaly render with the name of the DataObject, which by default is the name of the FileObject. If I recall correctly (but at the moment I&#39;m unsure), the Platform on its own should be able to create the proper DataObject for a directory, which would automatically create a Node with children for each contained file.\r\n\r\n4. For looking at contents, you might have a look at the Editor API. Unfortunately I&#39;m not acquainted with it, but generically speaking it should be activatable again by using MIME types, that its associating the MIME type you&#39;ve previously defined to a &quot;plain text&quot; style.

So there's no compelling reason to make the implementation of the language more complex and incur significant cost now and well into the future to support it.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":5284961,"reputation":3326,"user_id":4219264,"accept_rate":60,"display_name":"Serban Stoenescu"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1435585960,"creation_date":1435585960,"answer_id":31117496,"question_id":31117132,"body_markdown":"You can restrict the scope of your variable to make it visible only in the if statement like this:\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);\r\n    //use a codeblock to restrict access\r\n    {\r\n      int i = 4;\r\n      if(i!=0)\r\n      {\r\n\t    System.out.println(&quot;i = &quot;+i);// this is OK\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;i = &quot;+i);//this is not OK","title":"Why can&#39;t we declare variables in if statement?","body":"<p>You can restrict the scope of your variable to make it visible only in the if statement like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>System.out.println(\"Hello World!\");\n//use a codeblock to restrict access\n{\n  int i = 4;\n  if(i!=0)\n  {\n    System.out.println(\"i = \"+i);// this is OK\n  }\n}\nSystem.out.println(\"i = \"+i);//this is not OK\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":947184,"reputation":48994,"user_id":974186,"accept_rate":79,"display_name":"Ren&#233; Link"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1603166375,"creation_date":1435585978,"answer_id":31117503,"question_id":31117132,"body_markdown":"&gt; why can&#39;t we declare variables in the `if` statement?\r\n\r\nBecause the [Java Language Specification][1] does not allow it.\r\n\r\n&gt; if I write `if(int i){}` then I could use `i` only for if the scope\r\n\r\nYou can use blocks\r\n```\r\npublic void someMethod() {\r\n  {\r\n    int i = 1; // visible only to the current block\r\n  } {\r\n    int i = 0; // visible only to the current block\r\n    if (i == 0) {\r\n      System.out.println(&quot;i = &quot; + i);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // compiler error, because i is not visible outside the block\r\n  System.out.println(i);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this decreases the readability of your code.

And you should. Better to have smaller chunks of code with a specific narrow purpose, segregated into well-named methods.\r\n\r\nYou will see in the code below that we broke out your code into two principal methods: \r\n\r\n - a constructor\r\n - a method named `randomize`\r\n\r\n# OOP\r\n\r\nI think the bigger picture you are missing is [object-oriented programming (OOP)][1]. \r\n\r\nYour `Board` class should represent a board, describing a board from real life. A board has characteristics/attributes, in your case here, a size and set of integers (which I am guessing represents slots or positions on the board). So your class should represent those attributes as [*state*][2], as member field variables. \r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class Board\r\n{\r\n    // Member fields.\r\n    final private int boardSize;\r\n    final private List &lt; Integer &gt; slots;\r\n…\r\n```\r\n\r\nGet the basics of your board’s state ready in a constructor. Generally best to keep your constructor as short and as simple as possible. The goal is to do the least necessary to leave the object in a coherent state. \r\n\r\nIn our case here, perhaps the constructor should just establish the slots with the default 1, 2, 3, … sequencing. Our constructor takes one parameter, the size (50), as that is likely to be the one aspect of the board you are likely to change (my assumption). \r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Constructor\r\npublic Board ( final int boardSize )\r\n{\r\n    this.boardSize = boardSize;\r\n    this.slots = new ArrayList &lt;&gt;( this.boardSize );\r\n    // Populate the slots with sequential numbers, one through count of slots.\r\n    for ( int nthSlot = 1 ; nthSlot &lt;= this.boardSize ; nthSlot++ )\r\n    {\r\n        this.slots.add( nthSlot );\r\n    }\r\n    // Or more briefly, using streams:\r\n    // this.slots = new ArrayList &lt;&gt;( IntStream.rangeClosed( 1 , this.boardSize ).boxed().toList() );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour goal is to randomize the slots of the board. So create a method `randomize` to do that work.\r\n\r\nI question the logic of your code for the randomizing, but that code is not relevant to the point of your Question. So let’s skip that code, and simply replace each slot’s value with the result of a call to [`ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt`][3]. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate void randomize ( )\r\n{\r\n    for ( int index = 0 ; index &lt; this.boardSize ; index++ )\r\n    {\r\n        int absC = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt( 1_000 );\r\n        this.slots.set( index , absC );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe need a way to examine our board object. So we add another method, this one named `report`. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate void report ( )\r\n{\r\n    System.out.println( &quot;this.slots = &quot; + this.slots + &quot; at &quot; + Instant.now() );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&#128073; To get back to the point of your question, notice how **the state of the object** (the member fields `boardSize` &amp; `slots`) **is shared** between the various methods. Yes, methods could instead package their results as a return value. But in this case, all the methods are focused on working on this one board object. So we let those methods share access to the member fields. We let those the `Board` methods directly manipulate the `Board` object’s fields (state). \r\n\r\nAlso notice that we mark the member fields `private` to deny access by outside code. Only methods on `Board` class should be manipulating the state of a `Board` object (generally). Methods on other classes should be denied access (generally). \r\n\r\nThe choreographer to make our objects dance is the `main` method. \r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static void main ( String[] args )\r\n{\r\n    Board board = new Board( 50 );\r\n    board.report();\r\n    \r\n    board.randomize();\r\n    board.report();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPull all that code together.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage work.basil.game;\r\n\r\nimport java.time.Instant;\r\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\nimport java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;\r\n\r\npublic class Board\r\n{\r\n    // Member fields.\r\n    final private int boardSize;\r\n    final private List &lt; Integer &gt; slots;\r\n\r\n    // Constructor\r\n    public Board ( final int boardSize )\r\n    {\r\n        this.boardSize = boardSize;\r\n        this.slots = new ArrayList &lt;&gt;( this.boardSize );\r\n        // Populate the slots with sequential numbers, one through count of slots.\r\n        for ( int nthSlot = 1 ; nthSlot &lt;= this.boardSize ; nthSlot++ )\r\n        {\r\n            this.slots.add( nthSlot );\r\n        }\r\n        // Or more briefly, using streams.\r\n        // this.slots = new ArrayList &lt;&gt;( IntStream.rangeClosed( 1 , this.boardSize ).boxed().toList() );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Logic\r\n\r\n    private void randomize ( )\r\n    {\r\n        for ( int index = 0 ; index &lt; this.boardSize ; index++ )\r\n        {\r\n            int absC = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextInt( 1_000 );\r\n            this.slots.set( index , absC );\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private void report ( )\r\n    {\r\n        System.out.println( &quot;this.slots = &quot; + this.slots + &quot; at &quot; + Instant.now() );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void main ( String[] args )\r\n    {\r\n        Board board = new Board( 50 );\r\n        board.report();\r\n\r\n        board.randomize();\r\n        board.report();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen run.\r\n\r\n&gt;this.slots = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50] at 2021-12-17T23:09:04.872711Z\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;this.slots = [395, 335, 46, 691, 7, 799, 52, 354, 972, 127, 102, 767, 588, 126, 178, 762, 437, 895, 460, 222, 439, 316, 150, 445, 963, 878, 776, 820, 263, 457, 259, 513, 639, 102, 176, 828, 738, 866, 6, 540, 996, 511, 576, 52, 85, 833, 889, 498, 555, 925] at 2021-12-17T23:09:04.884395Z\r\n\r\nBy the way, notice the naming in the code here.

There are cases where `==` works on strings, due to Java&#39;s string interning, but that topic is beyond the scope here. So use `.equals()`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstack.pop().equals(comparableEndTag)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you want to check the top of the stack without popping (removing) the value form it, use `peek()` instead of `pop()`. \r\n```\r\n// peek() to not pop the value from the stack already on this line\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;Popped Starting tag: &quot; + stack.peek()); \r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you call `tests[i].split(&quot; &quot;, 5);` with value `5` as the second parameter (the 2nd parameter is limit), it means that you want only up to `limit - 1` splits to happen (that is explained in the documentation of the `split(String regex, int limit)` method). In your case, when there might be more than just 5 tags, use 0 for the second parameter, so that you split on all spaces, not just on the first 4.\r\n\r\nYour outer for loop and your inner for loop use the same counter variable `i`. That was probably not intended.\r\n\r\nHopefully these ideas/hints help you change your code and do the comparison correctly.

From wikipedia\r\n\r\n&gt; A call stack is used for several related purposes, but the main reason for having one is to keep track of the point to which each active subroutine should return control when it finishes executing. An active subroutine is one that has been called, but is yet to complete execution, after which control should be handed back to the point of call. Such activations of subroutines may be nested to any level (recursive as a special case), hence the stack structure.\r\n\r\nA call stack keeps track of calls that are still in progress by pushing (adding) stack frames on the stack every time a call happens and popping (removing) them when an active call returns.\r\n\r\nThe stack frames contain information about (simplified):\r\n 1. the values of the parameters of the call\r\n 2. the return address = the position in code to return to after the call finishes executing\r\n 3. the local variables of the called method, the context/scope\r\n\r\nThe stack and the stack frames make recursion calls possible.\r\n\r\nI know that you already used a debugger to step through the code while it was executing, but let&#39;s do it again here on &quot;paper&quot;.\r\n\r\nI will use line numbers in your code (I also removed the comments) to make it easier to reference the lines. The method that will be called recursively has 5 lines of code.\r\n```\r\n   boolean groupSum(int start, int[] nums, int target) {\r\n\r\n1:   if (start &gt;= nums.length) return (target == 0); \r\n\r\n2:   if (groupSum(start + 1, nums, target - nums[start])) return true;\r\n\r\n3:   if (groupSum(start + 1, nums, target)) return true;\r\n\r\n4:   System.out.println(&quot;test&quot;); // Why does it reach that point?\r\n\r\n5:   return false;\r\n\r\n   }\r\n```\r\nLet&#39;s take the call to `groupSum(0, [2, 4, 8], 9)` as an example.\r\n\r\nWhen some part of your code calls `groupSum(0, [2, 4, 8], 9)` it will push this call on the call stack (create a stack frame) and start executing the method body.\r\n\r\n```\r\nStack frame 1 created: groupSum(0, [2, 4, 8], 9)\r\nParameters: start = 0, target = 9, nums = [2, 4, 8]\r\n\r\n// Line 1 condition is false, so it keeps going\r\n// Line 2 calls groupSum(0 + 1, [2, 4, 8], 9 - 2)\r\n// which pushes a new stack frame on the call stack\r\n\r\nStack frame 2 created: groupSum(1, [2, 4, 8], 7)\r\nParameters: start = 1, target = 7, nums = [2, 4, 8]\r\n// This creates a local scope (context) for frame 2.\r\n// Frame 1 is isolated from changes to variables in Frame 2\r\n\r\n// Line 1 condition is false, so it keeps going\r\n// Line 2 calls groupSum(1 + 1, [2, 4, 8], 7 - 4)\r\n// which pushes a new stack frame on the call stack\r\n\r\nStack frame 3 created: groupSum(2, [2, 4, 8], 3)\r\nParameters: start = 2, target = 3, nums = [2, 4, 8]\r\n\r\n// Line 1 condition is false, so it keeps going\r\n// Line 2 calls groupSum(2 + 1, [2, 4, 8], 3 - 8)\r\n// which pushes a new stack frame on the call stack\r\n\r\nStack frame 4 created: groupSum(3, [2, 4, 8], -5)\r\nParameters: start = 3, target = -5, nums = [2, 4, 8]\r\n\r\n// Line 1 condition is true.

In (Java) IDEs, when the debugger stops on a breakpoint, you can also see the frames of the current call stack in the debugger window and the values for variables in the current scope. You can also select other frames and see where the calls started and the values for variables in that frame&#39;s scope. Some IDEs even show the local variables inline in code (as can be seen in the image below).\r\n\r\nHere is an example from IDEA Community Edition\r\n[![Call stack frames of a recursive call][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/HfgBF.png","title":"Approaches to understand backtracking better","body":"<blockquote>\n<p>i wanted to ask what helped you grasp the concept of backtracking better.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For grasping the general idea, it helped me to watch visualisations of solutions using backtracking (videos or pages with visualisations).\nFor grasping how the calls and recursive calls work, I just did a lot of step through debugging and watched some visualisations as well.</p>\n<p>From the comments that you added to your code, I can see, that you already grasped the general idea of backtracking and why those conditions and recursive calls are there.</p>\n<p>So how do computers (this is not specific to Java) perform calls and recursive calls and more importantly, how do they keep track of where to return after a call finishes executing?</p>\n<p>They use a call stack. From wikipedia</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A call stack is used for several related purposes, but the main reason for having one is to keep track of the point to which each active subroutine should return control when it finishes executing. An active subroutine is one that has been called, but is yet to complete execution, after which control should be handed back to the point of call. Such activations of subroutines may be nested to any level (recursive as a special case), hence the stack structure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A call stack keeps track of calls that are still in progress by pushing (adding) stack frames on the stack every time a call happens and popping (removing) them when an active call returns.</p>\n<p>The stack frames contain information about (simplified):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the values of the parameters of the call</li>\n<li>the return address = the position in code to return to after the call finishes executing</li>\n<li>the local variables of the called method, the context/scope</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The stack and the stack frames make recursion calls possible.</p>\n<p>I know that you already used a debugger to step through the code while it was executing, but let's do it again here on &quot;paper&quot;.</p>\n<p>I will use line numbers in your code (I also removed the comments) to make it easier to reference the lines.
