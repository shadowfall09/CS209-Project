The fix is to use identical formats. The adaptation can be done on the Dart side (export in X.509/SPKI format), on the Java side (import of a raw, uncompressed key) or via a key conversion tool.\r\n\r\nIn the following the adaption is done on the Dart side. For import/export of keys e.g. the Dart package [*basic_utils*][1] can be used. The following solution is based on the code you posted.\r\n\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Part 1: Key export&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n\r\nKey (generation via `init()` and) export can be implemented on the Dart side as follows: \r\n\r\n```dart\r\nimport &#39;package:basic_utils/basic_utils.dart&#39;;\r\nimport &#39;package:pointycastle/export.dart&#39;;\r\n...\r\nvar ecdh = EcdhHandler.init();\r\nvar x509pemFromDart = CryptoUtils.encodeEcPublicKeyToPem(ecdh.publicKey);\r\nvar sec1pemFromDart = CryptoUtils.encodeEcPrivateKeyToPem(ecdh.privateKey);\r\n...\r\nclass EcdhHandler {  \r\n  ...  \r\n  ECPublicKey get publicKey {\r\n    return _keyPair.publicKey as ECPublicKey;\r\n  }\r\n  ECPrivateKey get privateKey {\r\n    return _keyPair.privateKey as ECPrivateKey;\r\n  }\r\n  EcdhHandler.init() {\r\n    _domainParameters = ECDomainParameters(ECCurve_prime256v1().domainName);\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the following has to be considered:\r\n- Instead of `ECCurve_secp256r1()`, `ECCurve_prime256v1()` must be used, since *basic_utils* does not accept the former (error message: *ObjectIdentifier secp256r1 is not supported yet*).

If this is in fact the case it most likely isn&#39;t a connectivity problem, so the problem should be the lambda design/performance. \r\n\r\nA quick thing I would try first - if you didn’t yet - would be to increase the Lambda available memory (I think the default is 128MB). Increasing the available memory can significantly increase your Lambda performance. [[Source]](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/operating-lambda-performance-optimization-part-2/)\r\n\r\nA couple of other tips that might be useful for you to debug your problem:\r\n\r\n 1. **Review Lambda Design/Performance**: Examine the code and execution\r\n    logic of your Lambda function to ensure it is optimized for\r\n    performance. Look for any potential bottlenecks or long-running\r\n    operations that could be causing the function to exceed the timeout\r\n    limit.

They &quot;just&quot; fail due to failing assertions.\r\n\r\nAnd, BTW, I&#39;d not introduce an extra `/src/test/data` dir. I&#39;d use `/src/test/resources` because that&#39;s what it is for – Convention over Configuration.

Now, if the object is of type <code>StringBuilder</code> or <code>StringBuffer</code> the <code>equals</code> would compare the addresses of the contents in the Set and the argument of the <code>contains()</code> method.</p>\n<p>So, when we get into your example at this line <code>currentResults.contains(currentString)</code> won't work as you expected, because the <code>Set</code> will be calling <code>equals</code> on the <code>currentString</code> which is a StringBuilder. It will be something like this</p>\n<pre><code>currentString.equals(someElementInSet)\n</code></pre>\n<p>And definitely, both <code>currentString</code> and elements in the Set are in different memory locations and would return false.</p>\n<p>Now when you call <code>currentResults.contains(currentString.toString()))</code>, the value of <code>currentString</code> gets converted to a <code>String</code> type in which <code>equals</code> method checks for content rather than the memory location. So, in this case, if currentString is <strong>00</strong>, the <code>contains()</code> will return true.</p>\n<p><strong>Areas you can improve</strong></p>\n<p>Do the length check of <code>nums</code> at the beginning of the method, you don't have to run a loop if it is empty.</p>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":23740623,"reputation":1,"user_id":17758716,"display_name":"Reilas"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1686893465,"creation_date":1686893465,"answer_id":76487200,"question_id":76479481,"body_markdown":"Great question, as this is contrary to some framework methods which utilize the _Object_ parameter.  \r\nIn these cases, they are extrapolating the _StringBuilder_ through _String#valueOf_.\r\n\r\nThe difference is that the _Collections Framework_ is simply disseminating the object type, and not the content.\r\n\r\n&gt; _&quot;Does Java Set contains() know how to check for the existence of StringBuilder? ..._  \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; ...

This was the end of my output:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[javadoc]\n  D:\\Desktop\\Downloads\\logback-1.1.7.tar\\logback-1.1.7\\logback-core\\src\\test\\java\\ch\\qos\\logback\\core\\appender\\ConsoleAppenderTest.java:32:\n  error: package org.junit does not exist   <br>[javadoc] import static\n  org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;   <br>[javadoc]_______________________^<br>\n  <br>[javadoc] javadoc: error - No public or protected classes found to\n  document.   <br>[javadoc] 1 error   <br>[javadoc] 100 warnings\n  <br>\n  <br>BUILD SUCCESSFUL Total time: 2 seconds</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It does create the javadoc folder... but this is empty.</p>\n\n<p>NB about the above \"package does not exist\" error (there were many others): this one is particularly mystifying as I thought Ant somehow included junit by default (NB I am a complete newbie at Ant, just working through \"Ant in Action\").</p>\n\n<p>But... with the Ant <code>javac</code> task you can set <code>includeAntRuntime=\"true\"</code> ... according to this book that makes Ant's own <code>junit.jar</code> be included.  Unfortunately the <code>javadoc</code> task doesn't support this attribute.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>later still</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>My thinking was a bit muddled on this, to be honest: the simplest way I have found to compile javadocs from third-party source jars is just by extracting and then using the command line, typically: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>javadoc -d docs -Xmaxwarns 10 -Xmaxerrs 10 -Xdoclint:none -sourcepath\n  . -subpackages ch.qos.logback.core</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>... as for <code>javadoc</code> for one's own code this doesn't seem to be a problem in Gradle (I was only glimpsing at Ant, aware that the future is Gradle... and it's not particularly difficult to get to grips with the basics).</p>\n\n<p>NB If you install the Gradle STS plugin for Eclipse, and then create a new project using Gradle STS wizard your build file contains the line </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>apply plugin: 'eclipse'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>... one of the effects of which is that by default the source as well as the executables for all your third-party dependencies will be downloaded under GRADLE_HOME during the build.

Is there some simple built-in Java formatting (e.g., a one-line format specification) I can use to get the colon and then the padding, or do I need to write something a little more complicated?</p>\n<p>UPDATED EDIT:\n@M.Ryan gave a good answer for hard-coded field names, but is there a generic format that I could use for variable field names?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","autowired"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":18865,"reputation":25722,"user_id":43677,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"bezmax"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1465905194,"creation_date":1464952046,"answer_id":37612784,"question_id":37612387,"body_markdown":"This feature is implemented in Spring 4.3 (not yet released).\r\n\r\nYou can read more about that in the [changelog][1] (see 6.1)\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**Added:**\r\n\r\nAs about registering your unannotated classes automatically, there seems to be a flexible way to achieve this using `@ComponentScan` annotation.

And there is [XSSFWorkbook.getCustomXMLMappings](https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/dev/org/apache/poi/xssf/usermodel/XSSFWorkbook.html#getCustomXMLMappings--) which gets a `List` of all the [XSSFMap](https://poi.apache.org/apidocs/dev/org/apache/poi/xssf/usermodel/XSSFMap.html). So reading should not be the problem.\r\n\r\nBut until now there is nothing to create new `MapInfo` and/or putting additional schemas and/or maps in that `MapInfo`. So to create a new workbook having XML mappings using the low level underlaying objects is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe following complete example shows this. It provides methods to create a `MapInfo` and add schemas and maps to it. It uses the following `class.xsd` file as schema definition:\r\n\r\n    &lt;xs:schema attributeFormDefault=&quot;unqualified&quot; elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot; xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;&gt;\r\n     &lt;xs:element name=&quot;class&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;xs:complexType&gt;\r\n       &lt;xs:sequence&gt;\r\n        &lt;xs:element maxOccurs=&quot;unbounded&quot; name=&quot;student&quot;&gt;\r\n         &lt;xs:complexType&gt;\r\n          &lt;xs:sequence&gt;\r\n           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;rollno&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;\r\n           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;firstname&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;\r\n           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;lastname&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;\r\n           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;nickname&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;\r\n           &lt;xs:element name=&quot;marks&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;\r\n          &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;\r\n         &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;\r\n        &lt;/xs:element&gt;\r\n       &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;\r\n      &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;\r\n     &lt;/xs:element&gt;\r\n    &lt;/xs:schema&gt;\r\n\r\nIt creates a `MapInfo`, adds the schema and the map and creates a `XSSFMap`. Then it creates a `XSSFTable` in first scheet which refers to the map.

So to create a new workbook having XML mappings using the low level underlaying objects is necessary.</p>\n<p>The following complete example shows this. It provides methods to create a <code>MapInfo</code> and add schemas and maps to it. It uses the following <code>class.xsd</code> file as schema definition:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;xs:schema attributeFormDefault=&quot;unqualified&quot; elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot; xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;&gt;\n &lt;xs:element name=&quot;class&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;xs:complexType&gt;\n   &lt;xs:sequence&gt;\n    &lt;xs:element maxOccurs=&quot;unbounded&quot; name=&quot;student&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;xs:complexType&gt;\n      &lt;xs:sequence&gt;\n       &lt;xs:element name=&quot;rollno&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;\n       &lt;xs:element name=&quot;firstname&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;\n       &lt;xs:element name=&quot;lastname&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;\n       &lt;xs:element name=&quot;nickname&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;\n       &lt;xs:element name=&quot;marks&quot; type=&quot;xs:string&quot;/&gt;\n      &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;\n     &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;\n    &lt;/xs:element&gt;\n   &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;\n  &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;\n &lt;/xs:element&gt;\n&lt;/xs:schema&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>It creates a <code>MapInfo</code>, adds the schema and the map and creates a <code>XSSFMap</code>.
