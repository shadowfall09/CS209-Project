One of them opens up a URL and waits for an element to be present and the other method which just searches for the element. If TestNG ends up running your `loginToTours()` test method first, that is when you will see this error message. By default TestNG executes methods in an alphabetical order.

One of them opens up a URL and waits for an element to be present and the other method which just searches for the element. If TestNG ends up running your <code>loginToTours()</code> test method first, that is when you will see this error message. By default TestNG executes methods in an alphabetical order. Since <code>loginToTours()</code> doesn't specify in which web page the <code>findElement()</code> is to be located, Selenium ends up executing it on a blank page and thus you see  the error message.

Or is this impossible?</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","class","arraylist","methods"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":22354823,"reputation":16499,"user_id":16572295,"display_name":"Jo&#227;o Dias"},"score":0,"creation_date":1634222996,"post_id":69572769,"comment_id":122972405,"body_markdown":"&quot;when I run it&quot;, how exactly do you do that?","body":"&quot;when I run it&quot;, how exactly do you do that?"},{"owner":{"account_id":8896897,"reputation":53,"user_id":6641648,"display_name":"pietnam"},"score":0,"creation_date":1634223011,"post_id":69572769,"comment_id":122972414,"body_markdown":"Could you post your `viewEmployees` implementation and also show us how you&#39;re calling it?","body":"Could you post your <code>viewEmployees</code> implementation and also show us how you&#39;re calling it?"},{"owner":{"account_id":1167515,"reputation":313,"user_id":1145459,"accept_rate":50,"display_name":"Bluddymarri"},"score":0,"creation_date":1634223997,"post_id":69572769,"comment_id":122972866,"body_markdown":"Maybe to get you closer to the problem, you could also try to print the content of `addEmpName` and `addEmpEmail`, so you know that the user input actually made it&#39;s way to your variables :) Beside that, without knowing how you execute it and what the implementation of viewEmployees is, it will be hard for us to spot the issue.\n\nAlso, you might want to make yourself comfortable with the concept of debugging the code.","body":"Maybe to get you closer to the problem, you could also try to print the content of <code>addEmpName</code> and <code>addEmpEmail</code>, so you know that the user input actually made it&#39;s way to your variables :) Beside that, without knowing how you execute it and what the implementation of viewEmployees is, it will be hard for us to spot the issue.

I have doubt\r\n&gt; about how could a completed write on field being invisible to other\r\n&gt; Threads(or CPUS)?\r\n\r\nThe compiler might mess up code.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n    boolean stop;\r\n    \r\n    void run(){\r\n      while(!stop)println();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nfirst optimization\r\n\r\n    void run(){\r\n       boolean r1=stop;\r\n       while(!r1)println();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nsecond optimization\r\n\r\n    void run(){\r\n       boolean r1=stop;\r\n       if(!r1)return;\r\n       while(true) println();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo now it is obvious this loop will never stop because effectively the new value to stop will never been seen. For store you can do something similar that could indefinitely postpone it.\r\n\r\n&gt; As my understanding, a completed write means you have successfully\r\n&gt; written the filed back to cache, and according to the MESI, all others\r\n&gt; thread should have an Invalid cache line if this filed have been\r\n&gt; cached by them.\r\n\r\nCorrect. This is normally called &#39;globally visible&#39; or &#39;globally performed&#39;.\r\n\r\n&gt; One exception ( Since I am not very familiar with the hardcore, this\r\n&gt; is just a conjecture )is that maybe the result will be written back to\r\n&gt; the register instead of cache and I do not know whether there is some\r\n&gt; protocol to keep consistency in this situation or the volatile make it\r\n&gt; not to write to register in java.\r\n\r\nAll modern processors are load/store architectures (even X86 after uops conversion) meaning that there are explicit load and store instructions that transfer data between registers and memory and regular instructions like add/sub can only work with registers. So a register needs to be used anyway. The key part is that the compiler should respect the loads/stores of the source code and limit optimizations.\r\n\r\n&gt; suppose the compiler did not reorder it, what makes we see in thread2\r\n&gt; is due to the store buffer, and I do not think a write operation in\r\n&gt; store buffer means a completed write.\r\n&gt; Since the store buffer and invalidate queue strategy, which make the\r\n&gt; write on variable A looks like invisible but in fact the write\r\n&gt; operation has not finished while thread2 read A.\r\n\r\nOn the X86 the order of the stores in the store buffer are consistent with program order and will commit to the cache in program order. But there are architectures where stores from the store buffer can commit to the cache out of order e.g. due to:\r\n\r\n- write coalescing \r\n\r\n- allowing stores to commit to cache as soon as the cache line is returned in the right state no matter if an earlier still is still waiting.\r\n\r\n- sharing the store buffer with a subset of the CPUs.\r\n\r\nStore buffers can be a source of reordering; but also out of order and speculative execution can be a source.\r\n\r\nApart from the stores, reordering loads can also lead to observing stores out of order. On the X86 loads can&#39;t be reordered, but on the ARM it is allowed.

Seems it&#39;s breaking type safety!\r\n\r\nYes, you are correct.  Varargs of generic parameter types actually do violate Java&#39;s own type safety rules.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nBecause of the fact that arrays are covariant (and reified) whereas generics are invariant (and erased, or non-reified).  In the words of Joshua Bloch, &quot;arrays and generics do not play well together.&quot; The developers of the Java language made a very deliberate decision to implement the varargs language feature despite the fact that it violates type safety. They concluded that the value of having varargs (which are extensively used by the reflection and annotation facilities) justified their risks and limitations.\r\n\r\nIn Java, you cannot compile this code:\r\n\r\n    T[] genericArray = new T[SIZE];\r\n\r\nThis is illegal because instantiating an array of a non-reified type is not type safe according to Java&#39;s own type safety rules.  Yet, when a client invokes a method that has a varargs parameter of a generic type, the runtime system will instantiate an array of that generic type!  It&#39;s not type safe!\r\n\r\nIf the varargs system is not used carefully, `ClassCastException`s or other bugs can occur in the program.

Varargs of generic parameter types actually do violate Java's own type safety rules.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p>Because of the fact that arrays are covariant (and reified) whereas generics are invariant (and erased, or non-reified).  In the words of Joshua Bloch, &quot;arrays and generics do not play well together.&quot; The developers of the Java language made a very deliberate decision to implement the varargs language feature despite the fact that it violates type safety. They concluded that the value of having varargs (which are extensively used by the reflection and annotation facilities) justified their risks and limitations.</p>\n<p>In Java, you cannot compile this code:</p>\n<pre><code>T[] genericArray = new T[SIZE];\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is illegal because instantiating an array of a non-reified type is not type safe according to Java's own type safety rules.  Yet, when a client invokes a method that has a varargs parameter of a generic type, the runtime system will instantiate an array of that generic type!  It's not type safe!</p>\n<p>If the varargs system is not used carefully, <code>ClassCastException</code>s or other bugs can occur in the program.
