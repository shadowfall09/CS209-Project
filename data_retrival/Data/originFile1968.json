Generics were introduced in java 1.5. The point is - they weren&#39;t in java 1.0. That means the generics implementation has loads of bizarre edge cases, because lots of the java ecosystem was designed without them.\r\n\r\n* Both generics as well as checked exceptions are __figments of `javac`__. Both of these concepts __do not exist, at all__ at the JVM level. The JVM completely ignores generics, it has absolutely no idea what they are. The same applies to checked exceptions. java (the VM) just doesn&#39;t understand them and doesn&#39;t have to. They exist in class files solely so that, if you compile some code with `javac` and there&#39;s stuff on the classpath, that javac can read the checked exception list or the generics in a signature and generate appropriate errors, warnings, and apply some syntax sugar. __To the JVM, generics and throws clauses are comments - completely ignored by the runtime.__\r\n\r\n* Nevertheless `javac` sometimes flat out refuses to compile something even if, at bytecode/classfile/JVM level, it would be accepted. For example, at the bytecode/JVM level, it is legal for a class to have no parent class. Not even `java.lang.Object`. However, `javac` simply won&#39;t do this. The only way is to use some other compiler, or to edit the bytes in a class file by hand, or to use a bytecode tool like ASM or BCEL or whatnot. Other times, it WILL compile something even though it makes semantically no sense, and merely emits some warnings to try to protect you from your mistake. But, javac will never (unless javac is bugged) produce code that is flat out invalid (java the VM cannot read the class file, or it can but the verifier rejects it). To contrast this, this code: ```private String stringField; ... void foo() { stringField = new Object(); }```, if you could somehow manage to compile this by hacking javac or hand-wringing a class file, does not load. A ClassVerifierError will be thrown instead.\r\n\r\n* Yes, that means you can write methods that do __not__ decree that they threw e.g. `IOException` in their `throws` clause, and yet they DO throw it. Both kotlin and scala do this as part of their langspec (they don&#39;t have checked exceptions). Lombok&#39;s `@SneakyThrows` lets you write java code that does it. A few hacks, involving generics (and you&#39;ve stumbled on one of them here!) can be used to write pure java code that a vanilla javac can compile which also lets you throw checked exceptions without declaring them, however, you&#39;ll always get a warning unless you suppress it.\r\n\r\n## On to your question\r\n\r\nBullet point #1 is obvious and I assume you have no questions about it. Bullet #2 is a case of: At the bytecode/classfile/VM level it&#39;s all accepted, but javac flat out refuses to compile code it thinks makes no sense, even though if it did compile it, a JVM would run it.\r\n\r\nBullet #3 is the last case: javac WILL compile code that makes no sense, because the JVM will run it without complaint (but weirdness will ensue; in this case, it would be possible to write code that gets a surprise checked exception: One thrown by a method that does not appear to be declared to throws it), but javac will at least warn you that you&#39;re messing up.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind why the &#39;erased...&#39; bulletpoint (#2) is considered an error and the unerased bulletpoint a warning? I wasn&#39;t the designer of the erasure feature but the answer surely is this: If you take a library without generics (for example, because it was written before generics as a feature was introduced in the first place), and then add generics to it, you can end up in a scenario where bullet #3 is relevant. In order to allow library authors to update their code without having to tell their users that the new version is entirely incompatible with the old, they do warnings and not errors. If you somehow end up with code that violates what bullet #2 is talking about, that never made sense. (This in general explains why almost all violations of the type system based on generics end up causing javac to emit a warning and compile it anyway).\r\n\r\n## What does &#39;erased&#39; and &#39;unerased&#39; mean here?\r\n\r\nGenerics (the stuff in `&lt;&gt;`, such as `List&lt;String&gt;`) simply do not exist for many rules, such as when determining the fully qualified name of a method or type. That&#39;s because said rule predates generics. Then the spec will talk about first &#39;erasing&#39; the type and then working with the &#39;erased type&#39; to apply the rule. At the bytecode (and therefore class file) level, most of the generics are erased entirely, as in, they literally aren&#39;t there.\r\n\r\nExample: `List&lt;? extends Object&gt; x = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();` - that `&lt;String&gt;` part disappears entirely. It is nowhere in the class file and it is impossible to derive it from `x`. For that matter, assuming that&#39;s a local variable and not a field, so is the `&lt;? extends Object&gt;` part!). You can use `javap -c -v` to show the bytecode. You&#39;ll find no mention of this.\r\n\r\nThe generics that do exist in class files are all part of _signatures_: the type of a field, the return type, parameter types, or throws clause of a method, the param types and throws clauses of a constructor, and the extends and implements parts of your class/interface declaration: Those are the signatures. These do exist in class files (and `javap` will show it to you) but the compiler considers these __comments__, in the sense that `java` the VM will completely ignore them. They exist solely for the purpose of reflective code access and for `javac`, so that it can give you errors and warnings.\r\n\r\nThus, generics exist _solely_ to enable compiler syntax sugar and to generate compiler errors and warnings when you make mistakes. This code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nList&lt;String&gt; x = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();\r\nx.add(5.0);\r\n```\r\n\r\nis self-evidently incorrect (you&#39;re adding a double to a list of strings), but at the bytecode/VM level, if you can somehow tell javac to shut up and compile this already, it runs fine, because at the bytecode/VM level, generics do not exist, at all. The VM merely sees &#39;an ArrayList&#39;, and you add &#39;some object&#39; to it, which is fine.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s `javac`, by refusing to compile this, that is giving you type safety.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s rare, but generics are legal in throws clauses. This compiles. Try it!\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Test {\r\n    public &lt;T extends IOException&gt; foo() throws T {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith that background, let&#39;s interpret the fragment of the JLS you pasted:\r\n\r\n&gt;  that same exception class or one of its supertypes must occur in the erasure (&#167;4.6) of the throws clause of m1; otherwise, a compile-time error occurs.\r\n\r\nThe erasure in this sentence refers to the notion of erasing generics by reducing them to their lower bound. This comes up in various parts of the spec. For example, the bytecode-level full method name of e.g. `void foo(String name, int[] data)` is `foo(Ljava/lang/String;[I)V`. Generics can&#39;t be put in these names, so if you write: `&lt;N extends Number&gt; void bar(N in)`, the name becomes `bar(Ljava/lang/Number;)V`. Why? Because `Number` is the &#39;erased&#39; version of `N` here, and we need to erase because these full names (which is how code identifies an actual method in the class file. Again, you should be doing a lot of `javap` on example code if you actually want to understand any of this stuff!). Why is that? Because java 1.0 didn&#39;t support generics. Java 1.5 introduced them in a way that didn&#39;t break code written for java 1.0-1.4.\r\n\r\nIn other words, this sentence is saying, given `&lt;T extends IOException&gt; void foo() throws T`, the &#39;erasure (&#167;4.6) of the throws clause` is `throws IOException`.\r\n\r\nThus, that second bullet point is saying that this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Parent {\r\n    &lt;E extends IOException&gt; void foo() throws E {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Child extends Parent {\r\n    void foo() throws FileNotFoundException {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nis, at least as far as bullet 2 is concerned, acceptable. The erased part of `m1` here is `throws IOException`, and IOException is a supertype of m2&#39;s FileNotFoundException, thus, this is fine.\r\n\r\nContrast to:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Parent {\r\n    &lt;E extends SQLException&gt; void foo() throws E {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Child extends Parent {\r\n    void foo() throws FileNotFoundException {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis does not compile; the erased throws clause of `m1` is `throws SQLException`. SQLException is neither the same as `FileNotFoundException` nor a supertype of it, thus, bullet 2 says: Refuse to compile this an error out. Try it. It won&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nLooking at bullet 3:\r\n\r\n&gt; If the unerased throws clause of m1 does not contain a supertype of each exception type in the throws clause of m2 (adapted, if necessary, to the type parameters of m1), then a compile-time unchecked warning occurs,\r\n\r\nThis is talking about trying to do the smart thing. Here, the unerased throws clause is `E`, which is a type variable. All we know about it is that it is IOException or some subtype, and we have no idea what - every caller of this method gets to pick something. Thus, some caller might decide to make that `UnknownHostException` and now their code is all bizarro, with a method that resolves out to &#39;throws UnknownHostException&#39;, but it ends up throwing a FileNotFoundException which is bizarre as that is checked and yet it is thrown by a method that did not declare it. As mentioned at the top of this answer, the JVM is fine with it, even if `javac` isn&#39;t. Because your code can potentially now act in such a bizarre fashion, you get a warning for your troubles.\r\n\r\nThe reason it&#39;s a warning and not an error is because it is possible (but rare) that you have a library that predates 1.5 and now that generics are a thing you want to change it from `void foo() throws IOException` to `&lt;E extends IOException&gt; void foo throws E`, and the idea behind the generics introduction was that you could adapt existing libraries and give them generics without making them backwards incompatible. Thus, warnings instead of errors here.\r\n\r\nThis is not likely to come up. Generics are now 25 years old; the amount of libraries or code still in active use out there that isn&#39;t fully genericsed is now infinitesemal. Sticking typevars in throws clauses is a rare occurrence. So, it&#39;s &#39;a rare thing&#39; * &#39;a rare thing&#39; = &#39;an extremely rare one in a million shot&#39;.\r\n\r\n","title":"Unerased throws clause of a method in java","body":"<p>You need quite a bit of background to understand what's happening here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>&quot;Erasure&quot; is talking about generics. Generics were introduced in java 1.5. The point is - they weren't in java 1.0. That means the generics implementation has loads of bizarre edge cases, because lots of the java ecosystem was designed without them.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Both generics as well as checked exceptions are <strong>figments of <code>javac</code></strong>. Both of these concepts <strong>do not exist, at all</strong> at the JVM level. The JVM completely ignores generics, it has absolutely no idea what they are. The same applies to checked exceptions. java (the VM) just doesn't understand them and doesn't have to. They exist in class files solely so that, if you compile some code with <code>javac</code> and there's stuff on the classpath, that javac can read the checked exception list or the generics in a signature and generate appropriate errors, warnings, and apply some syntax sugar. <strong>To the JVM, generics and throws clauses are comments - completely ignored by the runtime.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Nevertheless <code>javac</code> sometimes flat out refuses to compile something even if, at bytecode/classfile/JVM level, it would be accepted. For example, at the bytecode/JVM level, it is legal for a class to have no parent class. Not even <code>java.lang.Object</code>. However, <code>javac</code> simply won't do this. The only way is to use some other compiler, or to edit the bytes in a class file by hand, or to use a bytecode tool like ASM or BCEL or whatnot. Other times, it WILL compile something even though it makes semantically no sense, and merely emits some warnings to try to protect you from your mistake. But, javac will never (unless javac is bugged) produce code that is flat out invalid (java the VM cannot read the class file, or it can but the verifier rejects it). To contrast this, this code: <code>private String stringField; ... void foo() { stringField = new Object(); }</code>, if you could somehow manage to compile this by hacking javac or hand-wringing a class file, does not load. A ClassVerifierError will be thrown instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Yes, that means you can write methods that do <strong>not</strong> decree that they threw e.g. <code>IOException</code> in their <code>throws</code> clause, and yet they DO throw it. Both kotlin and scala do this as part of their langspec (they don't have checked exceptions). Lombok's <code>@SneakyThrows</code> lets you write java code that does it. A few hacks, involving generics (and you've stumbled on one of them here!) can be used to write pure java code that a vanilla javac can compile which also lets you throw checked exceptions without declaring them, however, you'll always get a warning unless you suppress it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>On to your question</h2>\n<p>Bullet point #1 is obvious and I assume you have no questions about it. Bullet #2 is a case of: At the bytecode/classfile/VM level it's all accepted, but javac flat out refuses to compile code it thinks makes no sense, even though if it did compile it, a JVM would run it.</p>\n<p>Bullet #3 is the last case: javac WILL compile code that makes no sense, because the JVM will run it without complaint (but weirdness will ensue; in this case, it would be possible to write code that gets a surprise checked exception: One thrown by a method that does not appear to be declared to throws it), but javac will at least warn you that you're messing up.</p>\n<p>The reasoning behind why the 'erased...' bulletpoint (#2) is considered an error and the unerased bulletpoint a warning? I wasn't the designer of the erasure feature but the answer surely is this: If you take a library without generics (for example, because it was written before generics as a feature was introduced in the first place), and then add generics to it, you can end up in a scenario where bullet #3 is relevant. In order to allow library authors to update their code without having to tell their users that the new version is entirely incompatible with the old, they do warnings and not errors. If you somehow end up with code that violates what bullet #2 is talking about, that never made sense. (This in general explains why almost all violations of the type system based on generics end up causing javac to emit a warning and compile it anyway).</p>\n<h2>What does 'erased' and 'unerased' mean here?</h2>\n<p>Generics (the stuff in <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, such as <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code>) simply do not exist for many rules, such as when determining the fully qualified name of a method or type. That's because said rule predates generics. Then the spec will talk about first 'erasing' the type and then working with the 'erased type' to apply the rule. At the bytecode (and therefore class file) level, most of the generics are erased entirely, as in, they literally aren't there.</p>\n<p>Example: <code>List&lt;? extends Object&gt; x = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();</code> - that <code>&lt;String&gt;</code> part disappears entirely. It is nowhere in the class file and it is impossible to derive it from <code>x</code>. For that matter, assuming that's a local variable and not a field, so is the <code>&lt;? extends Object&gt;</code> part!). You can use <code>javap -c -v</code> to show the bytecode. You'll find no mention of this.</p>\n<p>The generics that do exist in class files are all part of <em>signatures</em>: the type of a field, the return type, parameter types, or throws clause of a method, the param types and throws clauses of a constructor, and the extends and implements parts of your class/interface declaration: Those are the signatures. These do exist in class files (and <code>javap</code> will show it to you) but the compiler considers these <strong>comments</strong>, in the sense that <code>java</code> the VM will completely ignore them. They exist solely for the purpose of reflective code access and for <code>javac</code>, so that it can give you errors and warnings.</p>\n<p>Thus, generics exist <em>solely</em> to enable compiler syntax sugar and to generate compiler errors and warnings when you make mistakes. This code:</p>\n<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; x = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();\nx.add(5.0);\n</code></pre>\n<p>is self-evidently incorrect (you're adding a double to a list of strings), but at the bytecode/VM level, if you can somehow tell javac to shut up and compile this already, it runs fine, because at the bytecode/VM level, generics do not exist, at all. The VM merely sees 'an ArrayList', and you add 'some object' to it, which is fine.</p>\n<p>It's <code>javac</code>, by refusing to compile this, that is giving you type safety.</p>\n<p>It's rare, but generics are legal in throws clauses. This compiles. Try it!</p>\n<pre><code>public class Test {\n    public &lt;T extends IOException&gt; foo() throws T {}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>With that background, let's interpret the fragment of the JLS you pasted:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>that same exception class or one of its supertypes must occur in the erasure (§4.6) of the throws clause of m1; otherwise, a compile-time error occurs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The erasure in this sentence refers to the notion of erasing generics by reducing them to their lower bound. This comes up in various parts of the spec. For example, the bytecode-level full method name of e.g. <code>void foo(String name, int[] data)</code> is <code>foo(Ljava/lang/String;[I)V</code>. Generics can't be put in these names, so if you write: <code>&lt;N extends Number&gt; void bar(N in)</code>, the name becomes <code>bar(Ljava/lang/Number;)V</code>. Why? Because <code>Number</code> is the 'erased' version of <code>N</code> here, and we need to erase because these full names (which is how code identifies an actual method in the class file. Again, you should be doing a lot of <code>javap</code> on example code if you actually want to understand any of this stuff!). Why is that? Because java 1.0 didn't support generics. Java 1.5 introduced them in a way that didn't break code written for java 1.0-1.4.</p>\n<p>In other words, this sentence is saying, given <code>&lt;T extends IOException&gt; void foo() throws T</code>, the 'erasure (§4.6) of the throws clause<code>is</code>throws IOException`.</p>\n<p>Thus, that second bullet point is saying that this:</p>\n<pre><code>public class Parent {\n    &lt;E extends IOException&gt; void foo() throws E {}\n}\n\nclass Child extends Parent {\n    void foo() throws FileNotFoundException {}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>is, at least as far as bullet 2 is concerned, acceptable.

It does it by &quot;emulating&quot; the execution of the Java Virtual Machine instructions (bytecodes); i.e. by pretending to be a &quot;real&quot; instance of the virtual machine.\r\n\r\nThe other JVM component that is involved is the Just In Time (JIT) compiler.

This line could be anything appendable to a JTextPane such as a custom component, a string of text, an icon, etc. If anyone knows how to remove the last &quot;thing&quot; appended to a JTextPane, I would be ever-grateful to you.</p>\n<p>EDIT: add minimal Reproducible example:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>import javax.swing.*;\nimport javax.swing.text.*;\n\npublic class Test {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        new Test();\n    }\n\n    private static final String ELEM = AbstractDocument.ElementNameAttribute;\n    private static final String ICON = StyleConstants.IconElementName;\n    private static final String COMP = StyleConstants.ComponentElementName;\n    private JTextPane outputArea;\n\n    Test() {\n        try {\n            //init pane\n            outputArea = new JTextPane();\n\n            //insert component\n            JTextField c = new JTextField(20);\n            Style cs = outputArea.getStyledDocument().addStyle(&quot;name&quot;, null);\n            StyleConstants.setComponent(cs, c);\n            outputArea.getStyledDocument().insertString(outputArea.getStyledDocument().getLength(), &quot;string&quot;, cs);\n\n            //new line\n            println(&quot;&quot;);\n\n            //add string\n            println(&quot;this is a string added to the pane&quot;);\n\n            //add image\n            outputArea.insertIcon(new ImageIcon(&quot;/path/to/image.png&quot;));\n\n            //new line\n            println(&quot;&quot;);\n\n            //before\n            printContents();\n\n            //----------------------------\n            //call removeLastLine() as many times as needed and it should remove the last added &quot;thing&quot;\n            //regardless of the order added (ex: component, text, icon should function the same as text, text, text, component obviously)\n\n            //changes should be reflected here\n            printContents();\n\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void removeLastLine() {\n        //TODO remove last line of text, last component, last image icon, etc.\n    }\n\n    public void println(String Usage) {\n        try {\n            StyledDocument document = (StyledDocument) outputArea.getDocument();\n            document.insertString(document.getLength(), Usage + &quot;\\n&quot;, null);\n            outputArea.setCaretPosition(outputArea.getDocument().getLength());\n        }\n\n        catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void printContents() {\n        try {\n            ElementIterator iterator = new ElementIterator(outputArea.getStyledDocument());\n            Element element;\n            while ((element = iterator.next()) != null) {\n                System.out.println(element);\n                AttributeSet as = element.getAttributes();\n                if (as.containsAttribute(ELEM, ICON)) {\n                    System.out.println(StyleConstants.getIcon(as).getClass());\n                }\n                else if (as.containsAttribute(ELEM, COMP)) {\n                    System.out.println(StyleConstants.getComponent(as).getClass());\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":["java","swing","jtextpane","styleddocument","word-processor"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":44852,"reputation":322224,"user_id":131872,"accept_rate":100,"display_name":"camickr"},"score":1,"creation_date":1629323434,"post_id":68839272,"comment_id":121659974,"body_markdown":"This is the way editors like Word work.

As I would expect, the threads are some high number in the 500s signifying that it is not subscribing on the main thread and using some Thread in Schedulers.io().\r\n\r\nHowever, then when I get into a new Activity, and a new ViewModel, I call the getFilteredDerivedSubject2 method that also resides in the same Repository class as the fetchData and aforementioned constructor and attributes. This other ViewModel again calls this getFilteredDerivedSubject2 method on the Main Thread. It actually returns a Single instead of a SingleSubject as I want only the functionality of a Single in my ViewModel. Its purpose is to just return the Single.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the getFilteredDerivedSubject2 method:\r\n\r\n    public Single&lt;List&lt;DerivedObject2&gt;&gt; getfilteredDerivedSubject2(){\r\n\t\r\n\t\t// FOR DEBUG PURPOSES\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;In CURRENT THREAD: &quot; + Thread.currentThread().getId());\r\n\t\t//testing firstSubject subscription\r\n        firstSubject.subscribe(i -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;firstSubject subscription\r\n\t\t\t\tIN GETFILTEREDDERIVEDSUBJECT2 CURRENT THREAD: &quot; + Thread.currentThread().getId()));\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t//testing filteredDerivedSubject2 subscription\r\n        filteredDerivedSubject2\r\n                .subscribe(i -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;filtedDerivedSubject2 subscription \r\n\t\t\t\tIN GETFILTEREDDERIVEDSUBJECT2 CURRENT THREAD: &quot; + Thread.currentThread()\r\n                .getId()));\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t// REAL PURPOSE OF METHOD\r\n        return filteredDerivedSubject2;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I again have some debugging print statements and subscriptions in order to test the threads. Here as expected, the first print statement prints out that it is in the Main Thread with the ID of &quot;2&quot;. That was expected as I again call this method from the Main Thread. Then however, the subscriptions that print out the Thread also print out the Main Thread with an ID of 2. I have no idea why. I never change any kind of threading with subscribeOn nor observeOn. I would completely expect it to keep staying on the same Thread in the 500s or whatever for each subject I subscribe to. It does not. It prints out that its Thread ID is 2.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know why this is? I understand I can fix it with a subscribeOn or observeOn operator, but I would really like to understand why the Threading is behaving this way. I am an RxJava noob. Thanks for any replies!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Here is the output from the print statements that were requested:\r\n\r\n    I/System.out: Main thread ID: 2\r\n    I/System.out: firstSubject subscription IN FETCHDATA, CURRENT THREAD: 224\r\n    filtedDerivedSubject2 subscription IN FETCHDATA, CURRENT THREAD: 224\r\n    I/System.out: in CURRENT THREAD: 2\r\n    I/System.out: firstSubject subscription IN GETFILTEREDDERIVEDSUBJECT2 \r\n    CURRENT THREAD: 2\r\n    I/System.out: filtedDerivedSubject2 subscription IN \r\n    GETFILTEREDDERIVEDSUBJECT2 CURRENT THREAD: 2\r\n\r\nThese are all the relevant print statements that are the result of the print statements in the code I posted.

Thanks for any replies!</p>\n<p>EDIT: Here is the output from the print statements that were requested:</p>\n<pre><code>I/System.out: Main thread ID: 2\nI/System.out: firstSubject subscription IN FETCHDATA, CURRENT THREAD: 224\nfiltedDerivedSubject2 subscription IN FETCHDATA, CURRENT THREAD: 224\nI/System.out: in CURRENT THREAD: 2\nI/System.out: firstSubject subscription IN GETFILTEREDDERIVEDSUBJECT2 \nCURRENT THREAD: 2\nI/System.out: filtedDerivedSubject2 subscription IN \nGETFILTEREDDERIVEDSUBJECT2 CURRENT THREAD: 2\n</code></pre>\n<p>These are all the relevant print statements that are the result of the print statements in the code I posted. For clarification the &quot;in CURRENT THREAD: 2&quot; is the first print statement in the getfilteredDerivedSubject2 method.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","spring","maven","dependencies","dependency-management"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":9701434,"reputation":34,"user_id":10834855,"display_name":"Aakash Thomas"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1633506607,"creation_date":1633506607,"answer_id":69461746,"question_id":69461630,"body_markdown":"This is a dependency injection only, you are able to access the child project(dependency) functionalities in your Test Project as long as it is in your classpath.\r\n\r\nIn your case, I see both Worker class is on the same package?","title":"Package class override in maven project dependency, what is this behavior called?","body":"<p>This is a dependency injection only, you are able to access the child project(dependency) functionalities in your Test Project as long as it is in your classpath.</p>\n<p>In your case, I see both Worker class is on the same package?</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":11204808,"reputation":43,"user_id":8220741,"display_name":"Marco Arnone"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":260,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1633506607,"creation_date":1633506021,"question_id":69461630,"body_markdown":"I have a **dependency project** where I define following class\r\n\r\n    package it.dependency.common;\r\n    \r\n    public class Consumer {\r\n        public void consume() {\r\n            Worker dependency = new Worker();\r\n            dependency.work();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    package it.dependency.common;\r\n    \r\n    public class Worker {\r\n        public void work() {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;I&#39;m doing things in the DEPENDENCY project&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf I run a simple main that call the mathod `consume()` of the Consumer object it prints correctly *I&#39;m doing things in the DEPENDENCY project*.\r\n\r\nI compile this maven project into a jar and I import it in a other project as a dependency in a other project called **test project**\r\n\r\n    &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n        &lt;groupId&gt;org.example&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;dependency&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;\r\n        &lt;systemPath&gt;${lib.path}/dependency-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar&lt;/systemPath&gt;\r\n    &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\n I can redefine an other class like\r\n\r\n    package it.dependency.common;\r\n    \r\n    public class Worker {\r\n        public void work() {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;I&#39;m doing things in the TEST project&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\nNow, if I run a simple main where I call the Consumer class of the DEPENDENCY project it prints *I&#39;m doing things in the TEST project*.\r\n\r\nSo the consumer actually uses the Worker class of a project that it don&#39;t know.
