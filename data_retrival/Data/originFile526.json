This solution requires the [Caffeine library][1] which is a [java 1.8+ rewrite][1] of Google&#39;s `Guava library`. You are going to use the `LoadingCache` class for storing the request counts and client ip addresses. You will also be needing the `javax.servlet-api` dependency because you will want to use a `servlet filter` where the request counting takes place. Heres the code:\r\n\r\n\r\n    import javax.servlet.Filter;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    @Component\r\n    public class requestThrottleFilter implements Filter {\r\n    \r\n        private int MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND = 5; //or whatever you want it to be\r\n    \r\n        private LoadingCache&lt;String, Integer&gt; requestCountsPerIpAddress;\r\n    \r\n        public requestThrottleFilter(){\r\n          super();\r\n          requestCountsPerIpAddress = Caffeine.newBuilder().\r\n                expireAfterWrite(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS).build(new CacheLoader&lt;String, Integer&gt;() {\r\n            public Integer load(String key) {\r\n                return 0;\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void doFilter(ServletRequest servletRequest, ServletResponse servletResponse, FilterChain filterChain)\r\n                throws IOException, ServletException {\r\n            HttpServletRequest httpServletRequest = (HttpServletRequest) servletRequest;\r\n            HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse = (HttpServletResponse) servletResponse;\r\n            String clientIpAddress = getClientIP((HttpServletRequest) servletRequest);\r\n            if(isMaximumRequestsPerSecondExceeded(clientIpAddress)){\r\n              httpServletResponse.setStatus(HttpStatus.TOO_MANY_REQUESTS.value());\r\n              httpServletResponse.getWriter().write(&quot;Too many requests&quot;);\r\n              return;\r\n             }\r\n    \r\n            filterChain.doFilter(servletRequest, servletResponse);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        private boolean isMaximumRequestsPerSecondExceeded(String clientIpAddress){\r\n          Integer requests = 0;\r\n          requests = requestCountsPerIpAddress.get(clientIpAddress);\r\n          if(requests != null){\r\n              if(requests &gt; MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND) {\r\n                requestCountsPerIpAddress.asMap().remove(clientIpAddress);\r\n                requestCountsPerIpAddress.put(clientIpAddress, requests);\r\n                return true;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n          } else {\r\n            requests = 0;\r\n          }\r\n          requests++;\r\n          requestCountsPerIpAddress.put(clientIpAddress, requests);\r\n          return false;\r\n          }\r\n    \r\n        public String getClientIP(HttpServletRequest request) {\r\n            String xfHeader = request.getHeader(&quot;X-Forwarded-For&quot;);\r\n            if (xfHeader == null){\r\n                return request.getRemoteAddr();\r\n            }\r\n            return xfHeader.split(&quot;,&quot;)[0]; // voor als ie achter een proxy zit\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void destroy() {\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo what this basically does is it stores all request making ip addresses in a `LoadingCache`. This is like a special map in which each entry has an expiration time. In the constructor the expiration time is set to 1 second. That means that on the first request an ip address plus its request count is only stored in the LoadingCache for one second. It is automatically removed from the map on expiration. If during that second more requests are coming from the ip address then the `isMaximumRequestsPerSecondExceeded(String clientIpAddress)` will add those requests to the total request count but before that checks whether the maximum request amount per second has already been exceeded. If thats the case it returns true and the filter returns an error response with statuscode 429 which stands for Too many requests.\r\n\r\nThis way only a set amount of requests can be made per user per second.\r\n\r\nHere is the `Caffeine` dependency to add to your `pom.xml` \r\n\r\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;com.github.ben-manes.caffeine&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;caffeine&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n            &lt;exclusions&gt;\r\n                &lt;exclusion&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;logback-classic&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;groupId&gt;ch.qos.logback&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n                &lt;/exclusion&gt;\r\n                &lt;exclusion&gt;\r\n                    &lt;artifactId&gt;log4j-over-slf4j&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n                    &lt;groupId&gt;org.slf4j&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n                &lt;/exclusion&gt;\r\n            &lt;/exclusions&gt;\r\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\nPlease note the `&lt;exclusion&gt;` part. I am using `log4j2` as a logger library instead of Spring&#39;s default `logback` library. If you _are_ using `logback` then you should remove the `&lt;exclusion&gt;` part from these POM dependency or logging will not be enabled for this library.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Make sure you let Spring do a component scan on the package where you have your Filter saved or else the Filter won&#39;t work. Also, because it is annotated with @Component the filter will work for all endpoints by default (/*).\r\n\r\nIf spring detected your filter you should see something like this in the log during startup.\r\n\r\n`o.s.b.w.servlet.FilterRegistrationBean   : Mapping filter:&#39;requestThrottleFilter&#39; to: [/*]`\r\n\r\nEDIT 19-01-2022:\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve noticed that my initial solution has one drawback when it comes to blocking too many requests and i&#39;ve changed the code because of it. I&#39;ll first explain why.\r\n\r\nConsider a user can make 3 requests per second. Lets imagine that within a given second the user makes the first request during the first 200 milliseconds of that second. This causes an entry for that user to be added to `requestCountsPerIpAddress` and entry will automatically expire after one second. Now consider that this same user makes 4 successive requests only in the final 100 milliseconds before the second elapses and the entry is deleted. That means that the user effectively only gets blocked for a mere 100 milliseconds at maximum on the fourth request attempt. After those 100 milliseconds pass he&#39;ll be able to immediately make three new requests.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this he is also able to make 5 requests within a second instead of 3. This can happen when there is atleast a 500 millisecond delay between the first request (which creates the entry in the `LoadingCache`) and the next two requests (both made in the last 500 milliseconds before the current entry expires). if the user then immediately makes 3 requests right after the entry expired he will effectively manage to make 5 requests within a timespan of 1 second, whereas only 3 are allowed (2 made during the last 500 ms before the previous entry expired + 3 made during the first 500ms of the new one). So that&#39;s not a very efficient way to throttle the requests.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve changed the library to caffeine because there are some deadlock issues with guava library. If you want to keep using guava library itself you should add this line `requestCountsPerIpAddress.asMap().remove(clientIpAddress);` right under `if(requests &gt; MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND) {` in the code. What this basically does is remove the current entry for the ip address. Then on the next line it gets added again which resets the expiry time back to one whole second for that entry. \r\n\r\nThis has the effect that anyone who just keeps spamming the REST endpoint with requests will indefinitely get a 409 response back until the user stops sending requests for one second after his last request.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/issues/258","title":"How to set rate limit for each user in Spring Boot?","body":"<p>Here is a solution for those who seek to throttle the requests per second for each user (ip address).

I'll first explain why.</p>\n<p>Consider a user can make 3 requests per second. Lets imagine that within a given second the user makes the first request during the first 200 milliseconds of that second. This causes an entry for that user to be added to <code>requestCountsPerIpAddress</code> and entry will automatically expire after one second. Now consider that this same user makes 4 successive requests only in the final 100 milliseconds before the second elapses and the entry is deleted. That means that the user effectively only gets blocked for a mere 100 milliseconds at maximum on the fourth request attempt. After those 100 milliseconds pass he'll be able to immediately make three new requests.</p>\n<p>As a consequence of this he is also able to make 5 requests within a second instead of 3. This can happen when there is atleast a 500 millisecond delay between the first request (which creates the entry in the <code>LoadingCache</code>) and the next two requests (both made in the last 500 milliseconds before the current entry expires). if the user then immediately makes 3 requests right after the entry expired he will effectively manage to make 5 requests within a timespan of 1 second, whereas only 3 are allowed (2 made during the last 500 ms before the previous entry expired + 3 made during the first 500ms of the new one). So that's not a very efficient way to throttle the requests.</p>\n<p>I've changed the library to caffeine because there are some deadlock issues with guava library. If you want to keep using guava library itself you should add this line <code>requestCountsPerIpAddress.asMap().remove(clientIpAddress);</code> right under <code>if(requests &gt; MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND) {</code> in the code. What this basically does is remove the current entry for the ip address. Then on the next line it gets added again which resets the expiry time back to one whole second for that entry.</p>\n<p>This has the effect that anyone who just keeps spamming the REST endpoint with requests will indefinitely get a 409 response back until the user stops sending requests for one second after his last request.</p>\n"}],"owner":{"account_id":10784878,"reputation":2692,"user_id":7934206,"accept_rate":77,"display_name":"Ricky"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":83792,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":47,"accepted_answer_id":44549726,"answer_count":3,"score":47,"last_activity_date":1680583037,"creation_date":1495095976,"question_id":44042412,"body_markdown":"I am developing a Spring Boot Rest API which handles a lots of incoming request calls.

Silly, and confusing: January is 0, December is 11. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, the *java.time* classes use sane counting. Months run 1-12 for January-December.\r\n\r\n\r\n## *java.time*\r\n\r\nThe `java.util.Date` class was replaced by `java.time.Instant`, both representing a moment as seen in UTC, that is, with an offset from UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds.\r\n\r\nYour inputs of year-month-day can be replaced with a [`java.time.LocalDate`][2] object. That class represents a date-only value, without time-of-day, and without time zone or offset.\r\n\r\nYour method name `getDate` is not very descriptive. Apparently you want to determine the first moment of the day on the specified date as seen in UTC (an offset of zero). So we can use the descriptive name `firstMomentOfTheDayInUtc`. \r\n\r\nTo [determine the first moment of the day][3], always let *java.time* do the work. Never assume the day starts at 00:00. Some days on some dates in some time zones start at another time, such as 01:00. In UTC, we do know that every day starts at 00:00 by definition, but still we can let *java.time* figure that out. We end up with a `ZonedDateTime` object, representing a moment as seen through the wall-clock time of a particular time zone. \r\n\r\nThe `Instant` class is the basic building block of *java.time*. So from our `ZonedDateTime` object we extract an `Instant`, and return the object from our method.\r\n\r\n    private Instant firstMomentOfTheDayInUtc ( LocalDate localDate ) \r\n    {\r\n        ZonedDateTime zdt = localDate.atStartOfDay( ZoneOffset.UTC ) ;\r\n        Instant instant = zdt.toInstant() ;\r\n        return instant ;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen you want to get the elapsed time between two of these `Instant` objects as a count of whole seconds. No need for your method `getDaysBetween`, as the code is so simple and brief in *java.time*. \r\n\r\nThe `Duration` class represents a span-of-time not attached to the timeline.\r\n\r\n    Duration duration = Duration.between( instantX , instantY ) ;\r\n\r\nThen interrogate for a total number of seconds. \r\n\r\n    long seconds = duration.toSeconds() ;\r\n\r\nBut seconds is not needed to address your ultimate goal. If you merely want to know the number of elapsed calendar days, use the enum object [`ChronoUnit.DAYS`][4] and its [`between`][5] method.\r\n\r\n    long daysElapsed = \r\n        ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(\r\n            LocalDate.of( 2023 , 1 , 1 ) , \r\n            LocalDate.of( 2023 , 2 , 1 )\r\n        );\r\n   \r\n\r\n # Octal literals\r\n\r\nYour code:\r\n\r\n    getDate(2023, 01, 01)\r\n\r\nAs [commented by Ole V.V.][6], be careful with your numeric literals. Leading with a zero digit marks the literal as an octal (base 8) number rather than a decimal (base 10) number. \r\n\r\n - `01` through `07` you can get away with. Those octals are the same as decimals. \r\n - `08` &amp; `09` are nonsense, and won’t compile.\r\n - `010` is 8, `011` is 9. \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/75915365/642706\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/time/LocalDate.html\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/time/LocalDate.html#atStartOfDay(java.time.ZoneId)\r\n  [4]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/time/temporal/ChronoUnit.html#DAYS\r\n  [5]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.base/java/time/temporal/ChronoUnit.html#between(java.time.temporal.Temporal,java.time.temporal.Temporal)\r\n  [6]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75915340/counting-number-of-days-between-date-in-java-using-seconds-results-in-fewer-days/75915612#comment133901896_75915340","title":"Counting number of days between date in Java using seconds results in fewer days?","body":"<h1>tl;dr</h1>\n<p>If you really want a count of seconds.</p>\n<pre><code>Duration\n.between(\n    LocalDate\n    .of( y1 , m1 , d1 )               // Returns a `LocalDate` object.\n    .atStartOfDay( ZoneOffset.UTC )   // Returns a `ZonedDateTime` object.\n    .toInstant() ,                    // Returns a `Instant` object.\n    LocalDate\n    .of( y2 , m2 , d2 ) \n    .atStartOfDay( ZoneOffset.UTC )\n    .toInstant() ,\n)                                     // Returns a `Duration` object.\n.toSeconds()                          // Returns a `long` primitive value.\n</code></pre>\n<p>But if you want to count the number of calendar days between dates, you are working much too hard.</p>\n<pre><code>long daysElapsed = \n    ChronoUnit\n    .DAYS\n    .between(\n        LocalDate.of( 2023 , 1 , 1 ) , \n        LocalDate.of( 2023 , 2 , 1 )\n    )\n;\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Details</h1>\n<h2>Avoid legacy date-time classes</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/75915365/642706\">Answer by Zedki</a> is technically correct but uses terribly flawed date-time classes that were years ago supplanted by the modern <em>java.time</em> classes defined by JSR 310.</p>\n<p>One of the many flaws in the <code>Calendar</code> class is that it counts the month number by zero-based index counting. Silly, and confusing: January is 0, December is 11.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the <em>java.time</em> classes use sane counting.

That class represents a date-only value, without time-of-day, and without time zone or offset.</p>\n<p>Your method name <code>getDate</code> is not very descriptive.

Here is a simplified code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class Container extends JPanel {\n\n    public Container() {\n        super();\n        this.setBackground(Color.WHITE);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The JFrame constructor contains the line:</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.setContentPane(mainContainer);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Have I missed something?</p>\n\n<p>Thx.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","hadoop","java-8","mapreduce","data-science"],"owner":{"account_id":24846375,"reputation":25,"user_id":18723865,"display_name":"Data_Science_Mick"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1680558597,"creation_date":1680558597,"question_id":75924017,"body_markdown":"I am new to Hadoop.

But I would like to emphasize that your needs will likely to increase rapidly and therefore you may need to move to a RESTful framework (e.g.: Spring WS, Apache CXF) down the road.\r\n\r\nYou need to register URIs and get parameters using the standard servlet technology. Maybe you can start here: [http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13222_01/wls/docs92/webapp/configureservlet.html][1]\r\n\r\nNext, you need a JSON provider and serialize (aka marshall) it in JSON format. I recommend JACKSON.

But I would like to emphasize that your needs will likely to increase rapidly and therefore you may need to move to a RESTful framework (e.g.: Spring WS, Apache CXF) down the road.</p>\n\n<p>You need to register URIs and get parameters using the standard servlet technology.

I know that google also has a transliterate API, but it is deprecated since 2011 and i feel like this must be built into the translate API and there seems to be only a JS version of the transliterate API.\n(<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/transliterate/v1/getting_started\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://developers.google.com/transliterate/v1/getting_started</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>Does anyone know how one can request/receive this the transliterated term or written pronounciation from the google cloud translate API?</strong> Maybe i missed it in the documentation, in which case i would appreciate any input for redirection.</p>\n"},{"tags":["java","android","android-contentprovider","mediastore"],"comments":[{"owner":{"account_id":16768304,"reputation":8503,"user_id":12121419,"display_name":"blackapps"},"score":0,"creation_date":1675838969,"post_id":75378709,"comment_id":133011927,"body_markdown":"`file is stored in Music/MP4TestFiles` Well then String audiodir = &quot;Music/MP4TestFiles&quot;;","body":"<code>file is stored in Music&#47;MP4TestFiles</code> Well then String audiodir = &quot;Music/MP4TestFiles&quot;;"},{"owner":{"account_id":2020103,"reputation":550,"user_id":1806493,"display_name":"GGK stands for Ukraine"},"score":0,"creation_date":1675883616,"post_id":75378709,"comment_id":133026000,"body_markdown":"no, thats not correct, as I use %DIR% and like operator in query","body":"no, thats not correct, as I use %DIR% and like operator in query"}],"owner":{"account_id":2020103,"reputation":550,"user_id":1806493,"display_name":"GGK stands for Ukraine"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"reopen_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1680554562,"creation_date":1675802013,"question_id":75378709,"body_markdown":"I got a MP4 File (MIME_TYPE = audio/x-m4a) which I can&#39;t find querying `mediastore`.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a video or an audio file, so I try to query File table of `mediastore` (also check video and audio table with same result).\r\n\r\nThe file is stored in Music/MP4TestFiles Folder on internal storage (not on an SD-Card, not stored in internal app storage).\r\n\r\nTesting on Android 13.\r\n\r\n    Uri uri = MediaStore.Files.getContentUri(MediaStore.VOLUME_EXTERNAL);\r\n    String audiodir = &quot;%MP4TestFiles%&quot;;\r\n    String[] projection = new String[] {\r\n                MediaStore.Files.FileColumns.MIME_TYPE,\r\n                MediaStore.Files.FileColumns.DATA,\r\n                MediaStore.Files.FileColumns.DISPLAY_NAME,\r\n                MediaStore.Files.FileColumns.DATE_ADDED,\r\n                MediaStore.Files.FileColumns._ID};\r\n\r\n    String selection = MediaStore.Files.FileColumns.RELATIVE_PATH+ &quot; like ?

Firstly look at lines generally and then cut segments from them. Below I use notations for given segments `((x1, x2), (y1, y2))` and `((x3, x4), (y3, y4))`.\r\n\r\n1. Check if any of the lines is vertical (`x1 == x2` or `x3 == x4`).  \r\n\r\n a. If both are vertical and `x1 != x3`, then no intersection. \r\n   \r\n b. If both are vertical and `x1 == x3`, check if `(y1, y2)` and `(y3, y4)` overlap.\r\n\r\n c. If only one is vertical (say, first one), then build the equation of the second line (as outlined below), find the point where two lines intersect (by substituting `x1` into the equation of the second line) and check if this point is within both segments (similar to step 5).\r\n\r\n d. If not, proceed.\r\n\r\n2. Use the points coordinates to build lines equations in form `y = a*x + b` (like [here][1]).\r\n\r\n        a1 = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)\r\n        b1 = y1 - a1*x1 \r\n        a2 = (y4-y3)/(x4-x3)\r\n        b2 = y3 - a2*x3\r\n\r\n3. Check if lines are parallel (same slope `a`). If yes, check if they have same intercept `b`. If yes, check if 1D segments `(x1, x2)` and `(x3, x4)` overlap. If yes, your segments do overlap. The case when lines are parallel can be ambiguous. If they overlap, you can consider it as an intersection (it even can be one point if their ends are touching), or not. Note: if you are working with floats it would be a bit trickier, I reckon you would want to ignore this. In case you have only integers checking if `a1 = a2` is equivalent to:\r\n\r\n        if((y2-y1)*(x4-x3) == (x2-x1)*(y4-y3))\r\n\r\n4. If lines are not parallel. The point of intersection is equivalent to a solution of a system of equations representing the two lines. Really, `y = a1*x + b1` and `y = a2*x + b2` intersecting basically means that both of these equations hold. Solve this system by equating the two right sides and it will give you the intersection point. In fact, you need only `x` coordinate of the intersection (draw it and you&#39;ll see why):\r\n\r\n        x0 = -(b1-b2)/(a1-a2)\r\n\r\n5. Last step is to check if the intersection point `x0` lies within both segments. That is, `min(x1, x2) &lt; x0 &lt; max(x1, x2)` and `min(x3, x4) &lt; x0 &lt; max(x3, x4)`. If yes, your lines do intersect!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/line-equation-2points.html\r\n  [2]: http://www.cliffsnotes.com/study_guide/Linear-Equations-Solutions-Using-Determinants-with-Two-Variables.topicArticleId-257309,articleId-257119.html","title":"Calculation of intersections between line segments","body":"<p>The first piece of code you show is based on vector cross-product, which has been explained here <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/563198/how-do-you-detect-where-two-line-segments-intersect\">How do you detect where two line segments intersect?</a> in a great detail.</p>\n\n<p>IMO, an easier way of understanding it is through solving a system of equations.

Below I use notations for given segments <code>((x1, x2), (y1, y2))</code> and <code>((x3, x4), (y3, y4))</code>.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Check if any of the lines is vertical (<code>x1 == x2</code> or <code>x3 == x4</code>).  </p>\n\n<p>a. If both are vertical and <code>x1 != x3</code>, then no intersection. </p>\n\n<p>b. If both are vertical and <code>x1 == x3</code>, check if <code>(y1, y2)</code> and <code>(y3, y4)</code> overlap.</p>\n\n<p>c. If only one is vertical (say, first one), then build the equation of the second line (as outlined below), find the point where two lines intersect (by substituting <code>x1</code> into the equation of the second line) and check if this point is within both segments (similar to step 5).</p>\n\n<p>d. If not, proceed.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use the points coordinates to build lines equations in form <code>y = a*x + b</code> (like <a href=\"http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/line-equation-2points.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<pre><code>a1 = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)\nb1 = y1 - a1*x1 \na2 = (y4-y3)/(x4-x3)\nb2 = y3 - a2*x3\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Check if lines are parallel (same slope <code>a</code>). If yes, check if they have same intercept <code>b</code>. If yes, check if 1D segments <code>(x1, x2)</code> and <code>(x3, x4)</code> overlap. If yes, your segments do overlap. The case when lines are parallel can be ambiguous. If they overlap, you can consider it as an intersection (it even can be one point if their ends are touching), or not. Note: if you are working with floats it would be a bit trickier, I reckon you would want to ignore this. In case you have only integers checking if <code>a1 = a2</code> is equivalent to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if((y2-y1)*(x4-x3) == (x2-x1)*(y4-y3))\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>If lines are not parallel. The point of intersection is equivalent to a solution of a system of equations representing the two lines. Really, <code>y = a1*x + b1</code> and <code>y = a2*x + b2</code> intersecting basically means that both of these equations hold. Solve this system by equating the two right sides and it will give you the intersection point. In fact, you need only <code>x</code> coordinate of the intersection (draw it and you'll see why):</p>\n\n<pre><code>x0 = -(b1-b2)/(a1-a2)\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Last step is to check if the intersection point <code>x0</code> lies within both segments. That is, <code>min(x1, x2) &lt; x0 &lt; max(x1, x2)</code> and <code>min(x3, x4) &lt; x0 &lt; max(x3, x4)</code>. If yes, your lines do intersect!</p></li>\n</ol>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":9599084,"reputation":11,"user_id":7127290,"display_name":"user7127290"},"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1478534230,"creation_date":1478534230,"answer_id":40469303,"question_id":16314069,"body_markdown":"\tpublic void fixData()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tslope = (p2.getY() - p1.getY()) / (p2.getX() - p1.getX());\r\n\t\tyInt = p1.getY() - slope * p1.getX();\r\n\t\txInt = (-yInt) / slope;\r\n\t}\r\n\t","title":"Calculation of intersections between line segments","body":"<pre><code>public void fixData()\n{\n    slope = (p2.getY() - p1.getY()) / (p2.getX() - p1.getX());\n    yInt = p1.getY() - slope * p1.getX();\n    xInt = (-yInt) / slope;\n}\n</code></pre>\n"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"account_id":174366,"reputation":12158,"user_id":403682,"accept_rate":95,"display_name":"Kenny Cason"},"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":6,"is_accepted":false,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1482348874,"creation_date":1482348874,"answer_id":41270603,"question_id":16314069,"body_markdown":"I really @sashkello&#39;s answer and find it to be more intuitive and easier to explain than the vector implementation.
